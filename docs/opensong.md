# OpenSOng setup

1. Install OpenSong
1. Copy Files into `MyDocuments/OpenSong/`
    - `Songs`
    - `Scripture`
1. Start OpenSong and check the settings for file locations, use the default location for simplicity.

We should see the songs listed, if we do not, 
then we have copied the files to the wrong location, 
or we need to restart Opensong.
