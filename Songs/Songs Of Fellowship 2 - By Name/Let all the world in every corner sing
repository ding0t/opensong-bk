[V1]
 Let all the world in every corner sing:
 'My God and King!'
 The heavens are not too high;
 His praise may thither fly:
 The earth is not too low;
 His praises there may grow.
 Let all the world in every corner sing:
 'My God and King!'
[V2]
 Let all the world in every corner sing:
 'My God and King!'
 The Church with psalms must shout,
 No door can keep them out:
 But, above all, the heart
 Must bear the longest part.
 Let all the world in every corner sing:
 'My God and King!'
