[V1]
 Here in the presence of the
 Great and awesome God.
 Here in the presence of the Holy One,
 The only One.
 Knowing not how best to bring adoring love,
 To bow, to weep, to fall, and yet
 You whisper, 'Child, draw near:
[C1]
 And stand in the presence of the Lord,
 Stand in the presence of the Lord,
 Stand in the presence of the Holy One,
 Stand in the presence of the Lord.'
[V2]
 Here in the presence of the
 Great and awesome God,
 Majestic in His power yet full of grace:
 I seek His face.
 The passion in His eyes
 Searches deep inside:
 Such shining love intensifies,
 Yet melts away my fears.
[C2]
 And I stand in the presence of the Lord,
 Stand in the presence of the Lord,
 Stand in the presence of the Holy One,
 Stand in the presence of the Lord.'
