[V1]
 Lord, I have heard of Your fame,
 I stand in awe of Your deeds. O Lord,
 I have heard of Your fame,
 I stand in awe of Your deeds, O Lord.
[V2]
 Renew them, renew them,
 In our day, and in our time
 Make them known.
 Renew them, renew them,
 In our day, and in our time
 Make them known.
 In wrath remember mercy.
