[V1]
 Let us draw near with confidence,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 There's mercy enough for all our sins,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 ||He was made weak and He was tried,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 He's able to feel and sympathise,
 We have a Great High Priest.
[C]
 He's the Lamb of God,
 Slain before the ages,
 The only Son,
 The Servant crowned as King.
 The One who came
 To crush the works of darkness,
 And He will fill all things, all things.
[V2]
 Let us each come with conscience cleansed,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 It's by His shed blood we enter in,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 ||We trust in no merits of our own,
 We have a Great High Priest.
 But look to the power of the cross alone,
 We have a Great High Priest.
