  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Give your thanks to the risen son. (Leader - all echo)
 To the holy and anointed one. (echo)
 Who fills our hearts with a joyful song. (echo)
 Jesus. (echo)
[V2]
 Turn to Him, don't be afraid,
 Give Him honour, give Him praise.
 Lift Him up to the highest place.
 Jesus.
[V3]
 Worship Him, crown Him King,
 And give Him all your heart.
 (Repeat)
