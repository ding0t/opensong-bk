[V1]
 Whatever I have gained,
 Whatever I have done,
 I leave it all behind to follow You.
 The things that I attained,
 The goals I may have gained,
 A prize or any glory of my own.
[C]
 For I am lost without Your love,
 All things are loss without Your love;
 For I am lost without Your love,
 All things are loss without Your love.
[V2]
 The wonder of Your love,
 The wonder of Your grace;
 To gain You and to know You as my Lord.
 That I am found in You,
 Your righteousness alone,
 Is more than I could dream or ever ask.
