  <lyrics>
[V1]
 To be in Your presence,
 To sit at Your feet,
 Where Your love surrounds me,
 And makes me complete.
[C]
 This is my desire, O Lord,
 This is my desire.
 This is my desire, O Lord,
 This is my desire.
[V2]
 To rest in Your presence,
 Not rushing away;
 To cherish each moment,
 Here I would stay.
