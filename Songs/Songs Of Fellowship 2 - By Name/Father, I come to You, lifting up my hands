[V1]
 Father, I come to You, lifting up my hands
 In the name of Jesus, by Your grace I stand.
 Just because You love me and I love Your Son,
 I know Your favour, unending love.
[V2]
 I receive Your favour, Your unending love,
 Not because I've earned it, not for what I've done;
 Just because You love me and I love Your Son,
 I know Your favour, unending love.
[C]
 Unending love,
 Your unending love.
[V3]
 It's the presence of Your kingdom as Your glory fills this place,
 And I see how much You love me as I look into Your face.
 Nothing could be better, there's nothing I would trade
 For Your favour, unending love.
