[V1]
 Say the word, I will be healed;
 You are the great Physician,
 You meet every need.
 Say the word, I will be free;
 Where chains have held me captive,
 Come sing Your songs to me,
 Say the word.
[V2]
 Say the word, I will be filled;
 My hands reach out to heaven,
 Where striving is stilled.
 Say the word, I will be changed;
 Where I am dry and thirsty,
 Send cool, refreshing rain,
 Say the word.
[V3]
 His tears have fallen like rain on my life;
 Each drop a fresh revelation.
 I will return to the place of the cross,
 Where grace and mercy
 Pour from heaven's throne.
[V4]
 Say the word, I will be poor,
 That I might know the riches
 That You have in store.
 Say the word, I will be weak;
 Your strength will be the power
 That satisfies the meek.
 Say the word.
[V5]
 The Lord will see the travail of His soul,
 And He and I will be satisfied.
 Complete the work You have started in me:
 O, come Lord Jesus, shake my life again.
