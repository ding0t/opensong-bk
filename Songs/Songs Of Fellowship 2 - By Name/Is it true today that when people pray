[V1]
 Is it true today that when people pray,
 Cloudless skies will break,
 Kings and queens will shake?
[B]
 Yes it's true, and I believe it,
 I'm living for You.
[V2]
 Well it's true today that when people pray
 We'll see dead men rise,
 And the blind set free?
[C]
 I'm gonna be a history maker in this land.
 I'm gonna be a speaker of truth
 To all mankind.
 I'm gonna stand,
 I'm gonna run into Your arms,
 Into Your arms again,
 Into Your arms, into Your arms again.
[V3]
 Well it's true today that when people stand
 With the fire of God and the truth in hand,
 We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing,
 We'll see broken hearts making history?
