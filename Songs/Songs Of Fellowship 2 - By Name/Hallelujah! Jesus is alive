[V1]
 Hallelujah! Jesus is alive,
 Death has lost its victory
 And the grave has been denied;
 Jesus lives forever,
 He's alive, He's alive!
[V2]
 He's the Alpha and Omega,
 The First and Last is He;
 The curse of sin is broken
 And we have perfect liberty.
 The Lamb of God has risen,
 He's alive, He's alive! 
[V3]
 Hallelujah! Jesus is alive,
 Death has lost its victory
 And the grave has been denied;
 Jesus lives forever,
 He's alive, He's alive!
 Hallelujah! Jesus is alive!
