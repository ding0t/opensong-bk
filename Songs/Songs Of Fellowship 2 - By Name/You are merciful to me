  <lyrics>
[C]
 You are merciful to me,
 You are merciful to me,
 You are merciful to me, my Lord.
 You are merciful to me,
 You are merciful to me,
 You are merciful to me, my Lord.
[V1]
 Every day my disobedience
 Grieves Your loving heart;
 But then redeeming love breaks through,
 And causes me to worship You.
[V2]
 (Men - Women echo)
 Redeemer,
 Saviour,
 Healer
 And Friend.
 Every day
 Renew my ways,
 Fill me with love
 That never ends.
