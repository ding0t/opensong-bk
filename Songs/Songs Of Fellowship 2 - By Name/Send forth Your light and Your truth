  <lyrics>
[C1]
 Send forth Your light and Your truth,
 Let them guide me,
 Let them bring me to Your holy mountain,
 To the place where You dwell.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 Then I will come to the altar of God,
 My joy and my delight;
 Then I will offer the whole of my life,
 A living sacrifice.
[V2]
 Jesus, the Way and the Truth and the Life,
 My Saviour and my Lord;
 Knowing Your presence will be my delight,
 Your glory my reward. 
[C2]
 Send forth Your light and Your truth,
 Let them guide me,
 Let them bring me to Your holy mountain,
 To the place where You dwell.
 (Repeat)
 O Lord.
