  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Clap your hands, all you nations,
 Shout to God with cries of joy,
 O how awesome is the Lord most high,
 The King over all the earth!
[V2]
 He subdued nations under us,
 The peoples under our feet,
 And He chose our inheritance for us,
 The pride of Jacob, whom He loved.
[V3]
 Now our God has ascended
 In the midst of shouts of joy,
 And the Lord is in among the trumpet sound,
 Among the trumpet sound.
[C]
 Sing praise to God,
 Sing praises to the King,
 Sing praises to the King.
 (Repeat)
[V4]
 For our God is King of all the earth,
 Sing Him a psalm of praise,
 For He rules above the nations on His throne,
 On His holy throne.
[V5]
 All the people are gathered
 Of the God of Abraham.
 For the kings of all the earth belong to God,
 And He is lifted high!
