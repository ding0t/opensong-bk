  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Our God is awesome in power,
 Scatters His enemies;
 Our God is mighty in bringing
 The powerful to their knees.
 He has put on His armour,
 He is prepared for war;
 Mercy and justice triumph
 When the Lion of Judah roars.
[C]
 The Lord is a warrior,
 We will march with Him.
 The Lord is a warrior,
 Leading us to win.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Waken the warrior spirit,
 Army of God, arise;
 Challenge the powers of darkness,
 There must be no compromise.
 We shall attack their strongholds,
 Our hands are trained for war;
 We shall advance the kingdom,
 For the victory belongs to God.
