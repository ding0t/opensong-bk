[V1]
 The king of love is my delight,
 His eyes are fire, His face is light,
 The First and Last, the Living One,
 His name is Jesus.
 And from His mouth there comes a sound
 That shakes the earth and splits the ground,
 And yet this voice is life to me,
 The voice of Jesus.
[C]
 And I will sing my songs of love,
 Calling out across the earth;
 The King has come,
 The King of love has come.
 And troubled minds can know His peace,
 Captive hearts can be released;
 The King has come,
 The King of love has come.
[V2]
 My Lover's breath is sweetest wine,
 I am His prize, and He is mine;
 How can a sinner know such joy?
 Because of Jesus.
 The wounds of love are in His hands,
 The price is paid for sinful man;
 Accepted child, forgiven son,
 Because of Jesus.
[B]
 And my desire is to have You near;
 Lord, You know that You are welcome here.
 Before such love, before such grace
 I will let the walls come down.
