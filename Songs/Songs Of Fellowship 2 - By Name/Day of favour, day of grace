[V1]
 Day of favour, day of grace;
 This is the day of jubilee.
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord
 Is falling now on me.
 Let the oil from heaven flow
 From the presence of the King.
 ||Jesus, let Your power flow
 As we worship, as we sing.
 Set us free to make You known
 To a world that's full of shame.
 Jesus, let Your glory fall,
 Give us power to speak Your name.
[V2]
 Day of favour, day of grace;
 This is the day of jubilee.
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord
 Is falling now on me.
 Open wide the prison doors,
 Where satan's held the key.
 ||Bring deliverance to the bound,
 And set the captives free.
 Bring the good news to the poor,
 And cause the blind to see.
 The Spirit of the Lord
 Is falling now on me.
