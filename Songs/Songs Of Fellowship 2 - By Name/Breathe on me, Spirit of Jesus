[V1]
 Breathe on me, Spirit of Jesus.
 Breathe on me, Holy Spirit of God.
[V2]
 Fill me again, Spirit of Jesus.
 Fill me again, Holy Spirit of God.
[V3]
 Change my heart, Spirit of Jesus.
 Change my heart, Holy Spirit of God.
[V4]
 Bring peace to the world, Spirit of Jesus.
 Bring peace to the world, Holy Spirit of God.
