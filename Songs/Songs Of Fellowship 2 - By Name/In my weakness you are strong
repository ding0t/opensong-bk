  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In my weakness you are strong,
 When I fall short You carry me along.
 Into my darkness You shine Your light,
 When I feel blinded, You restore my sight.
[C]
 You are the Lord, You never change,
 You still the storm when I call Your name.
 You're all I want, You're always there,
 No matter when, no matter where.
 You're the Lord, You never change.
 You're the Lord, You never change.
[V2]
 I'm inconsistent, but You are true;
 I don't trust myself, but I depend on You.
 Look through my selfishness, and see my heart;
 Bring out the precious from the worthless parts.
[V3]
 I need courage, Lord, to make a change;
 It's time my independence got rearranged.
 I'm tired of chasing after my own ways;
 So I'll serve You, Lord,
 Serve You, Lord, serve You, Lord,
 For the rest, rest of my days.
