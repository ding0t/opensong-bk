  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Here we stand in total surrender,
 Lifting our voices, abandoned to Your cause.
 Here we stand, praying in the glory
 Of the one and only Jesus Christ, the Lord.
[C]
 This time revival!
 Lord, come and heal our land;
 Bring to completion
 The work that You've begun.
 This time revival!
 Stir up Your church again,
 Pour out Your Spirit
 On Your daughters and Your sons.
[V2]
 Here we stand in need of Your mercy;
 Father, forgive us for the time that we have lost.
 Once again make us an army
 To conquer this nation with the message of the cross.
