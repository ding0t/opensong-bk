  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In mystery reigning, king over all,
 Hear angels proclaiming, Jesus is Lord.
 To each generation Your love is the same;
 Wonderful Saviour, we worship Your name.
[V2]
 A beauty that's timeless, who can compare?
 All earth stands in silence, when You appear.
 Your kingdom is boundless, Your love without end;
 Wonder of wonders, this King is my friend!
[V3]
 All power has been given into Your hands;
 Through blood and by suffering You now command.
 And no opposition can stand in Your light;
 Crowned King of heaven, we kneel at the sight.
