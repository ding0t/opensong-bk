[V1]
 It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
 To remember all He has done;
 Then God will remember our praises
 When He looks with love on His people.
[C]
 O give thanks to the Lord,
 For His love endures forever.
 O give thanks to the Lord,
 For the Lord alone is good.
[V2]
 Our sin is the sin of our fathers,
 We have done wrong, we all have been evil;
 Like those who once lived in bondage,
 We paid no heed to all You had done.
[V3]
 Our fathers forsook Your love,
 At the Red Sea they questioned their God;
 They fell from their faith in the desert,
 And put God to the test in the wilderness.
[V4]
 Time after time He would rescue them,
 Yet in malice they dared to defy Him;
 Despite this He came to their aid
 When He heard their cries of distress.
[V5]
 Save us, O Lord, in Your love;
 Bring us back from all that offends You.
 Look not alone at our sins,
 But remember your promise of mercy.
[V6]
 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
 Both now and through all eternity;
 Let nations and people cry out
 And sing Amen! Alleluia!
