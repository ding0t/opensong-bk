[V1]
 Beauty for brokenness,
 Hope for despair,
 Lord, in Your suffering world
 This is our prayer:
 Bread for the children,
 Justice, joy, peace;
 Sunrise to sunset,
 Your kingdom increase!
[V2]
 Shelter for fragile lives,
 Cures for their ills,
 Work for the craftsman,
 Trade for their skills;
 Land for the dispossessed,
 Rights for the weak,
 Voices to plead the cause
 Of those who can't speak.
[C]
 God of the poor,
 Friend of the weak,
 Give us compassion we pray:
 Melt our cold hearts,
 Let tears fall like rain;
 Come, change our love
 From a spark to a flame.
[V3]
 Refuge from cruel wars,
 Havens from fear,
 Cities for sanctuary,
 Freedoms to share;
 Peace to the killing-fields,
 Scorched earth to green,
 Christ for the bitterness,
 His cross for the pain.
[V4]
 Rest for the ravaged earth,
 Oceans and streams
 Plundered and poisoned -
 Our future, our dreams.
 Lord, end our madness,
 Carelessness, greed;
 Make us content with
 The things that we need.
[V5]
 Lighten our darkness,
 Breathe on this flame
 Until Your justice
 Burns brightly again;
 Until the nations
 Learn of Your ways,
 Seek Your salvation
 And bring You their praise.
