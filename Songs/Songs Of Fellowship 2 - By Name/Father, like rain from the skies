  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father, like rain from the skies,
 Send Your word into our lives.
 We cry out: 'Show us Your way,
 Come to us, Father, we pray.'
[C]
 Come and satisfy,
 Come and satisfy my soul.
 Come and satisfy,
 Come and satisfy my soul
 And make me whole.
[V2]
 When will our hearts understand,
 You have our lives in Your hand?
 We cry out: 'Come to us, Lord,
 Guide us we pray with Your word.'
