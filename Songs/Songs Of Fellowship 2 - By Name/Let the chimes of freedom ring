[V1]
 Let the chimes of freedom ring
 All across this earth;
 Lift your voice in praise to Him
 And sing of all His worth,
 And sing of all His worth.
[V2]
 Open wide your prison doors
 To greet the Lord of life;
 Songs of triumph fill the air,
 Christ Jesus is alive,
 Christ Jesus is alive.
[C1]
 Let all the people hear the news
 Of the One who comes to save:
 He's the Lord of all the universe,
 And forever He shall reign.
 And forever more, yes forever more,
 And forever more He will reign.
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 In every corner of this earth,
 To every tribe and tongue,
 Make known that God so loved this world
 That He gave His only Son,
 He gave His only Son.
[V4]
 Spread the news and make it plain,
 He breaks the power of sin;
 Jesus died and He rose again,
 His love will never end,
 His love will never end.
[V5]
 He will return in majesty
 To take His rightful place
 As the King of all eternity,
 The Name above all names,
 The Name above all names.
