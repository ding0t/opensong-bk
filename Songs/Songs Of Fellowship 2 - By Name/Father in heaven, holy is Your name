  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father in heaven, holy is Your name.
 Your kingdom come, Your will be done,
 Let it be the same.
 (Repeat)
 ||On earth as it is in heaven,
 On earth as it is in heaven.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Give us today all our daily bread,
 As we forgive our debtors,
 So You forgive our debts.
 (Repeat)
 ||And lead us not into temptation;
 Deliver us from evil.
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 For Yours is the kingdom,
 The power and the glory,
 Forever and ever and ever, amen.
 (Repeat)
