  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My heart,
 I want to give You my heart,
 In service to the Lord, the One who cares
 To ask for my life.
 ||Take me,
 Mould my life and make me
 Into a child who longs to stay by Your side
 And learn of Your ways.
[V2]
 For when I sought You, Lord, You heard me,
 You delivered me from fear;
 And by Your grace and mercy
 You have brought us both so near.
 ||I want to kneel before Your feet, Lord,
 And to gaze upon Your face;
 For the God who asks for my life
 Loves me completely and always.
