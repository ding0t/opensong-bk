[V1]
 We are Your inheritance,
 We are Your reward.
 (Repeat)
 And You're our glory
 And the lifter of our heads;
 You're our glory
 And the lifter of our heads.
[V2]
 Listen, can you hear it?
 The Spirit and the Bride.
 (Repeat)
 Whisper 'Jesus!
 Maranatha! Come!'
 Whisper 'Jesus!
 Maranatha! Come!'
[V3]
 O come, O come to us!
 O come, O come to us!
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
 O come, O come to us!
