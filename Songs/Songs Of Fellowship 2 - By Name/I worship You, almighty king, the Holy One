  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I worship You, almighty king, the Holy One,
 For You alone have filled me with new life.
 My greatest Friend, You've redeemed my soul;
 You've won my heart with Your great love.
[V2]
 I have tasted of Your goodness
 And I've heard of Your fame,
 So we enter into Your presence
 To praise Your holy name.
[C]
 We lift our voice and sing,
 There's an extravagant praise
 That fills our hearts,
 For You are Lord and King
 And we bless Your name.
 ||We dance for joy and bring
 Our adoration to our faithful God,
 To You our everything,
 We bring extravagant praise.
 Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah.
 Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah.
[V3]
 You've called me, Lord, to live for You in holiness,
 I've been made clean and chosen as Your son.
 Through Jesus Christ You've made me whole,
 My heart is filled with love for You.
