[C]
 I want to be holy,
 I want to be righteous,
 I want to live my life the way You want me to.
 I want to be blameless,
 Not walking in darkness,
 I want to be a living sacrifice to You.
[V1]
 I'm gonna run the race,
 I'm gonna run to win,
 Throw off everything that hinders me.
 I'm gonna fix my eyes upon the King,
 And leave my sin behind.
[V2]
 I want to be so much better,
 I want to be more like You.
 Keep taking me further and deeper,
 I want to right the wrong,
 I want to live this song,
 Now I'm pressing on,
 I'm gonna leave my sin behind.
[V3]
 Singing, 'goodbye rage, goodbye hate,
 Goodbye anger, goodbye malice,
 Goodbye bitterness and slander,
 Goodbye fear of man!'
 (Repeat)
