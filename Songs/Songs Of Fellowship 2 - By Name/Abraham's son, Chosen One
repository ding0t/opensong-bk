[V1]
 Abraham's son, Chosen One,
 Zion's cornerstone;
 Passover Lamb, Son of Man,
 Seated upon Your throne.
[C]
 Hail to the King,
 Hail to the King,
 Hail to the King of kings.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 O promised Seed, beneath Your feet
 Sin and death shall fall.
 Now through us tread the serpent's head
 Till You are all in all.
[V3]
 The world's yet to see Your glory,
 But You'll be revealed in power,
 And You will reign with the Bride ordained
 For Your consummating hour.
