[V1]
 New covenant people rejoice,
 Lift up your eyes and see your King.
 Reigning in power on His heavenly throne,
 Angels are joyfully singing:
[C]
 To the Father, our Creator,
 To our Judge and Lord.
 And to Jesus, Mediator,
 Who has cleansed us in His blood.
[V2]
 Let us through Jesus draw near to God,
 Offering up our sacrifice,
 Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all,
 Joining with heavenly praises:
[V3]
 We give thanks to You with fear,
 Holy God, consuming fire,
 Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all,
 We bring our love and devotion:
