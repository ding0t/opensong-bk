[V1]
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
 Jesus, I will never let You go: 
 You've taken me from the miry clay,
 You've set my feet upon the rock and now I know:
[V2]
 I love You, I need You,
 Though my world will fall,
 I'll never let You go;
 My Saviour, my closest Friend,
 I will worship You until the very end.
