  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O Lord I want to sing Your praises,
 I want to praise Your name every day.
 O Lord I want to sing Your praises,
 I want to praise Your name every day.
[C]
 Alleluia, allelu.
 Alleluia, allelu.
 (Alleluia.)
[V2]
 God, You are my God, and I will seek You;
 I am satisfied when I find Your love.
 God, You are my God, and I will seek You;
 I am satisfied when I find Your love.
[V3]
 And I will praise You as long as I live,
 For Your love is better than life.
 In Your name I will lift up my hands,
 For Your love is better than life.
