  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You came to heal the brokenhearted;
 You came to make the blind eyes see.
 Your light is burning now within us,
 As Your word of truth sets us free.
[C]
 And we will fill the earth with the love of God
 That's been shed abroad in our hearts,
 Share with every nation and every land
 The grace that He imparts.
 ||And we will sing a new song of joy and peace,
 A resounding trumpet call,
 Causing hearts to rise, opening eyes to see
 That Jesus, Jesus is Lord of all.
[V2]
 You come in all Your mighty power,
 You come to bring the latter rain;
 We know You've filled us with Your Spirit
 And a love we cannot contain.
[V3]
 You'll come in glory and splendour,
 You'll come to reign upon the earth;
 We know we'll live with You forever
 And declare Your mighty worth.
