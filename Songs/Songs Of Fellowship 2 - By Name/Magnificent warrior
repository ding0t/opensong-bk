  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Magnificent warrior, arrayed for battle,
 We see You ready to slay Your enemies.
 O Mighty Captain of heaven's armies,
 We bow before You, we worship You.
[C]
 So take Your sword upon Your side
 O Mighty One, clothe Yourself
 With splendour and with majesty,
 And in Your majesty ride forth.
 Ride forth victoriously for truth.
 Humility and righteousness.
 Let Your strong right hand
 Display Your awesome deeds.
[V2]
 Magnificent Warrior, we hear Your strong command
 To join the ranks of light and march into the fight;
 By faith to overthrow ten thousand Jerichos,
 To make Your judgements known in all the earth.
