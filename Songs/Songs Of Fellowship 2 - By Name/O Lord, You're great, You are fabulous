[V1]
 O Lord, You're great, You are fabulous,
 We love You more than any words can sing, sing, sing.
 O Lord, You're great, You are so generous,
 You lavish us with gifts when we don't deserve a thing.
[C]
 Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord.
 Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
 Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
 Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord.
 Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
 Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
[V2]
 O Lord, You're great, You are so powerful,
 You hold the mighty universe in Your hand, hand, hand.
 O Lord, You're great, You are so beautiful,
 You've poured out Your love on this undeserving land.
