  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O God, be my strength
 Through my doubt and my fear.
 O God, be my comfort
 When darkness is near.
 O Lord of all hope,
 You're my Saviour and Guide.
 O Lord, have mercy on me.
[V2]
 O God of all mercy
 And God of all grace,
 Whose infinite gift
 Was to die in my place,
 Eternal Creator,
 Redeemer and Friend,
 O Lord, have mercy on me.
[V3]
 O God of all power,
 Invisible King,
 Restorer of man,
 My life I bring,
 O Lord of my heart,
 Grant Your peace now I pray:
 O Lord, have mercy on me.
