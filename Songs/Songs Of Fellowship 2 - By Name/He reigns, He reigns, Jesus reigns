[C]
 He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
 He reigns enthroned in majesty.
 Shout your praise, His banners raise,
 For Jesus reigns.
 Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.
[V1]
 Our highest praise we bring
 To our great eternal King.
 His glory fills the skies,
 Now from earth let praise arise.
[V2]
 He spoiled the hosts of hell,
 And like blazing stars, they fell.
 He led them forth in chains -
 Now our mighty Victor reigns!
