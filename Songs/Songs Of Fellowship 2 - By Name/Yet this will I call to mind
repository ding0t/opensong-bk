[V1]
 Yet this will I call to mind,
 And therefore I will hope,
 Because of the Lord's great love
 I've been redeemed.
 The Lord is gracious and kind
 To all who call on His name,
 Because of the Lord's great love
 I've been redeemed.
[C]
 Because of the Lord's great love,
 Because of the Lord's great love,
 Because of the Lord's great love
 I've been redeemed.
[V2]
 I know of His steadfast love,
 His mercy renewed each day,
 Because of the Lord's great love
 I've been redeemed.
 Washed in the blood of the Lamb,
 Guiltless for ever I stand,
 Because of the Lord's great love
 I've been redeemed.
