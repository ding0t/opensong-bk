  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are righteous in all Your ways,
 You are good, You are good.
 You are truthful in all You say,
 You are good, You are good.
[V2]
 And I bow my knee before You,
 In honour of Your name,
 For You alone are worthy,
 Worthy of my praise,
 Worthy of my praise.
[V3]
 You are holy, faithful and true,
 You are good, You are good.
 You are gracious in all You do,
 You are good, You are good.
