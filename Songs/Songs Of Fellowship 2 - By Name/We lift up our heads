  <lyrics>
[C]
 We lift up our heads,
 And we will sing our praise
 To Him who sits on the throne.
 We lift up our heads
 To the King of kings,
 Who reigns in heaven and earth.
[V1]
 Holy and mighty,
 Awesome in power,
 Full of compassion
 And love.
[V2]
 Glorious in holiness,
 Fearful in praises,
 Working His wonders
 In us.
