  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I need You like dew in the desert,
 Like refreshing summer rain,
 Come and pour Your love again on me.
 I'm finding that every time I come
 And ask for something more,
 You never fail to pour Your love on me.
[V2]
 And peace like a river flows,
 Waves of mercy ever roll;
 Take me deeper,
 I want to know You more.
 Pour Your love, pour Your love,
 Pour Your love on me.
