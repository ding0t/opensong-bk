[V1]
 He picked me up
 And He dusted me down,
 Put my feet back on solid ground.
 He welcomed me home
 And He caused me to sing,
 I'm in love, I'm in love with the King.
[V2]
 For all my days I'll sing His praise,
 I'm so grateful.
 Yes, I will give my everything
 To the One who sets me free.
[V3]
 Once I was lost, but now I'm found,
 Yes, He saved me.
 He called my name and my life was changed
 By the power of His love.
