  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My heart is not raised up too high,
 My eyes don't search beyond the sky.
 I do not seek what can't be known,
 Nor fret myself over mysteries.
[V2]
 But I have calmed and soothed my soul,
 Like a child at rest in its mother's arms;
 Like this child sleeping by my side,
 My soul, in God, knows peace and calm.
[V3]
 All you who love and trust your God,
 In this God shall you put your hope,
 For there you'll find unfailing love,
 From this time forth, and forever more.
