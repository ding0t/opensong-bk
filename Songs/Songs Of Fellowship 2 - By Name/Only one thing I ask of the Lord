[V1]
 Only one thing I ask of the Lord:
 Only one thing do I desire:
 That I may dwell, may dwell in God's house
 All of the days of my life,
 All of the days of my life.
[V2]
 Even when days of trouble may come,
 I will be safe if God is my home,
 For I will hide in the shelter of love
 All of the days of my life,
 All of the days of my life.
[V3]
 I'll gaze on His beauty,
 And sing of His glory;
 While I have life within me,
 What more could I need?
[V4]
 (Descant)
 I'll sing to His holy name,
 Forever He is the same,
 His faithfulness never change,
 Let all of the earth proclaim,
 All of the days of my life.
