[V1]
 I see the Lord
 Seated on the throne, exalted:
 And the train of His robe
 Fills the temple with glory:
 The whole earth is filled,
 The whole earth is filled,
 The whole earth is filled
 With Your glory.
[V2]
 Holy, holy,
 Holy, holy,
 Yes, holy is the Lord.
 Holy, holy,
 Holy, holy,
 Yes, holy is the Lord of Lords.
