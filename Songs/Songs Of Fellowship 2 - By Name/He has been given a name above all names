  <lyrics>
[V1]
 He has been given a name above all names,
 In earth and heaven, let all creation claim
 That Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.
 || He is the Victor over satan's reign,
 His blood has triumphed over sin and shame,
 Jesus Christ is King and Lord of all.
[V2]
 He is the likeness of Jehovah,
 Through whom the world was made.
 By His word the universe is sustained,
 Every power is subject to His name.
 || The name of Jesus in victory will resound,
 In every nation let the good news sound:
 Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.
