[V1]
 He brought me to His banqueting table, (Men-Women echo)
 He brought me to His banqueting table, (Men-Women echo)
 And His banner over me is love. (All)
[V2]
 I am my Beloved's and He is mine, (Men-Women echo)
 I am my Beloved's and He is mine, (Men-Women echo)
 And His banner over me is love. (All)
 Yes, His banner over me is love.
[V3]
 And we can feel the love of God in this place,
 We believe Your goodness, we receive Your grace.
 We delight ourselves at Your table, O God,
 You do all things well, just look at our lives.
