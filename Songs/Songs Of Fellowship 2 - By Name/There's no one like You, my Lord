  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one could take Your place;
 My heart beats to worship You,
 I live just to seek Your face.
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one could take Your place;
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one like You.
[C]
 You are my God,
 You're everything to me;
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one like You.
 You are my God.
 You're everything to me;
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one like You.
[V2]
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one could take Your place;
 I long for Your presence, Lord,
 To serve You is my reward.
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one could take Your place;
 There's no one like You, my Lord,
 No one like You.
