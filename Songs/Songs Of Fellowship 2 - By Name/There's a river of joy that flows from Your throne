  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There's a river of joy that flows from Your throne,
 O river of joy flow through me.
 There's a river of joy that flows from Your throne:
 Come, Holy Spirit, with joy,
 Come, Holy Spirit, with joy.
[V2]
 I will rise up on the wings of an eagle;
 With joy I receive Your love.
 I will praise You with a song everlasting.
 Thank You, Lord, for Your love.
 Thank You, Lord, for Your love.
