[V1]
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon you,
 Because He has anointed you
 To preach good news.
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon you,
 Because He has anointed you
 To preach good news.
[V2]
 He has sent you to the poor, (Men)
 This is the year: (Women)
 To bind up the brokenhearted, (Men)
 This is the day: (Women)
 To bring freedom to the captives, (Men)
 This is the year: (Women)
 And to release the ones in darkness. (All)
[C]
 This is the year of the favour of the Lord.
 This is the day of the vengeance of our God.
 This is the year of the favour of the Lord.
 This is the day of the vengeance of our God.
[V3]
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,
 Because He has anointed us
 To preach good news.
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,
 Because He has anointed us
 To preach good news.
[V4]
 He will comfort all who mourn (Men)
 This is the year: (Women)
 He will provide for those who grieve; (Men)
 This is the day: (Women)
 He will pour out the oil of gladness, (Men)
 This is the year: (Women)
 Instead of mourning you will praise. (All)
