[V1]
 I will worship (I will worship)
 With all of my heart. (with all of my heart)
 I will praise You (I will praise You)
 With all of my strength. (all my strength)
 ||I will seek You (I will seek You)
 All of my days. (all of my days)
 I will follow (I will follow)
 All of Your ways. (all Your ways)
[C]
 I will give You all my worship,
 I will give You all my praise.
 You alone I long to worship,
 You alone are worthy of my praise.
[V2]
 I will bow down, (I will bow down)
 Hail You as King. (hail You as King)
 I will serve You, (I will serve You)
 Give You everything. (give You everything)
 ||I will lift up (I will lift up)
 My eyes to Your throne, (my eyes to Your throne)
 I will trust You, (I will trust You)
 I will trust You alone. (trust You alone)
