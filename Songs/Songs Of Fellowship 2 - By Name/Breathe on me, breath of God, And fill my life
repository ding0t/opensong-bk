  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Breathe on me, breath of God,
 And fill my life anew;
 That I may love as You love,
 And do the works that You do.
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
[V2]
 Breathe on me, breath of God,
 Until my heart is pure;
 Until my will is one with Yours
 Let holiness and love endure.
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
[V3]
 And let every part of me
 Glow with fire divine;
 With passion in my life,
 Jesus, let Your glory shine.
 (Repeat)
