[V1]
 Holy one, my life is in Your hand;
 My song an offering of my heart,
 Redeemed, washed clean,
 By faith I stand secure.
 In You, Jesus, I live.
[V2]
 To You the glory, to You the power,
 To You the honour forever more.
 Your love brings healing,
 Your love's eternal,
 Your love's the answer,
 The hope of the world,
 The hope of the world.
