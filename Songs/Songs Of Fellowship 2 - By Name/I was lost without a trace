  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I was lost without a trace,
 All except for the eyes of heaven.
 Now my Saviour's love has found me,
 And His love has brought me home.
[V2]
 I can sleep in peace tonight,
 I won't worry about tomorrow,
 Now I know my Daddy loves me,
 And His perfect love will conquer all.
[C]
 I'm like a child in His eyes,
 And He will meet my needs
 With all the riches of heaven;
 And He loves me much too much
 To let me go,
 He will keep me in His love.
[V3]
 Heaven and earth may pass away,
 And mountains fall into the ocean;
 But His word is everlasting,
 And His love goes on and on.
