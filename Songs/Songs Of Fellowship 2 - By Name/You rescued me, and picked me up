  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You rescued me, and picked me up,
 A living hope of grace revealed,
 A life transformed in righteousness,
 O Lord You have rescued me.
 Forgiving me, You healed my heart,
 And set me free from sin and death.
 You brought me life, You made me whole,
 O Lord, You have rescued me.
[V2]
 And You loved me before I knew You,
 And You knew me for all time.
 I've been created in Your image,
 O Lord.
 ||And You bought me, and You sought me,
 Your blood poured out for me;
 A new creation in Your image,
 O Lord.
 You rescued me, You rescued me.
