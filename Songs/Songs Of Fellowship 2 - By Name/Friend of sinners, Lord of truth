  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Friend of sinners, Lord of truth,
 I am falling in love with You.
 Friend of sinners, Lord of truth,
 I have fallen in love with You.
[C]
 Jesus, I love Your name,
 The name by which we're saved.
 Jesus, I love Your name,
 The name by which we're saved.
[V2]
 Friend of sinners, Lord of truth,
 I am giving my life to You.
 Friend of sinners, Lord of truth,
 I have given my life to You.
