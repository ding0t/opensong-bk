  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Like a candle flame,
 Flickering small in our darkness.
 Uncreated light
 Shines through infant eyes.
[C]
 God is with us, alleluia. (Men)
 God is with us, alleluia. (Women)
 Come to save us, alleluia. (Men)
 Come to save us, (Women)
 Alleluia! (All).
[V2]
 Stars and angels sing,
 Yet the earth sleeps in shadows;
 Can this tiny spark
 Set a world on fire?
[V3]
 Yet His light shall shine
 From our lives, Spirit blazing,
 As we touch the flame
 Of His holy fire.
