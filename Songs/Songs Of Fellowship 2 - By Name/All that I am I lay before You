  <lyrics>
[C]
 All that I am I lay before You;
 All I possess, Lord, I confess
 Is nothing without You.
 Saviour and King, I now enthrone You;
 Take my life, my living sacrifice to You.
[V1]
 Lord, be the strength within my weakness;
 Be the supply in every need,
 That I may prove Your promises to me,
 Faithful and true in word and deed.
[V2]
 Into Your hands I place the future;
 The past is nailed to Calvary,
 That I may live in resurrection power,
 No longer I but Christ in me.
