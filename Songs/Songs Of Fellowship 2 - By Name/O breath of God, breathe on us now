[V1]
 O breath of God, breathe on us now,
 And move within us while we pray;
 The Spring of our new life art Thou,
 The very light of our new day.
[V2]
 O strangely art Thou with us, Lord,
 Neither in height nor depth to seek:
 In nearness shall Thy voice be heard;
 Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.
[V3]
 Christ is our Advocate on high;
 Thou art our Advocate within.
 O plead the truth, and make reply
 To every argument of sin.
[V4]
 But ah, this faithless heart of mine,
 The way I know, I know my Guide;
 Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
 That I so often turn aside.
[V5]
 Be with me when no other friend
 The mystery of my heart can share;
 And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
 By Thy best name of Comforter.
