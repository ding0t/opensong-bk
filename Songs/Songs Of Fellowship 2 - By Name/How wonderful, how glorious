[C]
 How wonderful, how glorious
 Is the love of God,
 Bringing healing, forgiveness,
 Wonderful love.
[V1]
 Let celebration echo through this land;
 We bring reconciliation,
 We bring hope to every man:
[V2]
 We proclaim the kingdom
 Of our God is here;
 Come and join the heavenly anthem,
 Ringing loud and ringing clear:
[V3]
 Listen to the music
 As His praises fill the air;
 With joy and with gladness
 Tell the people everywhere:
