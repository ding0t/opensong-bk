  <lyrics>
[C]
 Power from on high,
 Power from on high,
 Lord, we are waiting
 For power from on high.
 Power from on high,
 Power from on high,
 Lord, we are waiting
 For power from on high.
[V1]
 May we taste Your heaven
 Here on the earth,
 May Your Spirit bring us new birth.
[V2]
 May we take Your heaven
 To those on the earth,
 May Your Spirit bring them new birth.
[V3]
 May the truth and power
 Of life that You give
 Very soon be ours to live.
