[V1]
 I will extol the Lord with all my heart.
 I will extol the Lord with all my heart,
 For holy and awesome,
 For holy and awesome,
 For holy and awesome is His name.
[V2]
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 And the fear of the Lord
 Is the start of wisdom.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
[V3]
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Those who follow His ways
 Have a good understanding.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
[V4]
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 And to Him belong eternal praise.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
 Holy and awesome is His name.
