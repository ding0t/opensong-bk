  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We have a vision for this nation;
 We share a dream for this land.
 We join with angels in celebration,
 By faith we speak revival to this land.
[V2]
 Where every knee shall bow and worship You,
 And every tongue confess that You are Lord;
 Give us an open heaven, anoint our prayers this day,
 And move Your sovereign hand across this nation.
