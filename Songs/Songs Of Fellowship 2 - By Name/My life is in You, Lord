  <lyrics>
[C1]
 My life is in You, Lord,
 My strength is in You, Lord,
 My hope is in You, Lord,
 In You, it's in You.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 I will praise You with all of my life;
 I will praise You with all of my strength.
 With all of my life,
 With all of my strength;
 All of my hope is in You. 
[C2]
 My life is in You, Lord,
 My strength is in You, Lord,
 My hope is in You, Lord,
 In You, it's in You.
 (Repeat)
 |In You.
