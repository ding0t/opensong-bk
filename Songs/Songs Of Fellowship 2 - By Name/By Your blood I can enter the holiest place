[V1]
 By Your blood I can enter the holiest place,
 To the throne of my Father and King.
 There I find Your acceptance, mercy and grace,
 And my life is renewed again.
[V2]
 Far away from the stress and the turmoil of life,
 I now come to seek Your face.
 In the house of the Lord where Your presence is found,
 I now come to worship You.
[C]
 I see the King upon the throne,
 Jesus, full of majesty.
 I will fall down at Your feet,
 I will worship You alone.
[V3]
 In the light of Your presence I find deepest joy,
 There is no other place I would be.
 To behold Your beauty is all my desire,
 You're the one my heart longs for,
 You're the one my heart longs for.
