[V1]
 Love songs from heaven are filling the earth,
 Bringing great hope to all nations.
 Evil has prospered, but truth is alive;
 In this dark world the light still shines.
[V2]
 Nothing has silenced this gospel of Christ;
 It echoes down through the ages.
 Blood of the martyrs has made Your church strong;
 In this dark world the light still shines.
[C]
 For You we live,
 And for You we may die;
 Through us may Jesus be seen.
 For You alone we will offer our lives;
 In this dark world our light will shine.
[V3]
 Let every nation be filled with Your song:
 This is the cry of Your people.
 We will not settle for anything less,
 In this dark world our light must shine.
