[V1]
 Let us go up to the house of God
 With a shout of praise,
 With a song of celebration.
 We'll ascend the hill of the Lord,
 We can stand in the holy place.
[V2]
 We can have clean hands and a pure heart;
 His blood can cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.
 He has made a way though the cross;
 Jesus' blood was shed for us.
 We can draw near to our God.
[V3]
 Now His body has been broken,
 And the curtain torn in two.
 We can enter by a new and living way
 Before His throne.
 Yes, we can fellowship with Him,
 The King of glory, King of kings.
