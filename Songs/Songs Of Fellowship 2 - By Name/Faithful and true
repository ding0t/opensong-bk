[V1]
 Faithful and true
 Are all Your ways;
 Your love for me will never fade away.
 Always the same,
 You never change;
 Your love for me will never fade away.
[V2]
 Even in my hour of deepest need,
 You are always there to walk with me.
 You know my words before I speak;
 Lord, I know that You will never forsake me.
