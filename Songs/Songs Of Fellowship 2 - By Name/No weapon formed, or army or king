  <lyrics>
[V1]
 No weapon formed, or army or king,
 Shall be able to stand
 Against the Lord and His anointed.
 No weapon formed, or army or king,
 Shall be able to stand
 Against the Lord and His anointed.
[V2]
 All principalities and powers
 Shall crumble before the Lord;
 And men's hearts shall be released,
 And they shall come unto the Lord.
[V3]
 No weapon formed, or army or king,
 Shall be able to stand
 Against the Lord and His anointed.
