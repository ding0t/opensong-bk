[V1]
 I just want to be where You are,
 Dwelling daily in Your presence.
 I don't want to worship from afar,
 Draw me near to where You are.
 I just want to be where You are,
 In Your dwelling place forever.
 Take me to the place where You are,
 I just want to be with You.
[C]
 I want to be where You are,
 Dwelling in You presence,
 Feasting at Your table,
 Surrounded by Your glory.
 In Your presence,
 That's where I always want to be,
 I just want to be,
 I just want to be with You.
[V2]
 O my God, You are my strength and my song,
 And when I'm in Your presence,
 Though I'm weak, You're always strong.
