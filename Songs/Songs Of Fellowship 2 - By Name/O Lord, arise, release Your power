  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O Lord, arise, release Your power,
 Scatter Your foes this very hour.
 May we hold on to Your holy commands.
 You are the Lord of every man.
[V2]
 You hold our lives, You give us breath,
 You freed us from the power of death.
 You're our salvation, our only hope,
 You are the Lord of every man.
[V3]
 Your voice, it is like thunder
 Over the waters.
 Your voice echoes throughout the earth,
 We will bow to the sound,
 We will bow to the sound
 Of Your voice.
