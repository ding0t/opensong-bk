  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Your love looks after me,
 It never fails.
 Your word takes care of me,
 And keeps my mind on You.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 You are majestic
 Through all the earth;
 I am Your servant
 For the rest of my days.
[V3]
 You are magnificent,
 The God of glory;
 I'm going to worship You
 For the rest of my days,
 For the rest of my days,
 For the rest of my days.
