[V1]
 I have come to love You,
 I have come to love You today.
 I have come to love You,
 I have come to love You today.
[C]
 And today and forever more
 I'll love Your name.
 And today and forever more
 I'll love Your name.
[V2]
 I have come to worship,
 I have come to worship today.
 I have come to worship,
 I have come to worship today.
[V3]
 I have come to thank You,
 I have come to thank You today.
 I have come to thank You,
 I have come to thank You today.
