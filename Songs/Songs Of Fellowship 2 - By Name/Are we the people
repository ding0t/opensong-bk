  <lyrics>
[C]
 Are we the people
 Who will see God's kingdom come,
 When He is known in every nation?
 One thing is certain,
 We are closer than before;
 Keep moving on, last generation.
[V1]
 These are the days for harvest,
 To gather in the lost;
 Let those who live in darkness
 Hear the message of the cross.
[V2]
 We'll go where God is sending,
 We'll do what He commands;
 These years that He has waited
 Could be coming to an end.
