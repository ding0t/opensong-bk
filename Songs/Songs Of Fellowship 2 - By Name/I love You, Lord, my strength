  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I love You, Lord, my strength,
 For You heard my cry.
 You have been my help in trouble.
 I've put my trust in You,
 My refuge and my hope,
 You're the Rock on which I stand.
[C]
 You're my stronghold,
 You're my stronghold,
 You're the stronghold of my life.
 You're my stronghold,
 You're my stronghold,
 You're the stronghold of my life.
[V2]
 I love You, Lord, my strength,
 You reached down from on high,
 And You rescued me from trouble.
 You've taken hold of me,
 And set me on a rock,
 And now this is where I stand.
[V3]
 I love You, Lord, my strength,
 There is no other rock,
 And now I will not be shaken.
 The sea may roar and crash,
 The mountains quake and fall,
 Ah, but on this Rock I stand.
