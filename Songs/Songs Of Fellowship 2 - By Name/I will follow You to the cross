  <lyrics>
[C]
 I will follow You to the cross
 And lay myself down, lay myself down.
 I will follow You to the cross,
 And lay myself down, lay myself down.
[V1]
 Rid me of these dirty clothes,
 Cleanse me from all this pollution.
 I choose to walk in purity,
 Oh, purify me, purify me.
[V2]
 Kiss me with Your healing touch,
 Take me to the heat of the fire;
 Bathe me in Your liquid love,
 Oh, saturate me, saturate me.
[V3]
 Humbly I stand, humbly I kneel,
 Humbly I fall at Your throne.
 With a craving for You
 That no words can describe:
 Saturate me, saturate me;
 Saturate me, saturate me;
 Purify me, purify me;
 Purify me, purify me;
 Purify me, purify me.
