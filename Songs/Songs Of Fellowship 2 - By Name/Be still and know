[V1]
 Be still and know that I am God,
 Be still and know that I am God,
 Be still and know that I am God.
[V2]
 I am the Lord that healeth thee,
 I am the Lord that healeth thee,
 I am the Lord that healeth thee.
[V3]
 In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust,
 In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust,
 In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.
