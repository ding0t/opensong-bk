[V1]
 Praise the Lord,
 All you servants of the Lord,
 Who minister by night within His house.
 Lift up your hands
 Within the sanctuary,
 And praise the Lord.
[V2]
 May the Lord,
 The Maker of heaven and earth,
 May this Lord bless you from Zion;
 Lift up your hands
 Within the sanctuary
 And praise the Lord.
[V3]
 We praise You, Lord,
 We praise You, Lord;
 Hallelujah, we praise You, Lord.
