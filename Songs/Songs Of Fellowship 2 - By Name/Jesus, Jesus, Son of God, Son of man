[V1]
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Son of God, Son of man,
 Friend of sinners, gift of God.
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Light of life, Lord of all,
 Full of grace and truth.
[C]
 You have come to us,
 Your presence has filled this place.
 We will draw near to You,
 We come, Lord, to seek Your face.
[V2]
 Jesus, Jesus,
 My heart aches, my soul waits,
 For Your healing, Lord, I pray.
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Mighty God, holy Child,
 Name above all names.
[V3]
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Son of God, Son of Man,
 My soul thirsts for You.
