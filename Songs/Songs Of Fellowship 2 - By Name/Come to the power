  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Come to the power,
 The power of the living God;
 His name is higher,
 Higher than any other name.
 Mighty Jehovah, awesome Deliverer;
 His power is greater,
 Greater than any principality.
[V2]
 A mighty fortress is our God,
 He sits enthroned in the heavens,
 The Lord of Hosts is He.
 A mighty fortress is our God,
 He sits enthroned in the heavens,
 He reigns in majesty.
 (Repeat)
 In majesty.
