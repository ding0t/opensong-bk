[V1]
 I've fallen in love (I've fallen in love)
 Since the first time we met,
 (Since the first time we met)
 There at the cross where You paid for my sin,
 You opened the way to my heart and came in,
 ||Oh, I've fallen in love, (I've fallen in love)
 Yes, I've fallen in love. (I've fallen in love)
[V2]
 I've fallen in love (I've fallen in love)
 Since the first time we met,
 (Since the first time we met)
 When I finally looked unto You,
 You broke my hardened heart in two,
 ||Oh, I've fallen in love, (I've fallen in love)
 Yes, I've fallen in love. (I've fallen in love.)
[V3]
 Jesus my Lord, only You have my heart,
 Only You can know;
 Words don't express what my heart tries to say,
 That I have fallen in love.
[V4]
 I've fallen in love (I've fallen in love)
 Since the first time we met,
 (Since the first time we met)
 When You stole my love of the world
 And placed my heart's affection on You,
 ||Oh, I've fallen in love, (I've fallen in love)
 Yes, I've fallen in love. (I've fallen in love.)
