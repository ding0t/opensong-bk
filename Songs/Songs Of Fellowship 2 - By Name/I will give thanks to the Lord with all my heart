[V1]
 I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart,
 I will sing glorious praises to Your name;
 I will be glad and exalt in You, my Lord,
 Yesterday, today, forever, You're the same.
[C]
 O Most High,
 You who are my stronghold,
 When troubles come,
 You're my hiding place;
 O Most High,
 Those who know You trust You,
 You will not forsake the ones
 Who seek Your face.
