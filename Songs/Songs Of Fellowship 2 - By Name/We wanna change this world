[C]
 We wanna change this world,
 We wanna change this world.
 We wanna change this world,
 We wanna change this world.
[V1]
 So wave those flags of justice
 Over the nations,
 And hit those drums of peace
 Among the peoples.
 We hear the sound of history in the making,
 Let God's love run around the earth
 And bring freedom!
[V2]
 So hold each other's hands
 Across the oceans,
 And play those chords of peace
 Among the peoples.
 We hear the sound of reconciliation:
 Let God's love dance around the earth
 And bring freedom!
[V3]
 And we wanna change this world
 As we live out holy lives.
 And we wanna change this world
 As You wash our motives clean.
 (Repeat)
 Oh, wash us clean!
