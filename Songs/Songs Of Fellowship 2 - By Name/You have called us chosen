  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You have called us chosen,
 A royal priesthood,
 A holy nation,
 We belong to You.
 (Repeat)
[C]
 Take our lives as a sacrifice;
 Shine in us Your holy light.
 Purify our hearts' desire;
 Be to us a consuming fire.
[V2]
 You have shown us mercy,
 You have redeemed us;
 Our hearts cry 'Father,
 We belong to You.'
 (Repeat)
