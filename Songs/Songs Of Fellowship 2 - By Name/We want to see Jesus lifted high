[V1]
 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
 A banner that flies across this land,
 That all men might see the truth and know
 He is the way to heaven.
 (Repeat)
[C1]
 We want to see, We want to see,
 We want to see Jesus lifted high.
 We want to see, we want to see,
 We want to see Jesus lifted high.
[V2]
 Step by step we're moving forward,
 Little by little taking ground,
 Every prayer a powerful weapon,
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
 And down, and down, and down.
[C2]
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,
 We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,
 We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
