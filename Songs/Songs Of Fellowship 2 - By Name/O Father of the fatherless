  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O Father of the fatherless,
 In whom all families are blessed,
 I love the way You father me.
 You gave me life, forgave the past,
 Now in Your arms I'm safe at last,
 I love the way You father me.
[C]
 Father me, forever You'll father me,
 And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure.
 I love the way You father me.
 I love the way You father me.
[V2]
 When bruised and broken I draw near
 You hold me close and dry my tears,
 I love the way You father me.
 At last my fearful heart is still,
 Surrendered to Your perfect will,
 I love the way You father me.
[V3]
 If in my foolishness I stray,
 Returning empty and ashamed,
 I love the way You father me.
 Exchanging for my wretchedness
 Your radiant robes of righteousness,
 I love the way You father me.
[V4]
 And when I look into Your eyes
 From deep within my spirit cries,
 I love the way You father me.
 Before such love I stand amazed
 And ever will through endless days,
 I love the way You father me.
