  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My Jesus, my lifeline,
 I need You more than I've ever known.
 There's no one quite like You,
 I'm crying out for Your loving.
[C]
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
 I've never known a love like this before.
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
 Accept this love I give to You,
 It's all I can do.
[V2]
 I'm searching, I'm longing,
 Please meet me just as You want to.
 I'll stand here to offer,
 Offer up this song of love to You.
