[V1]
 All the riches of His grace,
 All the fulness of His blessings,
 All the sweetness of His love
 He gives to you,
 He gives to me.
[V2]
 Oh, the blood of Jesus,
 Oh, the blood of Jesus,
 Oh, the blood of Jesus,
 It washes white as snow.
[V3]
 Oh, the word of Jesus,
 Oh, the word of Jesus,
 Oh, the word of Jesus,
 It cleanses white as snow.
[V4]
 Oh, the love of Jesus,
 Oh, the love of Jesus,
 Oh, the love of Jesus,
 It makes His Body whole.
