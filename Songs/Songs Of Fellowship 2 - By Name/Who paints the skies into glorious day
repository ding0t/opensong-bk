[V1]
 Who paints the skies into glorious day?
 Only the splendour of Jesus. 
 Who breathes His life into fists of clay? 
 Only the splendour of Jesus. 
 ||Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain? 
 Only the splendour of Jesus. 
 Who makes the desert to live again? 
 Only the splendour of Jesus. 
[B]
 Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
 Each generation shall sing His praise.
[C]
 He is wonderful, He is glorious,
 Clothed in righteousness,
 Full of tenderness.
 Come and worship Him,
 He's the Prince of life,
 He will cleanse our hearts
 In His river of fire.
[V2]
 Who hears the cry of the barren one? 
 Only the mercy of Jesus. 
 Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone? 
 Only the mercy of Jesus. 
 ||Who storms the prison and sets men free,
 Only the mercy of Jesus. 
 Purchasing souls for eternity? 
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
