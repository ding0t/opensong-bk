  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Soften my heart,
 That I may know
 The love You have for me,
 More than words or well-worn phrases.
[V2]
 Soften my heart,
 For love to grow,
 The love I have for You,
 That keeps my motives pure andblameless.
[V3]
 Enter in,
 Come and have free reign
 As I walk with You today.
 Risen Lamb,
 Holy One,
 Overshadow me today.
