  <lyrics>
[V1]
 The cross has said it all,
 The cross has said it all.
 I can't deny what You have shown,
 The cross speaks of a God of love;
 There displayed for all to see,
 Jesus Christ, our only hope,
 A message of the Father's heart:
 'Come, my children, come on home.'
[C]
 As high as the heavens are above the earth,
 So high is the measure of Your great love;
 As far as the east is from the west,
 So far have You taken our sins from us.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 The cross has said it all,
 The cross has said it all.
 I never recognised Your touch
 Until I met You at the cross;
 We are fallen, dust to dust,
 How could You do this for us?
 Son of God shed precious blood:
 Who can comprehend this love?
[B]
 How high, how wide, how deep;
 How high, how wide, how deep;
 How high, how wide, how deep;
 How high!
