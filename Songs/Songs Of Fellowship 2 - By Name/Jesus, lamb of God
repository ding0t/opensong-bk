[V1]
 Jesus, lamb of God,
 I stand redeemed,
 Washed in Your blood.
 And in the holy place I'll bow
 To worship and adore.
[V2]
 Jesus, conquering King,
 You died for me,
 You bore my sins.
 Your love has brought me to my knees
 To worship and adore,
 To worship and adore.
[V3]
 How I love You,
 How I love You,
 How I love You,
 How I love You,
 How I love You.
