[V1]
 O Lord, how I love to sing Your praises.
 O Lord, how I love to dance for You.
 O Lord, You have captured my affection,
 Forever I will sing of Your love,
 Forever I will bring to You my life,
 Forever I will worship You.
[V2]
 And when I think of what You've done,
 It makes me shout for joy.
 And when I think of what's to come,
 Living forever in Your presence,
 Face to face with my magnificent obsession,
 Forever, forever I will be with You.
[V3]
 Oh, la, la, la ...
 Oh, la, la, la ...
 Oh, la, la, la ...
 Forever, forever I will be with You.
