[V1]
 I'm looking up to Jesus,
 His face is shining beauty.
 I'm feeling so unworthy,
 Yet His Spirit leads me on.
 I'm looking up to Jesus,
 His radiance surrounds me.
 I feel so pure and clean,
 A taste of heaven on earth.
[V2]
 I'm looking up to Jesus,
 His face is shining beauty.
 I'm feeling so unworthy,
 Yet His Spirit leads me on.
 I'm looking up to Jesus,
 His radiance surrounds me.
 I feel so pure and clean,
 A taste of heaven on earth.
 I'm looking up to Jesus.
