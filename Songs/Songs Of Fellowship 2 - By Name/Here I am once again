[V1]
 Here I am once again,
 I pour out my heart for I know that You hear
 Every cry; You are listening,
 No matter what state my heart is in.
[V2]
 You are faithful to answer
 With words that are true
 And a hope that is real.
 As I feel Your touch,
 You bring a freedom to all that's within.
 In the safety of this place
 I'm longing to...
[V3]
 Pour out my heart, to say that I love You,
 Pour out my heart, to say that I need You.
 Pour out my heart, to say that I'm thankful,
 Pour out my heart, to say that You're wonderful.
