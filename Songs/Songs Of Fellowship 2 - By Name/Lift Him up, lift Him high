  <lyrics>
[C]
 Lift Him up, lift Him high,
 Let His praises fill the sky.
 Oh, heaven's gates are open wide
 To those who hear the call.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 Through every generation
 This truth will always shine,
 That Christ came down among us,
 Now He is glorified.
[V2]
 The message of the kingdom
 Stands unshakeable through time:
 That man can be forgiven,
 If you seek then you will find.
