[V1]
 The heavens they preach, they preach,
 They preach the glorious splendour of God.
 The stars in the sky seem so out of reach,
 Yet they whisper His wonderful love.
 ||Day after day in a sermon of nature
 The works of His hands lift their voice:
 'Wake up, you nations, and serve Your Creator,
 There's mercy in Him, so rejoice!'
[C]
 And I'll lift my heart and my hands to Him,
 And I'll let my life shine with love
 To God's wonderful Son.
 He wears the crown, He's the King.
 ||Come and behold Him now,
 Come and delight in His excellent virtues;
 Seek Him while He can be found,
 For He is the help and the hope
 For all the world.
[V2]
 The prophets, they preached, they preached,
 They preached that one day a Saviour would come;
 And suddenly men heard a heavenly speech,
 The voice of God's only Son.
 ||Day after day in the streets and the temple
 He taught them and met their needs,
 And now through His death and His great resurrection
 His glorious purpose succeeds.
[V3]
 Your people will preach, we'll preach,
 We'll preach the unfailing riches of Christ;
 There's no one who's fallen too far from His reach,
 Who can't come from death into life.
 ||Day after day at the dawn of revival
 The multitudes seek His face,
 As we work to speed on His final arrival
 And crown Him with glory and praise!
