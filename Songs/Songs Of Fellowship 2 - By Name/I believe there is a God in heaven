[V1]
 I believe there is a God in heaven
 Who paid the price for all my sin;
 Shed His blood to open up the way
 For me to walk with Him.
[V2]
 Gave His life upon a cross,
 Took the punishment for us,
 Offered up Himself in love,
 Jesus, Jesus.
[V3]
 'It is finished' was His cry;
 Not even death could now deny
 The Son of God exalted high,
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Jesus.
