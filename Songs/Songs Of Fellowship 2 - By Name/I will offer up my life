  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will offer up my life
 In spirit and truth,
 Pouring out the oil of love
 As my worship to You.
 In surrender I must give my every part;
 Lord, receive the sacrifice
 Of a broken heart.
[C]
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung
 As a praise of Your name
 For the things You have done?
 ||Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part,
 Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart.
[V2]
 You deserve my every breath
 For You've paid the great cost;
 Giving up Your life to death,
 Even death on a cross.
 You took all my shame away,
 There defeated my sin,
 Opened up the gates of heaven,
 And have beckoned me in.
