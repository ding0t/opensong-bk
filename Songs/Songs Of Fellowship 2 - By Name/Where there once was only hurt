  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Where there once was only hurt,
 He gave His healing hand;
 Where there once was only pain,
 He brought comfort like a friend.
 I feel the sweetness of His love
 Piercing my darkness.
 I see the bright and morning sun
 As it ushers in His joyful gladness.
[C]
 He's turned my mourning into dancing again,
 He's lifted my sorrow.
 I can't stay silent, I must sing
 For His joy has come.
[V2]
 His anger lasts for a moment in time;
 But His favour is here
 And will be on me for all my lifetime.
