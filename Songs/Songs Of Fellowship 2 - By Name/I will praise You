  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will praise You,
 O Lord, with all of my heart.
 I will praise You,
 O Lord, with all of my heart.
 Before the Gods I will sing Your praise.
 Before the Gods I will praise Your name.
[C]
 The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me.
 The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me.
 Do not forsake the work of Your hands,
 Revive me, Lord.
[V2]
 You have exalted above all things
 Your name and Your word.
 You have exalted above all things
 Your name and Your word.
 I called to You, and You answered me.
 When I called to You, You made me strong.
[V3]
 For Your love, O Lord, endures forever,
 And Your faithfulness is to the clouds.
 Do not forsake the work of Your hands,
 Revive me, Lord.
