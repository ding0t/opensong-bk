  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You make Your face to shine on me,
 And that my soul knows very well;
 You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free,
 And that my soul knows very well.
[C]
 When mountains fall I'll stand
 By the power of Your hand,
 And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell,
 And that my soul knows very well.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Joy and strength each day I'll find,
 And that my soul knows very well;
 Forgiveness, hope I know is mine,
 And that my soul knows very well.
