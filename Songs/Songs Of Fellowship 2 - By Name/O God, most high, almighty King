  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O God, most high, almighty King,
 The Champion of heaven, Lord of everything;
 You've fought, You've won, death's lost its sting,
 And standing in Your victory we sing.
[C]
 You have broken the chains
 That held our captive souls.
 You have broken the chains
 And used them on Your foes.
 All Your enemies are bound,
 They tremble at the sound of Your name;
 Jesus, You have broken the chains.
[V2]
 The power of hell has been undone,
 Captivity held captive by the risen One,
 And in the name of God's great Son,
 We claim the mighty victory You've won.
