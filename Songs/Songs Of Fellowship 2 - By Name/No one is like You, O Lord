[V1]
 No one is like You, O Lord;
 You are great and Your name is mighty.
 No one is like You, O Lord;
 You are great and Your name is mighty.
 ||Who should not revere You,
 O King of the nations?
 Who should not revere You,
 For this is Your due?
 Among all wise men
 In all of their kingdoms,
 There is none like You.
[V2]
 No one is like You, O Lord;
 You're enthroned over all the nations.
 No one is like You, O Lord;
 You're enthroned over all the nations.
 ||Who should not revere You,
 O King of the nations?
 Who should not revere You,
 For this is Your due?
 Among all the wise men
 In all of their kingdoms,
 There is none like You.
[V3]
 None like You, O Lord,
 The King and the Creator.
 None like You, O Lord,
 Our Father and our Maker.
 None like You, O Lord,
 Your faithfulness surrounds You.
 How majestic is Your name,
 As Your people we proclaim:
