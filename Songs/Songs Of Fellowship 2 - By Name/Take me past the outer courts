  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Take me past the outer courts,
 And through the holy place,
 Past the brazen altar,
 Lord, I want to see Your face.
 Pass me by the crowds of people,
 And the priests who sing their praise;
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,
 But it's only found one place,
[C]
 So take me into the Holy of holies,
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb;
 So take me into the Holy of holies,
 Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
