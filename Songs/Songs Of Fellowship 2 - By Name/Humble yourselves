  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Humble yourselves
 Under God's mighty hand,
 So that He will lift you up.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Cast all anxiety
 On Him,
 Because He cares for You.
[V3]
 Open your hearts
 To the Lord your God,
 And know His love for you.
 (Repeat)
[V4]
 Cast all anxiety
 On Him,
 Because He cares for You.
[V5]
 I bow down
 Before You, my Lord.
 (Repeat)
