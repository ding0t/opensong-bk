[C]
 The light of Christ
 Has come into the world;
 The light of Christ
 Has come into the world.
[V1]
 All men must be born again
 To see the kingdom of God;
 The water and the Spirit
 Bring new life in God's love.
[V2]
 God gave up His only Son
 Out of love for the world,
 So that all men who believe in Him
 Will live forever.
[V3]
 The light of God has come to us
 So that we might have salvation;
 From the darkness of our sins we walk
 Into glory with Christ Jesus.
