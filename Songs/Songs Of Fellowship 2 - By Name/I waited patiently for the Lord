[V1]
 I waited patiently for the Lord,
 He turned and heard my cry.
 He lifted me from the pit,
 Out from the mud and mire.
 ||He put my feet on a rock,
 And gave me a firm place to stand.
 He put a new song in my mouth,
 A hymn of praise to God,
 A hymn of praise to God.
[C]
 Many will see, many will fear,
 And many will put their trust in the Lord.
 Many will see, many will fear,
 And many will put their trust in the Lord.
[V2]
 Blessed is the man who trusts the Lord,
 And turns from all the proud,
 From all those who have turned aside,
 To follow what is false.
 ||Many are the wonders that You have done,
 All the things You have planned;
 Were I to count they still would be
 Too many to declare,
 Too many to declare.
