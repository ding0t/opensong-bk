 Lord, You are worthy,
 Lord, You are worthy,
 Lord, You are worthy,
 We give You praise.

 Lord, You are holy,
 Lord, You are holy,
 We give You praise.

 Lord, we adore You,
 Lord, we adore You,
 Lord, we adore You,
 We give You praise.
[V4]
 Lord, You are worthy, 
 Lord, You are worthy, 
 Lord, You are worthy, 
 We give You praise.
