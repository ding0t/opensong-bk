[V1]
 Sometimes when I feel Your love
 As I walk along the busy street,
 I whisper Your name under my breath.
 And sometimes when I feel Your touch
 In the quiet place of my room,
 I sing Your name in adoration.
 ||And there are times when I feel like I'm bursting
 With Your love so strong and so true;
 And in my heart I feel such a yearning,
 And I want all the world
 To know You love them, too.
[V2]
 I love Your love,
 Gonna shout it out aloud.
 I love Your love,
 Wanna tell the world about it.
 I love Your love,
 'Cause I've found it to be true,
 And I live to love You, too.
