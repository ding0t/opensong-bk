[C]
 There is no one like our God in all the earth.
 There is no one like our God in all the earth.
 No one like our God,
 No one like our God.
[V1]
 Our God has made the heavens,
 Our God has made the earth;
 And everything that lives,
 His word has brought to birth.
[V2]
 He numbers every star,
 And calls each one by name;
 He fills the skies with clouds,
 Supplies the earth with rain.
[V3]
 Sing praises to our God,
 Sing praises to His name;
 His love will never end,
 His word will never fail.
[B]
 God is with us.
 God is with us.
 God is with us.
