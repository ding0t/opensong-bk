[V1]
 Did you feel the mountains tremble?
 Did you hear the oceans roar,
 When the people rose to sing of
 Jesus Christ, the risen One?
[V2]
 Did you feel the people tremble?
 Did you hear the singers roar,
 When the lost began to sing of
 Jesus Christ, the saving One?
[V3]
 And we can see that God, You're moving,
 A mighty river through the nations.
 And young and old will turn to Jesus.
 Fling wide you heavenly gates,
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
[C]
 Open up the doors
 And let the music play,
 Let the streets resound with singing.
 Songs that bring Your hope,
 Songs that bring Your joy,
 Dancers who dance upon injustice.
[V4]
 Do you feel the darkness tremble,
 When all the saints join in one song,
 And all the streams flow as one river,
 To wash away our brokenness?
[V5]
 And we can see that God, You're moving,
 A time of jubilee is coming,
 When young and old will turn to Jesus.
 Fling wide you heavenly gates,
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
