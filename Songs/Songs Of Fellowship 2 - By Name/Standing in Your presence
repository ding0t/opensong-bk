  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Standing in Your presence,
 Lord, my heart and life are changed;
 Just to love You and to live to
 See Your beauty and Your grace.
[C]
 Heaven and earth cry out Your name,
 Nations rise up and see Your face;
 And Your kingdom is established
 As I live to know You more.
 ||Now I will never be the same;
 Spirit of God, my life You've changed,
 And I'll forever sing Your praise.
 I live to know You, Lord.
 I live to know You, Lord.
[V2]
 You've called me, I will follow;
 Your will for me I'm sure.
 Let Your heartbeat be my heart's cry,
 Let me live to serve Your call.
