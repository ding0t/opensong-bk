[V1]
 I know a place
 Where blessings from heaven are poured,
 Mercy and grace abounding.
 Through Jesus' blood
 We have now been set free
 Into the Father's loving.
[V2]
 I know a place
 Where there is no guilt or fear,
 As I come into His presence.
 I can now know
 A peace which surpasses all,
 Nothing shall separate us.
[C]
 And I will trust in You alone,
 My refuge and strength.
 For all the trials that come my way,
 Your grace is sufficient for me.
[V3]
 I know a place
 Where a wonderful river flows,
 That fills me with His glory;
 Bringing us life,
 We're stirred to adore Him,
 A perfect joy everlasting.
