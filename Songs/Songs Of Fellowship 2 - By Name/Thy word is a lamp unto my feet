[C]
 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
 And a light unto my path.
 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
 And a light unto my path.
[V1]
 When I feel afraid,
 Think I've lost my way,
 Still You're there right beside me.
 And nothing will I fear
 As long as You are near;
 Please be near me to the end.
[V2]
 I will not forget
 Your love for me, and yet
 My heart forever is wandering.
 Jesus, be my guide
 And hold me to Your side,
 And I will love You to the end.
