  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Here is bread, here is wine,
 Christ is with us - He is with us;
 Break the bread, drink the wine -
 Christ is with us here.
[V2]
 Here is grace, here is peace,
 Christ is with us - He is with us;
 Know His grace, find His peace -
 Feast on Jesus here.
[C]
 In this bread there is healing,
 In this cup there's life forever;
 In this moment, by the Spirit
 Christ is with us here.
[V3]
 Here we are, joined in one,
 Christ is with us - He is with us;
 We'll proclaim, till He comes -
 Jesus crucified.
