  <lyrics>
[V1]
 At the foot of the cross,
 I can hardly take it in,
 That the King of all creation
 Was dying for my sin.
 And the pain and agony,
 And the thorns that pierced Your head,
 And the hardness of my sinful heart
 That left You there for dead.
[V2]
 And O what mercy I have found
 At the cross of Calvary;
 I will never know Your loneliness,
 All on account of me.
 And I will bow my knee before Your throne,
 'cause Your love has set me free;
 ||And I will give my life to You, dear Lord,
 And praise Your majesty,
 And praise Your majesty,
 And praise Your majesty.
