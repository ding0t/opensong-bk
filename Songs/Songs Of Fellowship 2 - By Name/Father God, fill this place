  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father God, fill this place
 With Your love, with Your grace.
 As we call on Your name,
 Visit us in power again.
[C]
 Lord, we worship You.
 Lord, we worship You.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Spirit come with Your peace;
 Heal our wounds, bring release.
 Lord we long for Your touch,
 Fill our hearts with Your love.
