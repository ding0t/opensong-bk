  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Draw me close to the cross,
 To the place of Your love,
 To the place where You poured out Your mercy;
 Where the river of life
 That flows from Your wounded side
 Brings refreshing to those who draw near.
 ||Draw me close to Your throne
 Where Your majesty is shown,
 Where the crown of my life I lay down.
 Draw me close to Your side,
 Where my heart is satisfied,
 Draw me close to You, Lord,
 Draw me close.
