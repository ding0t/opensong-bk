[V1]
 Thank You for saving me;
 What can I say?
 You are my everything,
 I will sing Your praise.
 You shed Your blood for me;
 What can I say?
 You took my sin and shame,
 A sinner called by name.
[C]
 Great is the Lord.
 Great is the Lord.
 For we know Your truth has set us free;
 You've set Your hope in me.
[V2]
 Mercy and grace are mine,
 Forgiven is my sin;
 Jesus, my only hope,
 The Saviour of the world.
 'Great is the Lord,' we cry;
 God, let Your kingdom come.
 Your word has let me see,
 Thank You for saving me.
