  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You shall be holy
 And in everything be true,
 For I, the Lord, am holy,
 And My word belongs to you.
[V2]
 Stay in my presence,
 Grow strong in My love,
 With all the gifts I give you
 From My kingdom here above.
[V3]
 We are Your children,
 Abba Father, mighty God,
 And growing in Your likeness,
 Through grace of Jesus' blood.
[V4]
 Inspired by Your Spirit,
 Our eternal source of power,
 Release us to worship,
 And to praise You every hour.
