[V1]
 Here is the risen son,
 Riding out in glory,
 Radiating light all around.
 Here is the Holy Spirit,
 Poured out for the nations,
 Glorifying Jesus the Lamb.
[V2]
 We will stand as a people
 Who are upright and holy,
 We will worship the Lord of hosts.
 We will watch, we will wait
 On the walls of the city,
 We will look and see what He will say to us.
[V3]
 Every knee shall bow before Him,
 Every tongue confess
 That He is King of kings, Lord of Lords,
 And Ruler of the earth.
