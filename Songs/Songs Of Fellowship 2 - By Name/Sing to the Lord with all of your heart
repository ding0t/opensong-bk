  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Sing to the Lord with all of your heart;
 Sing of the glory that's due to His name.
 Sing to the Lord with all of your soul,
 Join all of heaven and earth to proclaim:
[C]
 You are the Lord, the Saviour of all,
 God of creation, we praise You.
 We sing the songs that awaken thedawn,
 God of creation, we praise You.
[V2]
 Sing to the Lord with all of your mind,
 With understanding give thanks to the King.
 Sing to the Lord with all of your strength,
 Living our lives as a praise offering.
