[V1]
 I will rest in Christ
 Like the calm within the storm;
 I can find security in Him who leads me on.
 I will put my faith, my trust and every hope,
 For the peace of God will touch my soul,
 In Him I will be whole.
[V2]
 I am not dismayed, I am not cast down;
 I will never be alone, I need never fear.
 I can always hope, I can always love;
 For the love of God has touched my heart,
 In Him I am secure.
[C]
 I will rest in Christ;
 I will hope in Him.
 I will find a place of comfort,
 I can find a place of rest,
 Held in love, loved in Him,
 Safe, I am secure,
 As I rest in Christ,
 As I hope in Him.
[V3]
 I will trust in Christ
 Like a rock in stormy seas;
 I have found a shelter in His life and peace in me.
 I have found the way,
 The truth, this perfect life;
 And the hope in me is found in Him,
 The lover of my soul.
