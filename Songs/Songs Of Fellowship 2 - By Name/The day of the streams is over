[C]
 The day of the streams is over,
 The time of the river is here.
 (Repeat x4)
[V1]
 I hear the sound of a mighty river,
 Of rushing water running free
 To every land, through every border,
 Flowing now across this earth.
[V2]
 There is a time I know is coming,
 When all God's people join as one;
 They will become a great awakening,
 Bringing life to all the world.
[B]
 And the river is flowing,
 Getting wider and wider,
 Deeper and deeper
 As it flows from the throne;
 And the leaves on the trees
 Are for the healing of the nations,
 It's as clear as crystal,
 It's the water of life.
