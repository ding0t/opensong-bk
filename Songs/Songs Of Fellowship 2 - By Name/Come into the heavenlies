[V1]
 Come into the heavenlies
 And sing the song the angels sing,
 Worthy, worthy.
 Come into the heavenlies,
 And sing the song the angels sing,
 Worthy, worthy.
[V2]
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 Worthy is the Lamb.
[V3]
 Worthy of blessing and honour,
 Worthy of glory and power,
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 (Repeat)
