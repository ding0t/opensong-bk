  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Search me, O God,
 And know my heart;
 Know all my thoughts and my ways.
 Cleanse me, O God,
 Give me a pure heart,
 That I may see Your face.
[C]
 For You are an all consuming fire!
 For You are an all consuming fire!
[V2]
 Teach me, O God,
 Show me Your ways,
 And I will walk in Your truth.
 Keep me, O God,
 Keep me from falling,
 That I may stand before You.
[V3]
 Fill me, O God,
 And send me out,
 And I will make You known.
 Give me Your heart
 And Your compassion,
 And let Your mercy flow.
