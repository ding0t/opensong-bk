  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We have flooded the altar with our tears;
 We have wearied You, Lord, with our words.
 Great God, our promises we've broken,
 O Lord, forgive me.
[V2]
 You are breaking the pride in our hearts;
 You have given us tears for the lost.
 You crown the humble with salvation;
 O Lord, humble me.
[C]
 So lead me, oh lead me into Your arms;
 I will be safe in the shadow of Your wing.
 Lead me, oh lead me into Your arms;
 I will be safe in Almighty.
[V3]
 You have paid back our sin with Your love;
 Lover's arms You have offered us.
 Faithful One, raise up a faithful people
 Who find their treasure here.
