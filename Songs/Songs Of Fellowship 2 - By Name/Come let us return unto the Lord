[C]
 Come let us return unto the Lord.  (Men - Women echo)
 Come let us return unto the Lord.  (Men - Women echo)
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 For He has torn us,
 But He will heal us.
 For He has wounded us,
 But He will bandage us.
[V2]
 And He will come,
 He'll come to us
 Like rain, spring rain.
 He will come to us
 Like rain, spring rain.
