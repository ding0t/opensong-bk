[V1]
 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
 And wonder how He could love me,
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.
[C]
 How marvellous! How wonderful!
 And my song shall ever be:
 How marvellous! How wonderful!
 Is my Saviour's love for me!
[V2]
 For me it was in the garden He prayed,
 'Not My will, but Thine':
 He had no tears for His own griefs,
 But sweat drops of blood for mine.
[V3]
 In pity angels beheld Him,
 And came from the world of light
 To comfort Him in the sorrows
 He bore for my soul that night.
[V4]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden of Calvary,
 And suffered and died alone.
[V5]
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see,
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me.
