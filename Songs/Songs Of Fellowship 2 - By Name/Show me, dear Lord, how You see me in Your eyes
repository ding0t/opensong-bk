[V1]
 Show me, dear Lord, how You see me in Your eyes,
 So that I can realise Your great love for me.
 Teach me, O Lord, that I am precious in Your sight,
 That as a father loves his child, so You love me.
[C]
 I am Yours because You have chosen me.
 I'm Your child because You've called my name,
 And Your steadfast love will never change;
 I will always be Your precious child.
[V2]
 Show me, dear Lord, that I can never earn Your love,
 That a gift cannot be earned, only given.
 Teach me, O Lord, that Your love will never fade,
 That I can never drive away Your great mercy.
