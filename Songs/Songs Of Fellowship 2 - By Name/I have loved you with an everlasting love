  <lyrics>
[C]
 I have loved you with an everlasting love,
 And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.
 And I have loved you with an everlasting love,
 And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.
[V1]
 Because God loved you and to keep His own,
 He brought you out with a mighty hand,
 He redeemed you from the devil's yoke.
 ||Oh, the Lord, He is the God
 And faithful is He.
 He'll keep His word and His covenant,
 Giving mercy and prosperity.
[V2]
 And casting all of Your cares on Him
 For He cares for you,
 There's a love dimension
 In the kingdom of God,
 It's sure to take you through.
 ||God commanded His love toward us,
 Christ died on a tree,
 Then He rose again, the living God,
 More than conquerors now are we.
