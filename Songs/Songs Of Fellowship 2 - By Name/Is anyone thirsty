  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Is anyone thirsty, anyone?
 Is anyone thirsty?
 Is anyone thirsty, anyone?
 Is anyone thirsty? Jesus said:
 'Let them come to me and drink,
 Let them come to me.'
[C]
 O, let the living waters flow,
 O, let the living waters flow,
 Let the river of Your Spirit
 Flow through me.
 (Repeat)
 Flow through me.
[V2]
 Let the living waters flow.
 Let the living waters flow.
 Let the living waters flow.
 Let the living waters flow.
