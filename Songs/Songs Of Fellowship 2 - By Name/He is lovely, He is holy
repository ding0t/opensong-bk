  <lyrics>
[V1]
 He is lovely, He is holy,
 Gave supremely, that all men may see.
 He is gentle, tender-hearted,
 Risen Saviour, He is God.
[V2]
 Master, Maker, Life Creator,
 Come and dwell in me,
 That my heart may know
 Your tender mercy.
 Shine through me that all may see
 Your love so full and free;
 And I'll declare Your praise
 Through endless ages.
