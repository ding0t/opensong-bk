[V1]
 These are the days of Elijah,
 Declaring the word of the Lord:
 And these are the days of Your servant Moses,
 Righteousness being restored.
 ||And though these are days of great trial,
 Of famine and darkness and sword,
 Still, we are a voice in the desert crying
 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'
[C]
 Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
 Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
 Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.
[V2]
 These are the days of Ezekiel,
 The dry bones becoming as flesh;
 And these are the days of Your servant David,
 Rebuilding the temple of praise.
 ||These are the days of the harvest,
 The fields are as white in the world,
 And we are the labourers in the vineyard,
 Declaring the word of the Lord.
