  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Catch the fire,
 Swim through the waters,
 Fly on the wings of the Spirit.
 (Repeat)
[C]
 Hear the sound that fills heaven,
 Hear the beat of my heart.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 As a Lover, gazing on His bride;
 As a Father looking for His child;
 As the Shepherd,
 Searching for the one that's lost;
 As the Saviour, weeping for the world.
