  <lyrics>
[V1]
 The angels, Lord, they sing
 Around Your throne;
 And we will join their song:
 Praise You alone.
 (Repeat)
[C]
 Holy, holy, holy,
 Lord our God,
 Who was and is and is to come.
 Holy, holy, holy,
 Lord our God,
 Who was and is and is to come.
[V2]
 The living creatures, Lord,
 Speak endless praise;
 And joining at Your throne,
 We'll sing their sweet refrain.
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 The elders, Lord,they fall
 Before Your throne;
 Our hearts we humbly bow
 To You alone.
 (Repeat)
