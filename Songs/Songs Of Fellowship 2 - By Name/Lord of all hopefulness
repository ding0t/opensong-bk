[V1]
 Lord of all hopefulness,
 Lord of all joy,
 Whose trust, ever child-like,
 No cares could destroy;
 Be there at our waking,
 And give us, we pray,
 Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,
 At the break of the day.
[V2]
 Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,
 Whose strong hands were skilled
 At the plane and the lathe;
 Be there at our labours,
 And give us, we pray,
 Your strength in our hearts, Lord,
 At the noon of the day.
[V3]
 Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,
 Your hands swift to welcome,
 Your arms to embrace;
 Be there at our homing,
 And give us, we pray,
 Your love in our hearts, Lord,
 At the eve of the day.
[V4]
 Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm,
 Whose voice is contentment,
 Whose presence is balm;
 Be there at our sleeping,
 And give us, we pray,
 Your peace in our hearts, Lord,
 At the end of the day.
