[V1]
 Give me, Lord, a dream from heaven,
 Let me see the things You see;
 Give me purpose and direction,
 Holy Spirit, move on me.
 I would set my face to serve You,
 To do the things You'd have me do;
 Stir within my heart a vision,
 Lord, I will follow You.
[C]
 By Your Spirit and Your word,
 We would hasten Your return.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Give to me a holy passion,
 With every breath I will proclaim
 The message of Your kingdom,
 The glory of Your name.
 Lead me into action,
 Let me do the things You say;
 Send me to the nations,
 When You speak I will obey.
[V3]
 I believe that faith is rising,
 I can see a tidal wave
 Of Your Spirit that is moving
 To end this final age.
 There'll be shouts of acclamation
 When You come back for Your Bride;
 History's consummation
 Is here before our eyes.
