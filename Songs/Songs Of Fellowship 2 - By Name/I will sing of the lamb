[V1]
 I will sing of the lamb,
 Of the price that was paid for me,
 Purchased by God,
 Giving all He could give!
 Here now I stand
 In the garments of righteousness;
 Death has no hold, for in Jesus I live.
[V2]
 I will sing of His blood
 That flows for my wretchedness,
 Wounds that are bared,
 That I may be healed;
 Power and compassion,
 The marks of His ministry:
 May they be mine as I harvest His field.
[C1]
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 My heart fills with wonder,
 My mouth fills with praise!
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[V3]
 Once I was blind,
 Yet believed I saw everything,
 Proud in my ways,
 Yet a fool in my part;
 Lost and alone
 In the company of multitudes,
 Life in my body, yet death in my heart.
[C2]
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 Oh, why should the King
 Save a sinner like me?
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[V4]
 What shall I give
 To the Man who gave everything,
 Humbling Himself
 Before all He had made?
 Dare I withold
 My own life from His sovereignty?
 I shall give all for the sake of His name!
[C3]
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
 I'll sing of His love
 For the rest of my days!
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
