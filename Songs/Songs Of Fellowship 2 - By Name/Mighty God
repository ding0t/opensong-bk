[C]
 Mighty God,
 Everlasting Father,
 Wonderful Counsellor,
 You're the Prince of Peace.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 You are Lord of heaven,
 You are called Emmanuel;
 God is now with us,
 Ever present to deliver.
 You are God eternal,
 You are Lord of all the earth;
 Love has come to us,
 Bringing us new birth.
[V2]
 A light to those in darkness,
 And a guide to paths of peace;
 Love and mercy dawns,
 Grace, forgiveness and salvation.
 Light for revelation,
 Glory to Your people;
 Son of the Most High,
 God's love gift to all.
