  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God sent His son, they called Him Jesus;
 He came to love, heal, and forgive;
 He lived and died to buy my pardon,
 An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives.
[C]
 Because He lives I can face tomorrow;
 Because He lives all fear is gone;
 Because I know He holds the future,
 And life is worth the living
 Just because He lives.
[V2]
 How sweet to hold a new-born baby,
 And feel the pride and joy he gives;
 But greater still the calm assurance,
 This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
[V3]
 And then one day I'll cross the river;
 I'll fight life's final war with pain;
 And then as death gives way to victory,
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.
