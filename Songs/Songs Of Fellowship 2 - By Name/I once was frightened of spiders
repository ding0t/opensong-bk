[V1]
 I once was frightened of spiders,
 I once was frightened of the dark;
 I once was frightened of many, many things,
 Especially things that barked.
 ||But now I'm asking Jesus
 To help these fears to go,
 'Cause I don't want them to be part of me,
 No, no, no, no, no.
[V2]
 I once was frightened by thunder,
 And frightened by lightning too;
 I once was frightened by many, many things
 That crashed and banged and blew.
 ||But now I'm asking Jesus
 To help these fears to go,
 'Cause I don't want them to be part of me,
 No, no, no, no, no.
