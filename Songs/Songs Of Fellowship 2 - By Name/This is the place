  <lyrics>
[V1]
 This is the place
 Where dreams are found,
 Where vision comes,
 Called holy ground.
[C]
 Holy ground,
 I'm standing on holy ground,
 For the Lord my God
 Is here with me.
[V2]
 Your fire burns
 But never dies;
 I realise
 This is holy ground.
[V3]
 The Great I AM,
 Revealed to man;
 Take off your shoes,
 This is holy ground.
