  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Have you not said as we pass through water,
 You will be with us?
 And You have said as we walk through fire,
 We will not be burned.
 ||We are not afraid, for You are with us;
 We will testify to the honour of Your name.
 We are witnesses, You have shown us
 You are the One who can save.
[C]
 Fill us up and send us out
 In the power of Your name.
 Fill us up and send us out
 In the power of Your name.
[V2]
 Bring them from the west, sons and daughters,
 Call them for Your praise.
 Gather from the east all Your children,
 Coming home again.
 ||Bring them from afar, all the nations,
 From the north and south,
 Drawing all the peoples in.
 Corners of the earth, come to see there's
 Only one Saviour and King.
