[C]
 The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns,
 The Lord reigns,
 Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice,
 Let the earth rejoice.
 Let the people be glad
 That our God reigns.
[V1]
 A fire goes before Him
 And burns up all His enemies;
 The hills melt like wax
 At the presence of the Lord,
 At the presence of the Lord.
[V2]
 The heavens declare His righteousness,
 The peoples see His glory;
 For You, O Lord, are exalted
 Over all the earth,
 Over all the earth.
