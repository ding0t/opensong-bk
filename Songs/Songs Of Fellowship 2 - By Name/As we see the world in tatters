[V1]
 As we see the world in tatters,
 As we watch their dreams break down,
 We can hear their quiet anguish:
 'Come and help us!'
 Brought to life by God's own Spirit,
 Joined together in His Son,
 Now the church with strength arises
 Like an army.
[C]
 Every place, every place
 Where our feet shall tread,
 Every tribe, every race
 God has given us.
[V2]
 In the midst of boastful darkness
 Shines a Light that cannot fail,
 And the blind behold His glory,
 Jesus! Jesus!
 Not content with restoration
 Of the remnant in the land,
 He has filled us with His power
