[C]
 Nothing shall separate us
 From the love of God.
 Nothing shall separate us
 From the love of God.
[V1]
 God did not spare His only Son,
 Gave Him to save us all.
 Sin's price was met by Jesus' death
 And heaven's mercy falls.
[V2]
 Up from the grave Jesus was raised
 To sit at God's right hand;
 Pleading our cause in heaven's courts,
 Forgiven we can stand.
[V3]
 Now by God's grace we have embraced
 A life set free from sin;
 We shall deny all that destroys
 Our union with Him.
