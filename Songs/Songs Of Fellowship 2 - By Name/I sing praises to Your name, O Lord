[V1]
 I sing praises to Your name, O Lord,
 Praises to Your name, O Lord,
 For Your name is great and greatly to be praised.
 I sing praises to Your name, O Lord,
 Praises to Your name, O Lord,
 For Your name is great and greatly to be praised.
[V2]
 I give glory to Your name, O Lord,
 Glory to Your name, O Lord,
 For Your name is great and greatly to be praised.
 I give glory to Your name, O Lord,
 Glory to Your name, O Lord,
 For Your name is great and greatly to be praised.
