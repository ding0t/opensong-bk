[V1]
 When can I go and meet with God?
 My soul is weak, my body tired.
 Can it be here, can it be now?
 I need to find that place again.
[V2]
 When can I come and meet You, God?
 I thirst inside for heaven's touch.
 Let it be here, let it be now;
 I need to find that place again...
[C]
 Where deep calls to deep
 In the roar of Your waterfalls,
 You're calling me
 With the force of Your love.
 ||Let Your waves sweep
 Over all the dry places, Lord;
 Usher me in to the depths of Your heart,
 Where deep calls to deep,
 Where deep calls to deep,
 Where deep calls to deep,
 Where deep calls to deep.
[V3]
 I want to know Your risen power.
 I need to share Your sufferings;
 And as I die to my own will,
 Lord, raise me to that place again.
