  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Go to all nations, making disciples,
 Baptising them in My name.
 Go to all nations, making disciples,
 Baptising them in My name.
[C]
 I am coming soon.
 I am coming soon.
 I'm waiting at the gates
 For the Father's call.
 I am coming soon.
 Yes, I am coming soon.
[V2]
 Teach them to do all I told you to do,
 Teach them to walk in My ways.
 I have authority in heaven and earth,
 I will be with you always.
