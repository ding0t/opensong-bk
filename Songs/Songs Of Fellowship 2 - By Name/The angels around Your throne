[V1]
 The angels around Your throne,
 They cry, 'Holy is the Lamb.'
 The angels around Your throne,
 They cry, 'Holy is the Lamb.'
 So we sing holy, holy, holy,
 Holy is the Lamb.
 So we sing holy, holy, holy,
 Holy is the Lamb.
[V2]
 The angels around Your throne,
 They cry, 'Worthy is the Lamb.'
 The angels around Your throne,
 They cry, 'Worthy is the Lamb.'
 So we sing worthy, worthy, worthy,
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 So we sing worthy, worthy, worthy,
 Worthy is the Lamb.
