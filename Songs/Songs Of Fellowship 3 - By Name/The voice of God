[V1]
 The voice of God is calling 
 With words that roar and rage;
 The passion of the Father's heart 
 Resounds through every age.
 Multitudes are waiting 
 For this gospel we proclaim;
 Christ Jesus came among us 
 That all men might be saved.
 
[C]
 Show Your glory, show Your glory,
 Show Your glory over all the earth.
 Show Your glory, show Your glory,
 Show Your glory over all the earth.
 
[V2]
 This is our commission, 
 To fill the air with praise
 And to tell the people of this world 
 The glory of His name.
 With thousands upon thousands 
 From every tribe and tongue
 We cry, 'Worthy is the Lamb once slain, 
 For He has overcome!'
 
[V3]
 With tears of intercession, 
 Through the prayers of all the saints,
 We long to reach the nations 
 With humility and grace.
 Come touch this generation 
 And use us, Lord, we pray;
 Fill our hearts with boldness 
 To do the things You say.
