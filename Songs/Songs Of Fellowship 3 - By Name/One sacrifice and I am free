[V1]
 One sacrifice and I am free,
 The cross of Christ my victory,
 And on this grace I do believe, yes I believe.
 Jesus, in death You set me free,
 Taking the punishment for me,
 It is Your blood that covers me, yes I believe.
 
[V2]
 And because of what this love has done
 My heart is filled with praise.
 
[C]
 And so I lift my voice to You,
 Pouring out all this love on You.
 What can I give for all You've done for me?
 I know the Saviour lives today,
 Heaven and earth may pass away,
 But I know Your love will never fail.
 
[V3]
 And every day I live, I vow to follow You.
