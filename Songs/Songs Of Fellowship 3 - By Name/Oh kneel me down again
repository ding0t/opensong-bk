[V1]
 Oh kneel me down again, 
 Here at Your feet;
 Show me how much You love humility.
 Oh Spirit, be the star that leads me to
 The humble heart of love I see in You.
 
[V2]
 You are the God of the broken,
 The friend of the weak;
 You wash the feet of the weary,
 Embrace the ones in need.
 I want to be like You, Jesus,
 To have this heart in me.
 You are the God of the humble,
 You are the humble King.
