[V1]
 Come down, O love divine,
 Seek Thou this soul of mine
 And visit it with Thine own ardour glowing;
 O Comforter, draw near,
 Within my heart appear,
 And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.
 
[V2]
 O let it freely burn,
 Till earthly passions turn
 To dust and ashes, in its heat consuming;
 And let Thy glorious light
 Shine ever on my sight,
 And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.
 
[V3]
 Let holy charity
 Mine outward vesture be,
 And lowliness become mine inner clothing;
 True lowliness of heart,
 Which takes the humbler part,
 And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.
 
[V4]
 And so the yearning strong,
 With which the soul will long,
 Shall far outpass the power of human telling;
 For none can guess its grace,
 Till he become the place
 Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.
