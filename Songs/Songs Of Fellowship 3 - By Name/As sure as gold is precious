[V1]
 As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet,
 So You love this city and You love these streets.
 Every child out playing by their own front door;
 Every baby lying on the bedroom floor.
 
[V2]
 Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job;
 Every driver driving through the rush hour mob.
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones,
 You're going to send revival,
 Bring them all back home.
 
[C]
 I can hear that thunder in the distance,
 Like a train on the edge of the town;
 I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit:
 'Lay your burdens down, lay your burdens down.'
 
[V3]
 From the preacher preaching when the well is dry,
 To the lost soul reaching for a higher high.
 From the young man working through his hopes and fears,
 To the widow walking through the vale of tears.
 
[V4]
 Every man and woman, every old and young;
 Every father's daughter, every mother's son.
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones,
 You're going to send revival,
 Bring them all back home.
 
[V5]
 Revive us, revive us,
 Revive us with Your fire!
 Revive us, revive us,
 Revive us with Your fire!
