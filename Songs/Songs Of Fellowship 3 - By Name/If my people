[V1]
 If my people, who are called by My name,
 Will humble themselves and pray,
 And will seek My face,
 And turn from their wicked ways.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin.
 Yes, I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin.
 Yes, I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin,
 And will heal their land, 
 Yes, I will heal their land.
 
[V3]
 Will You hear from heaven and forgive my sin?
 Oh, will You hear from heaven and forgive my sin?
 Will You hear from heaven and forgive my sin?
 Oh, will You hear from heaven and forgive my sin?
