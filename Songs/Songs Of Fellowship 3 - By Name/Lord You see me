[V1]
 Lord, You see me through Your mercy:
 I am guilty, still You love me.
 In Your kindness there is justice;
 Through Your goodness, 
 You have brought me
 
[C]
 Here, where truth and mercy meet,
 You triumph over me,
 Your love has won my heart again.
 And still I am so amazed,
 My guilt is washed away
 Before Your cross of peace,
 Where truth and mercy meet.
 
[V2]
 King of glory, Lord of mercy,
 Risen Saviour, Perfect Wonder.
 Through Your kindness
 You have drawn me,
 By Your suffering
 You have saved me.
