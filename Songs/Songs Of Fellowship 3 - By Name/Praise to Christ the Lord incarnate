[V1]
 Praise to Christ, the Lord incarnate,
 Gift of God by human birth:
 He it is who came among us,
 Shared our life and showed our worth;
 Ours the turmoil He encountered,
 Ours the fight He made His own;
 Now within our hearts His Spirit
 Makes His way of freedom known.
 
[C]
 Praise to Christ our Saviour and our King.
 Praise to Christ our King.
 
[V2]
 Praise to Christ, the Man of Sorrows,
 Tasting death for our release:
 His the cup of bitter anguish,
 Ours the pardon, ours the peace;
 His the blood that seals forgiveness,
 Ours the weight of guilt He bore -
 So by death and resurrection
 Christ has opened heaven's door.
 
[V3]
 Praise to Christ, the Priest eternal:
 Still for us He intercedes;
 Still He sees our pains and problems -
 How He understands our needs!
 Yesterday, today, forever,
 Always He remains the same:
 Pledged to bring us to the Father,
 Strong in grace and free from blame.
