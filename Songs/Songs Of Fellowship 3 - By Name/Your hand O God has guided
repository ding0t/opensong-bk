[V1]
 Your hand, O God, has guided
 Your church from age to age,
 The tale of love is written 
 For us on every page.
 Our fathers knew Your goodness, 
 And we Your works record,
 And each of these bear witness:
 One church, one faith, one Lord.
 
[C]
 One church, one faith, one Lord of life,
 One Father, one Spirit, one Christ.
 One church, one faith, one Lord of life,
 One heavenly King, Lord of all.
 
[V2]
 Your mercy never fails us, 
 Or leaves Your work undone;
 With Your right hand to help us, 
 The victory shall be won.
 And then with heaven's angels 
 Your name shall be adored,
 And they shall praise You, singing:
 One church, one faith, one Lord.
