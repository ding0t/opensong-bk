[C]
 Tell the world that Jesus is risen,
 Let His praise encircle the globe;
 Make it known among all the nations 
 That Jesus is alive!
 
[V1]
 From the cradle to the grave,
 From a stable to a cross,
 His life was offered up in sacrifice for us.
 He came from heaven's throne
 To seek and save the lost;
 To reconcile us back to God.
 
[V2]
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard what He's prepared;
 His resurrection means His life is ours to share.
 The greatest miracle of all has taken place;
 Christ is risen, He is Lord!
