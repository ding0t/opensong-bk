[V1]
 I will come, come, come to the waters and drink;
 I will praise, praise, praise Your name again.
 I will rest, rest, rest, rest at Your feet,
 For You have won my heart once again.
 
[V2]
 I will thirst, thirst, thirst for all that You give;
 And I will fall, fall, fall into Your arms again.
 I will call, call, call to You alone each day,
 For You have won my heart once again.
 
[C]
 And You are God,
 With fire in Your eyes,
 And You are God,
 Adorned in radiant light.
 You are God
 Whose hands were pierced for all:
 What choice do I have,
 But to give You my very all?
 
[V3]
 I shall wait, wait, wait at the cross where we meet;
 And I will live, live, live, by Your name I speak.
 I will run, run, run for Your face to seek,
 For You have won my heart once again.
