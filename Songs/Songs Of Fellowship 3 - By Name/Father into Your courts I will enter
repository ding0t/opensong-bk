[V1]
 Father, into Your courts I will enter,
 Maker of heaven and earth,
 I tremble in Your holy presence.
 Glory, glory in Your sanctuary,
 Splendour and majesty, Lord, before You; 
 All life adores You.
 
[C]
 All the earth will declare
 That Your love is everywhere.
 The fields will exalt, seas resound.
 Hear the trees' joyful cry,
 Praising You and so will I.
 A new song I'll sing,
 Lord, I will glorify and bless Your holy name.
