[V1]
 When a knight won His spurs in the stories of old,
 He was gentle and brave, he was gallant and bold;
 With a shield on his arm and a lance in his hand,
 For God and for valour he rode through the land.
 
[V2]
 No charger have I, and no sword by my side,
 Yet still to adventure and battle I ride,
 Though back into storyland giants have fled,
 And the knights are no more and the dragons are dead.
 
[V3]
 Let faith be my shield and let joy be my steed
 'Gainst the dragons of anger, the ogres of greed;
 And let me set free, with the sword of my youth,
 From the castle of darkness, the power of the truth.
