[V1]
 God of the mountains,
 God of the sea;
 God of the heavens
 Of eternity.
 God of the future,
 God of the past;
 God of the present,
 God of all history.
 
[C]
 Creation praise will thunder to You,
 Thunder to You, thunder to You.
 Creation praise will thunder to You.
 I'm lost in the wonder,
 Lost in the wonder of You.
 
[V2]
 Wisdom of ages,
 Light in the dark;
 Home for the outcast,
 Peace for the heart.
 Friend of the lonely,
 Strength for oppressed;
 Voice of the voiceless,
 God of all liberty.
