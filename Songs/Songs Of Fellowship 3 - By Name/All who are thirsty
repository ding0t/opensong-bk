[V1]
 All who are thirsty,
 All who are weak,
 Come to the fountain,
 Dip your heart in the stream of life.
 ||Let the pain and the sorrow
 Be washed away
 In the waves of His mercy,
 As deep cries out to deep.
 (We sing)
 
[V2]
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.
 
[V3]
 Holy Spirit come.
 Holy Spirit come.
 Holy Spirit come.
