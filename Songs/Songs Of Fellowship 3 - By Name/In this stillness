[V1]
 In this stillness I will worship, 
 Love You, Jesus, 
 I turn toward to kiss Your face. 
 I come running, thirsting, longing 
 For You, Jesus, 
 In the quiet of this place.
 Draw me closer to You, Jesus, 
 I would be with You.
 
[C]
 Risen Healer, conquering Saviour, 
 King of kings and Prince of Peace.
 Faithful Father, my Friend forever, 
 I will live to bring You praise. 
 
[V2]
 In Your presence I will bow down,
 Join with the angels 
 Singing 'Holy is Your name'.
 In this moment heaven's fragrance
 Touches earth and 
 I can feel Your kingdom come.
 Draw me closer to You, Jesus, 
 I would be with You.
