[V1]
 I come to You, Lord of all hope,
 Giver of life, revive my soul.
 I wait for You, Prince of all peace,
 King of all love, draw near to me.
 It feels sometimes like You're far away,
 Yet I know You are with me.
 
[C1]
 And I know I cannot go from Your presence, O Lord,
 But I need to feel You here with me.
 What can I do just to draw near to You?
 Oh, I need to know You here with me now.
 
[V2]
 Come to me now, Lord of my heart,
 I need to know unfailing love.
 Consuming flame, passion and power,
 Come let Your fire burn in me now.
 It feels sometimes like You're far away,
 Yet I know You are with me.
  
[C2]
 Where can I go just to find You, O God?
 Oh, I long to feel You holding me.
 Know that I seek You with all of my heart.
 Oh, I need to find You here with me now.
