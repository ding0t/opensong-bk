[V1]
 In You we live, Jesus, 
 In You we move.
 In You we breathe, Jesus, 
 In You we love. 
 And we are Your body here,
 We are Your body here.
 
[V2]
 Your touch - our hands,
 Your words - our voice,
 Your way - our feet,
 Your tears in our eyes,
 Your Spirit is here.
 
[V3]
 You give - we share,
 You lead - we go,
 You send - we serve,
 You build and we grow.
 Your Spirit is here.
 
[V4]
 Across the world, You're moving;
 The sound of prayer is growing stronger,
 From every tribe and nation
 Joining in one salvation song.
 
[V5]
 You are the light that's dawning,
 You are the hope transforming all things;
 Freeing the whole creation
 To join in one salvation song,
 One song.
