[V1]
 Everlasting, ever true,
 All creation sings to You.
 Ever faithful, living Lord,
 Let the sound of praise be heard.
 
[C]
 Jesus, You are
 All that I am living for
 And all that I believe is in You, Jesus,
 All that I am living for
 And all that I believe is in You.
 
[V2]
 Never changing, awesome God,
 Sing the glory of the Lord.
 Ever loving, holy One,
 I will praise what You have done.
