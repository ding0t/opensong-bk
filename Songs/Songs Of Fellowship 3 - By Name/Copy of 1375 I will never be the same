[V1]
 I will never be the same,
 Now that I have seen the cross;
 And how You took upon Yourself
 The fullness of the wrath of God.
 And I may never understand
 Just what You suffered in my place;
 Jesus, You who knew no sin,
 How You were made sin for us.
 
[V2]
 And oh, how fierce the Father's anger.
 And though You were pierced,
 All the pain could not compare;
 So dark was the hour, 
 When all heaven turned its face away,
 Turned its face away from You.
 But how sweet is Your mercy
 As it finds its way to me.
