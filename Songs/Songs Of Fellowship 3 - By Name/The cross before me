[V1]
 The cross before me, the world behind;
 No turning back, raise the banner high:
 It's not for me, it's all for You.
 ||Let the heavens shake and split the sky,
 Let the people clap their hands and cry:
 It's not for us, it's all for You.
 
[C]
 Not to us,
 But to Your name be the glory.
 Not to us,
 But to Your name be the glory.
 
[V2]
 Our hearts unfold before Your throne,
 The only place for those who know:
 It's not for us, it's all for You.
 ||Send Your holy fire on this offering,
 Let our worship burn for the world to see:
 It's not for us, it's all for You.
 
[V3]
 The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting:
 It's all for You.
 The waves are crashing, the sun is raging:
 It's all for You.
 
[V4]
 The universe spinning and singing:
 It's all for You.
 Your children dancing, dancing, dancing:
 It's all for You, it's all for You.
 My all for You, my all for You.
