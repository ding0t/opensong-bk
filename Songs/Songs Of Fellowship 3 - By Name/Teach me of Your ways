[V1]
 Teach me of Your ways,
 To honour You with all I have,
 And that I learn to say:
 'Not my will, but Yours, my Lord.'
 
[C]
 O Jesus, be glorified
 In all of my life.
 It's all about You,
 And the worship You're due.
 So help me to change,
 Mould me like clay;
 Lord, have Your way,
 Lord, have Your way with me.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I long to be
 A faithful child who honours You.
 So Jesus, be in me,
 Let Your light shine through me now.
