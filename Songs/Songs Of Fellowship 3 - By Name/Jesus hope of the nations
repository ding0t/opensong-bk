[V1]
 Jesus, hope of the nations;
 Jesus, comfort for all who mourn,
 You are the source 
 Of heaven's hope on earth.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, light in the darkness,
 Jesus, truth in each circumstance,
 You are the source 
 Of heaven's light on earth.
 
[V3]
 In history, You lived and died,
 You broke the chains, You rose to life.
 
[C]
 You are the Hope, living in us,
 You are the Rock, in whom we trust.
 You are the Light, 
 Shining for all the world to see.
 ||You rose from the dead, conquering fear,
 Our Prince of Peace, drawing us near.
 Jesus, our Hope, 
 Living for all who will receive,
 Lord, we believe.
