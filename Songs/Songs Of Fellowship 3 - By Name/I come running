[V1]
 I come running to You, Father, 
 Trying to find a secret place with You. 
 My soul crying out, just to hear Your voice, 
 Oh, I must have You. 
 
[V2]
 I come running to You, Jesus, 
 I'm so hungry for Your truth. 
 I've found many treasures 
 Hidden in Your word, 
 But I must have You. 
 
[C]
 Only You, Lord, will I worship, 
 Only You will I serve. 
 And my hope lies in You, Lord, 
 Only You can make me whole. 
 And I will say 'I love You.' 
 Yes, I will sing to You, to You.
 
[V3]
 I come longing for You, Spirit,
 So dry I need to know Your touch.
 I know living waters deep within me,
 But I must have more of You.
