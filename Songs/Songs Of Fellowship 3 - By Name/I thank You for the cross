[V1]
 I thank You for the cross
 Where all my shame was laid,
 Broken by Your power,
 Banished to the grave.
 You gave Yourself for me,
 A sinner for a King,
 Offering Your death
 And suffering my sin.
 
[V2]
 And I will give my life
 To You, Lord,
 For with grace You came
 To pay the ransom for my soul.
 And I will live my life
 For You, Lord.
 You brought me back from death,
 Into Your mercy on the cross.
