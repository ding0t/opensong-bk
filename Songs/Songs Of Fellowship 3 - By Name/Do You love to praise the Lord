[V1]
 Do You love to praise the Lord? (echo)
 Do you love to praise the Lord? (echo)
 Lift your voices high,
 Raise your hands to the sky.
 Make a joyful noise!
 
[V2]
 Do You love to praise the Lord? (echo)
 Do you love to praise the Lord? (echo)
 Lift your voices high,
 Raise your hands to the sky.
 Everybody dance!
 
[C]
 Praise Him in the dance,
 Everybody dance!
 Praise Him in the dance,
 Everybody dance!
 
[V3]
 We have come to praise the Lord. (echo)
 We have come to praise the Lord. (echo)
 Lift our voices high, 
 Raise our hands to the sky,
 Make a joyful noise!
 
[V4]
 We have come to praise the Lord. (echo)
 We have come to praise the Lord. (echo)
 Lift our voices high, 
 Raise our hands to the sky,
 Then we're gonna dance!
 
[V5]
 We love to praise the Lord;
 It's what we're made for.
 We love to praise the Lord;
 It's in our nature.
 We love to praise the Lord,
 It's deep within us.
 We love to praise the Lord
 With everything that's in us 
 We wiLl dance!
