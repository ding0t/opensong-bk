[V1]
 Like a fragrant oil,
 Like costly perfume poured out,
 Let my worship be to You.
 Like a fervent prayer,
 Like incense rising to Your throne,
 In spirit and in truth.
 
[C]
 Jesus, 
 You alone are worthy of my praise,
 I owe my life to You.
 Jesus, 
 You alone can make me holy,
 So I bow before You.
 
[V2]
 Like a wedding vow,
 'All I am I give to You',
 Let my sacrifice be pure.
 Like the sweetest sound,
 Like a lover's whisper in Your ear,
 I've set my heart on You.
