[V1]
 Forth in thy name, O Lord, I go,
 My daily labour to pursue,
 Thee, only Thee, resolved to know
 In all I think, or speak, or do.
 
[V2]
 The task Thy wisdom hath assigned
 O let me cheerfully fulfil;
 In all my works Thy presence find,
 And prove Thy acceptable will.
 
[V3]
 Thee may I set at my right hand,
 Whose eyes my inmost substance see;
 And labour on at Thy command,
 And offer all my works to Thee.
 
[V4]
 Give me to bear Thy easy yoke,
 And every moment watch and pray,
 And still to things eternal look,
 And hasten to Thy glorious day.
 
[V5]
 For Thee delightfully employ
 Whate'er Thy bounteous grace hath given,
 And run my course with even joy,
 And closely walk with Thee to heaven.
