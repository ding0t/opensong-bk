[V1]
 Wonderful Redeemer all my life,
 Thank You for the grace You have shown to me.
 Nothing can compare to Your heart of love,
 I have Your eyes.
 
[C]
 Sing to the Lord our God,
 Lift up His name and exalt Him.
 Your holiness is immense,
 And we Your people will worship
 Your name forever.
 
[V2]
 Righteous and majestic King of truth,
 All mankind will one day bow the knee to You.
 May our lives reflect the heart of You, O Lord, 
 We will live for You.
