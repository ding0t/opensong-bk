[V1]
 You came into my life, 
 A Saviour to my soul;
 You set a hope within this heart of mine. 
 You said that I am Yours, 
 That You will never leave me.
 Now I surrender all I am to You. 
 
[V2]
 I will never know why You chose me, God, 
 But You did. 
 I will never know why You took that cross, 
 But You did, yes, You did. 
 
[C]
 While today is still today 
 I'll live just for Your praise, 
 A living sacrifice;
 Holding out to be 
 Faithful unto You,
 So in my life be glorified, 
 I pray.
 
[V3]
 In You, O Lord, I trust,
 In You, O Lord, I live;
 Do not let me stray from Your commands.
 Guide me in Your way, 
 Protect me in Your truth,
 Teach me what it means to follow You.
