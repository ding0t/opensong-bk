[V1]
 We have this treasure in jars of clay.
 For all our frailty, You have entrusted us
 To shine Your goodness
 And life throughout the nations.
 ||We may be pressed hard from every side,
 But we will not be crushed,
 Your hope will strengthen us.
 And when the hard times squeeze so tight,
 May they release more
 Of the fragrance of Jesus.
 
[C]
 And let Your glory shine,
 O let Your glory shine.
 O let Your glory shine
 Through our lives, by Your grace,
 May we overflow with Jesus.
 
[V2]
 May we shine like, may we shine like,
 May we shine like stars in the darkness.
 May we shine like, may we shine like,
 May we shine like stars.
