[V1]
 There is a day
 That all creation's waiting for,
 A day of freedom and liberation for the earth.
 And on that day 
 The Lord will come to meet His bride,
 And when we see Him 
 In an instant we'll be changed.
 
[V2]
 The trumpet sounds 
 And the dead will then be raised
 By His power,
 Never to perish again.
 Once only flesh,
 Now clothed with immortality;
 Death has now been
 Swallowed up in victory.
 
[C]
 We will meet Him in the air
 And then we will be like Him,
 For we will see Him, as He is,
 Oh yeah!
 Then all hurt and pain will cease,
 And we'll be with Him forever,
 And in His glory we will live,
 Oh yeah, oh yeah!
 
[V3]
 So lift your eyes
 To the things as yet unseen,
 That will remain now
 For all eternity.
 Though trouble's hard
 It's only momentary,
 And it's achieving
 Our future glory.
