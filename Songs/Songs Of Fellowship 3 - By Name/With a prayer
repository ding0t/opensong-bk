[V1]
 With a prayer You fed the hungry,
 With a cry You stilled the storm;
 With a look You had compassion 
 On the desperate and forlorn.
 With a touch You healed the leper,
 With a shout You raised the dead;
 With a word expelled the demons,
 With a blessing broke the bread.
 
[C]
 Love incarnate, love divine,
 Captivate this heart of mine
 Till all I do speaks of You.
 
[V2]
 As a sheep before the shearer
 You were silent in Your pain;
 You endured humiliation
 At the hands of those You'd made.
 And as hell unleashed its fury
 You were lifted on a tree,
 Crying 'Father God, forgive them,
 Place their punishment on Me.'
 
[V3]
 I will feed the poor and hungry,
 I will stand up for the truth;
 I will take my cross and follow
 To the corners of the earth.
 And I ask that You so fill me
 With Your peace, Your power, Your breath,
 That I never love my life so much
 To shrink from facing death.
