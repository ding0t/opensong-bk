[V1]
 I'm crying out, let everybody hear
 This message loud and clear.
 I'm crying out, I want the world to know
 That Jesus is my hope.
 
[V2]
 I've chosen to believe
 That God has chosen me 
 Now at this time.
 He turned my life around,
 I make a different sound, 
 Now I want to be a sign.
 ||Harvest fields are white, 
 Wanna do what's right,
 Can't keep it to myself,
 Gotta go, gotta tell everyone, yeah.
