[V1]
 Soldiers of our God, arise!
 The day is drawing nearer;
 Shake the slumber from your eyes, 
 The light is growing clearer.
 Sit no longer idly by
 While the heedless millions die.
 O, lift the blood-stained banner high,
 And take the field for Jesus.
 
[C]
 Save the lost! Save the lost!
 Spend your might for them;
 Give your life for them.
 Save the lost! Save the lost!
 Don't back down on it;
 Win your crown in it,
 Soldiers of our God,
 Soldiers of our God.
 
[V2]
 See the brazen hosts of hell
 Their art and power employing,
 More than human tongue can tell 
 The blood-bought souls destroying.
 See on ruin's hell-bound road
 Victims groan beneath their load;
 Go forward, O you sons of God,
 And dare or die for Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Warriors of the risen King,
 Great army of salvation,
 Spread His fame, His praises sing
 And conquer every nation.
 Raise the glorious standard higher,
 Work for victory, never tire;
 O, forward march with blood and fire,
 And win the world for Jesus.
