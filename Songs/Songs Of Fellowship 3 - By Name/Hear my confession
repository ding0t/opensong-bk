[V1]
 Hear my confession in Your compassion;
 Could You lead me in the way that I should go?
 If I lose my life for You, I know I'll find it;
 Could Your will become incarnate in my soul?
 
[V2]
 For I would rather learn to open doors in Your house,
 Than spend the rest of my days wasted somewhere else.
 For I could never be free or feel Your peace
 Till I surrender to Your love.
 
[C]
 Take my whole heart;
 I won't hold back the least part.
 I wanna fall face forward
 Into the arms of grace.
 Oh, may my passion become so undivided
 That I won't be satisfied with nothing less,
 Nothing less than You.
 
[V3]
 Could You give me a hunger for Your kingdom,
 That my own desires would all take second place?
