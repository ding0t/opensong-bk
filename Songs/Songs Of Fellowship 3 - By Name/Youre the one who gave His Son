[V1]
 You're the one who gave His Son,
 Who will freely give us all things,
 And nothing can be against us
 If God is still for us.
 ||And all things work for good
 For those who love the Lord,
 And nothing can be against us
 When You are still for us.
 
[V2]
 And we're convinced 
 That neither death nor life,
 Angels or demons,
 Height nor depths, nor what's to come
 Can cut us off from the love of God.
 
[C]
 God is still for us, God is still for us,
 God is still for us, turn around.
 He is still for us, God is still for us,
 God is still for us, turn around.
 
[V3]
 When hardship or danger comes,
 We know that God gave His only Son.
 So as a body we are assured
 That God is still for us.
 ||We look to You, Lord, 
 We stand on Your word;
 We're holding on 
 To the promise You've made â€“
 That nothing can be against us
 When You are still for us.
