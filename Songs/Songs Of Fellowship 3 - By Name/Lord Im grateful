[V1]
 Lord, I'm grateful, 
 Amazed at what You've done.
 My finest efforts are filthy rags;
 But I'm made righteous 
 By trusting in the Son:
 I have God's riches at Christ's expense!
 
[C]
 'Cause it's grace!
 There's nothing I can do 
 To make You love me more,
 To make You love me less than You do.
 ||And by faith 
 I'm standing on this Stone 
 Of Christ and Christ alone,
 Your righteousness is all that I need,
 'Cause it's grace!
 
[V2]
 Called and chosen when I was far away,
 You brought me into Your family.
 Free, forgiven, my guilt is washed away;
 Your loving kindness is life to me.
 
[V3]
 Grace loves the sinner,
 Loves all I am and all I'll ever be;
 Makes me a winner
 Whatever lies the devil throws at me.
 
[V4]
 Freely given, but bought with priceless blood,
 My life was ransomed at Calvary.
 There my Jesus gave everything He could
 That I might live for eternity.
