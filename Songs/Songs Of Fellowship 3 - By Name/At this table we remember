[V1]
 At this table we remember
 How and where our faith began:
 In the pain of crucifixion
 Suffered by the Son of Man.
 
[V2]
 Looking up in adoration
 Faith is conscious - He is here!
 Christ is present with His people,
 His the call that draws us near.
 
[V3]
 Heart and mind we each examine:
 If with honesty we face
 All our doubt, our fear and failure,
 Then we can receive His grace.
 
[V4]
 Peace we share with one another:
 As from face to face we turn
 In our brothers and our sisters
 Jesus&apos; body we discern.
 
[V5]
 Bread and wine are set before us;
 As we eat, we look ahead:
 We shall dine with Christ in heaven
 Where the kingdom feast is spread.
 
[V6]
 Nourished by the bread of heaven,
 Faith and strength and courage grow - 
 So to witness, serve and suffer,
 Out into the world we go.
