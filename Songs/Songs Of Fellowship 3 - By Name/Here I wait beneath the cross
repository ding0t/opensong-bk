[V1]
 Here I wait beneath the cross,
 Resting in the presence of Your love.
 Here I wait to know Your heart,
 As I worship You in spirit and in truth.
 
[V2]
 For You are my God,
 You are my King,
 You reveal deep within to my very soul.
 For You alone are
 
[C]
 Jesus, there's no other name,
 Jesus, eternally the same,
 Jesus, the King of kings.
 Jesus, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend,
 Jesus, faithful till the end,
 Jesus, the King of kings.
 
[V3]
 Here I come to give my all,
 My hands reach up in holy praise to You.
 Here I cast all chains aside
 To worship You in spirit and in truth.
