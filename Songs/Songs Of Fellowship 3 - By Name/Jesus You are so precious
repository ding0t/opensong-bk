[V1]
 Jesus, You are so precious to me;
 To behold You is all I desire. 
 Seated in glory, now and forever, 
 My Jesus, my Saviour, my Lord. 
 
[C]
 I worship You, 
 I worship You, 
 Lord, I worship You, 
 Yes, I worship You.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, You are so precious to me;
 Your beauty has captured my gaze.
 Now I will come and bow down before You,
 And pour sweet perfume on Your feet.
