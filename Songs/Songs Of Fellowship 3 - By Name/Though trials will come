[V1]
 Though trials will come,
 Don't fear, don't run.
 Lift up your eyes,
 Hold fast, be strong.
 Have faith, keep on believing.
 ||Lift up your eyes
 For God is at work in us,
 Moulding and shaping us
 Out of His love for us,
 Making us more like Jesus.
 
[C]
 Consider it joy, pure joy
 When troubles come.
 Many trials will make you strong.
 Consider it joy, pure joy
 And stand your ground,
 Then at last you'll wear a crown.
 
[V2]
 Though trials will come,
 Won't fear, won't run.
 We'll lift up our eyes,
 Hold fast, be strong.
 Have faith, keep on believing.
 ||We'll lift up our eyes
 For God is at work in us,
 Moulding and shaping us
 Out of His love for us,
 Making us more like Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Joy, pure joy,
 Consider it joy, pure joy.
 Joy, pure joy,
 Consider it joy, pure joy.
 
[V4]
 Patiently trusting Him,
 Ready for anything,
 Till we're complete in Him,
 In everything more like Jesus.
