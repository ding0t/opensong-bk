[V1]
 We are called to be prophets to this nation, 
 To be the word of God in every situation; 
 Change my heart, change my heart today. 
 ||Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour? 
 Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour? 
 Change my heart, change my heart today. 
 
[V2]
 Lord, loose the chains of oppression; 
 Lord, set the captives free. 
 Lord, fill my heart with compassion: 
 Shine Your light, shine Your light, 
 Shine Your light through me. 
 
[C]
 Work a miracle in my heart, 
 Work a miracle in my heart, 
 Work a miracle in my heart, 
 O Lord, today. 
 
[V3]
 Lord, take all of my lies and take all of my greed;
 Let me be a sacrifice for those who are in need.
 Change my heart, change my heart today.
 ||Lord, without Your power it's all just good intentions;
 Lord, without Your grace who could find redemption?
 Change my heart, change my heart today.
