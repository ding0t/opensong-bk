[V1]
 All my life, all my will, every day,
 I lay it all before You.
 All my life, all my will, every day,
 I lay it all before You now.
 
[C]
 And Jesus takes us to the place of true surrender,
 Where we become less and You become greater;
 And Your holy ways into our lives will enter,
 And all that we are, and all that we have become Yours.
 
[V2]
 All my pain, all the fears, every tear,
 I lay them all before You.
 All my pain, all the fears, every tear,
 I lay them all before You now.
