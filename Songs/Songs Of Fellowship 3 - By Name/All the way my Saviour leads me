[V1]
 All the way my Saviour leads me,
 What have I to ask beside?
 Can I doubt His tender mercy,
 Who through life has been my guide?
 Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
 Here by faith in Him to dwell,
 For I know whate&apos;er befall me,
 Jesus doeth all things well.
 
[V2]
 All the way my Saviour leads me,
 Cheers each winding path I tread.
 Gives me grace for every trial,
 Feeds me with the Living Bread.
 Though my weary steps may falter
 And my soul athirst may be,
 Gushing from a Rock before me,
 Lo! a spring of joy I see.
 
[C]
 And all the way my Saviour leads me,
 Oh, the fullness of His love.
 Perfect rest to me is promised
 In my Father&apos;s house above.
 And when my spirit clothed immortal
 Wings its flight to realms of day,
 This my song through endless ages,
 Jesus led me all the way.
