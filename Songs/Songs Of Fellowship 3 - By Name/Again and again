[V1]
 Again and again,
 You have revealed Your love to me.
 Again and again grace has shone through.
 You've always been there for me 
 When I have come to You:
 You are the Rock on which I stand.
 
[C]
 You're wonderful, You're marvellous,
 You're everything to me.
 Your steadfast and unchanging love
 Are all I'll ever need.
 What peace and what security
 Can be found in knowing You,
 My Healer, Deliverer.
 
[V2]
 There is no limit to this never-ending stream
 That's entered the castle of my soul.
 You give me a hope and future 
 Beyond my wildest dreams.
 Your love is greater than I know.
 
[V3]
 You've been my fortress
 Through the shifting sands of time;
 In change and adversity
 You have answered my prayer to guide me.
