[V1]
 Come, see this glorious light 
 As it shines on you, 
 Bringing grace and peace 
 To the depths of your soul. 
 ||Come, see the wounds of love, 
 Scars that make you whole, 
 Blood that paid the price 
 For the sins of the world.
 He is the Light everlasting,
 He is the First and the Last. 
 
[C]
 Blessing and honour and glory and power, 
 Blessing and honour and glory and power, 
 Blessing and honour and glory and power 
 To You, Lord, 
 You're the King of the Ages.
 ||Justice and truth are the marks of Your reign, 
 Angels adore You, the Lamb who was slain, 
 They're crying 'holy' again and again, 
 Lord Jesus, 
 You're the King of the Ages.
 
[V2]
 Come, all you thirsty and poor,
 Come and feast on Him,
 That your souls may live
 And be satisfied.
 ||Come from the ends of the earth,
 Every tribe and tongue,
 Lift your voice and praise
 Your eternal Reward.
 He's the Desire of the nations,
 He is the Faithful and True.
