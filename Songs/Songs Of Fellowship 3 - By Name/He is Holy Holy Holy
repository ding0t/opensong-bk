[C]
 He is Holy, Holy, Holy,
 My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus.
 Give glory, glory, glory to the Son,
 Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!
 
[V1]
 We're gonna give Him praise,
 And His name we'll raise 
 As we celebrate with Jesus.
 Let our voices sing to the King of kings,
 Who was and is to come.
 
[V2]
 He's the Prince of Peace
 And He will release
 All the chains that keep you down.
 He's the Son of Man,
 He's the Great I Am,
 He's the mighty Lamb of heaven!
 
[V3]
 He's the God of grace,
 And if we seek His face
 He'll demonstrate His power.
 On the final day unto the bride He'll say:
 'At My side you'll stay forever and ever.'
