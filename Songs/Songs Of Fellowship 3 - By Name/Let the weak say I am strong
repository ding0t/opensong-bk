[V1]
 Let the weak say I am strong,
 Let the poor say I am rich,
 Let the blind say I can see,
 It's what the Lord has done in me. 
 (Repeat)
 
[C]
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain;
 Hosanna, hosanna,
 Jesus died and rose again.
 
[V2]
 Into the river I will wade, 
 There my sins are washed away;
 From the heavens mercy streams 
 Of the Saviour's love for me.
 
[V3]
 I will rise from waters deep
 Into the saving arms of God;
 I will sing salvation songs:
 Jesus Christ has set me free.
