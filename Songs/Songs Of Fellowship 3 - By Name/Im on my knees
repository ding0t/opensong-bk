[V1]
 I'm on my knees at the cross,
 Where Your blood was sacrificed;
 So amazed that there is grace
 Enough for me.
 I don't deserve the love You bring,
 But I'm at that place again,
 Where I need You
 To forgive my foolish heart.
 
[V2]
 Oh, what mercy,
 Oh, what mercy,
 Oh, what mercy
 Is mine to receive.
