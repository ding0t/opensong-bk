[V1]
 When You prayed beneath the trees,
 It was for me, O Lord;
 When You cried upon Your knees,
 How could it be, O Lord?
 When in blood and sweat and tears
 You dismissed Your final fears,
 When You faced the soldiers' spears,
 You stood for me, O Lord.
 
[V2]
 When their triumph looked complete,
 It was for me, O Lord;
 When it seemed like Your defeat,
 They could not see, O Lord!
 When You faced the mob alone
 You were silent as a stone,
 And a tree became Your throne;
 You came for me, O Lord.
 
[V3]
 When You stumbled up the road,
 You walked for me, O Lord,
 When You took Your deadly load,
 That heavy tree, O Lord;
 When they lifted You on high,
 And they nailed You up to die,
 And when darkness filled the sky,
 It was for me, O Lord.
 
[V4]
 When You spoke with kingly power,
 It was for me, O Lord,
 In that dread and destined hour,
 You made me free, O Lord;
 Earth and heaven heard You shout,
 Death and hell were put to rout,
 For the grave could not hold out;
 You are for me, O Lord.
