[V1]
 Now has come salvation,
 Now has come Your strength,
 And the kingdom of my God,
 And the power of His Christ,
 Jesus, holy One,
 Jesus, holy One.
 
[C]
 You are the One that I love, my Lord,
 You are the One all of heaven adores.
 You are the One who is high
 Over all the earth.
 Jesus, my risen Saviour,
 Jesus, my risen Saviour.
 
[V2]
 Now has come Your mercy,
 Now has come Your peace,
 And the glory of Your presence,
 And the greatness of Your name,
 Jesus, holy One,
 Jesus, holy One.
 
[V3]
 Now has come forgiveness,
 Now has come Your grace,
 And the precious Holy Spirit,
 And the freedom that You gave
 In Jesus, holy One, 
 Jesus, holy One.
