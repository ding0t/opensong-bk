[V1]
 Through days of rage and wonder
 We pursue the end of time, 
 To seize the day eternal,
 The reign of love divine.
 
[V2]
 Fixing our eyes on Jesus, 
 We will press on day by day.
 This world's vain passing pleasures
 Are not our destiny.
 
[C]
 Our ancient rites of passage
 Still are the bread and wine:
 Our hope a cross that towers
 Over the wrecks of time.
 
[V3]
 Through days of rage and wonder, 
 By the awesome power of prayer
 God will shake every nation, 
 Secrets will be laid bare.
 And if His light increasing 
 Casts deeper shadows here,
 Safe in His holy presence, 
 Love will cast out our fear.
 
[V4]
 Through days of rage and wonder, 
 You will give us strength to stand
 And seek a heavenly city 
 Not built by human hands.
 Now is the only moment 
 Within our power to change:
 To give back in obedience 
 While life and breath remain.
