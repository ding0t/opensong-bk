[V1]
 You are my Shepherd, I have no needs.
 You lead me by peaceful streams,
 And You refresh my life.
 You hold my hand and You guide my steps,
 I could walk through the valley of death,
 And I won't be afraid.
 
[V2]
 Because You are in control.
 You are in control.
 You are in control.
 You are in control.
 
[V3]
 You cause everything to work together,
 You truly have a sovereign plan,
 And You know who I am,
 And You made who I am,
 And You love who I am.
