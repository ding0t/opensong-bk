[V1]
 Let there be joy, let there be peace,
 Let there be power, let there be praise.
 Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.
 ||It was for freedom that we were set free,
 Let every mountain be cast to the sea.
 Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.
 
[V2]
 We will declare it to the heavens,
 The righteousness of God in which we stand.
 We will proclaim it to the nations;
 Every eye shall see, every ear shall hear,
 Every heart will understand.
