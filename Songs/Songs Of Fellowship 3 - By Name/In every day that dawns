[V1]
 In every day that dawns,
 I see the light of Your splendour around me;
 And everywhere I turn,
 I know the gift of Your favour upon me.
 What can I do but give You glory, Lord?
 Everything good has come from You.
 
[C]
 I'm grateful for the air I breathe,
 I'm so thankful for this life I live,
 For the mercies that You pour on me,
 And the blessings that meet every need.
 ||And the grace that is changing me
 From a hopeless case to a child that's free,
 Free to give You praise,
 For in everything
 I know You love me.
 I know You love me.
 
[V2]
 Through all that I have known,
 I have been held in the shelter of Your hand;
 And as my life unfolds,
 You are revealing the wisdom 
 Of Your sovereign plan.
 There are no shadows in Your faithfulness,
 There are no limits to Your love.
