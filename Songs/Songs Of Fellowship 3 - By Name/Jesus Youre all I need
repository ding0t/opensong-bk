[V1]
 Jesus, You're all I need, 
 You're all I need. 
 Now I give my life to You alone, 
 You are all I need.
 Jesus, You're all I need,
 You're all I need.
 Lord, You gave Yourself so I could live,
 You are all I need.
 
[V2]
 Oh, You purchased my salvation, 
 And wiped away my tears; 
 Now I drink Your living water, 
 And I'll never thirst again. 
 For You alone are holy, 
 I'll worship at Your throne; 
 And You will reign forever, 
 Holy is the Lord.
