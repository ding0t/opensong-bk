[C1]
 We're gonna sing like the saved.
 We're gonna sing like the saved.
 We're gonna sing like the saved.
 We're gonna sing like the saved.
 
[V1]
 It is our duty and our joy,
 In every time and every place,
 Your gates we'll enter to give thanks,
 Your courts we'll run into with praise.
 
[C2]
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 
[C3]
 You put Your joy in our hearts
 You put Your joy in our hearts
 You put Your joy in our hearts
 You put Your joy in our hearts
 
[C4]
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 We're gonna dance like the saved
