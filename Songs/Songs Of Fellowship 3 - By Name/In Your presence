[V1]
 In Your presence there is fullness of life,
 And healing flowing for body, soul and mind.
 God of miracles, God of the impossible is here,
 God is here.
 
[C]
 God is here, let the broken-hearted rejoice.
 God is here, let the sick say 'I am well.'
 God is here, let the weak say 'I am strong.'
 God is here, His wonders to perform.
 
[V2]
 In Your presence there is perfect peace;
 In the stillness I behold Your deity.
 God of wonder, God of power is here,
 God is here.
 
[V3]
 Oh, His wonders, yes, His wonders,
 His wonders to perform.
 Oh, His wonders, yes, His wonders,
 His wonders to perform.
 (Repeat)
