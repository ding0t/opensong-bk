[V1]
 Lord of the church,
 We pray for our renewing:
 Christ over all, our undivided aim;
 Fire of the Spirit, burn for our enduing,
 Wind of the Spirit, fan the living flame!
 ||We turn to Christ amid our fear and failing,
 The will that lacks the courage to be free,
 The weary labours, all but unavailing,
 To bring us nearer what a church should be.
 
[V2]
 Lord of the Church, we seek a Father's blessing,
 A true repentance and a faith restored,
 A swift obedience and a new possessing,
 Filled with the Holy Spirit of the Lord!
 ||We turn to Christ from all our restless striving,
 Unnumbered voices with a single prayer - 
 The living water for our souls' reviving,
 In Christ to live, and love and serve and care.
 
[V3]
 Lord of the Church, we long for our uniting,
 True to one calling, by one vision stirred;
 One cross proclaiming and one creed reciting,
 One in the truth of Jesus and His word!
 ||So lead us on; till toil and trouble ended,
 One Church triumphant one new song shall sing,
 To praise His glory, risen and ascended,
 Christ over all, the everlasting King!
