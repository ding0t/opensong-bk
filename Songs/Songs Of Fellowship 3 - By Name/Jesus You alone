[V1]
 Jesus, You alone shall be 
 My first love, my first love. 
 The secret place and highest praise 
 Shall be Yours, shall be Yours. 
 
[V2]
 To Your throne I'll bring devotion, 
 May it be the sweetest sound: 
 Lord, this heart is reaching for You now. 
 
[C]
 So I'll set my sights upon You, 
 Set my life upon Your praise; 
 Never looking to another way. 
 (Second time)
 You alone will be my passion, 
 Jesus, You will be my song: 
 You will find me longing after You.
 
[V3]
 Day and night I lift my eyes 
 To seek You, to seek You,
 Hungry for a glimpse of You 
 In glory, in glory.
