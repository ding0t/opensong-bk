[V1]
 There's a pageant of triumph in glory,
 As Jesus the King takes His throne.
 The shame of the cross is exchanged for a crown, 
 And heaven applauds the King. 
 ||The Son has the Father's approval, 
 He perfectly followed the plan
 To suffer and die for the sins of the world, 
 He poured out His love for our shame. 
 
[C]
 Let God arise with shouts of joy, 
 With songs of praise and trumpet sound; 
 Let music play and hearts be free, 
 Let God arise!
 
[V2]
 Death could not keep Him in prison,
 He burst through the shackles of hell;
 He settled the score with the evil one,
 And heaven applauds the King.
 ||The fullness of Christ is my treasure,
 I've cast off the past with its shame.
 The power of the Father has raised me to life,
 I'm a son, I'm forgiven and free.
