[V1]
 You are mystical and deep.
 You take Your rest, but never sleep.
 You watch me like a mother does,
 Every scar and every tear and fall.
 ||You suffer long, but Your patience waits,
 Your judgement always hesitates.
 Your anger stays a moment,
 Yet Your favour lasts a whole life long.
 
[V2]
 And I cannot stand silently
 When faced with so much grace.
 My chest is pounding with the need
 To celebrate You, God,
 And the miracle of Your love.
 
[C]
 For You're everywhere, in every place,
 In every time, in every space,
 And every breath that I take You lend.
 You're the only One who satisfies,
 The only One who makes my life make sense.
 
[V3]
 You are generous and kind,
 So intimate and close at times,
 Yet You reveal Your beauty in the twilight
 And the summer evening rain.
 ||You're in the rainbow and the dawn,
 You steal my breath and then You're gone,
 Yet when the morning sun breaks through,
 I look for You and You are here again.
