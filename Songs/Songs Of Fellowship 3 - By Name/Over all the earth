[V1]
 Over all the earth, 
 You reign on high,
 Every mountain stream,
 Every sunset sky.
 But my one request,
 Lord, my only aim
 Is that You'd reign in me again.
 
[C]
 Lord, reign in me,
 Reign in Your power;
 Over all my dreams, 
 In my darkest hour.
 You are the Lord of all I am,
 So won't You reign in me again?
 
[V2]
 Over every thought,
 Over every word,
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord;
 'Cause You mean more to me
 Than any earthly thing,
 So won't You reign in me again?
 
</lyrics></song>
