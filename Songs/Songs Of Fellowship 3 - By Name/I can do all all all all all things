[C]
 I can do all (all!), all (all!), all things
 Through Christ who strengthens me.
 I can do all (all!), all (all!), all things
 Through Christ who strengthens me.
 
[V1]
 Go to school: all things.
 Obey the rules: all things.
 Keep my cool: all things 
 Through Christ who strengthens me.
 
[V2]
 Make new friends: all things.
 Give and lend: all things.
 Make amends: all things
 Through Christ who strengthens me.
 
[V3]
 Pray and sing: all things.
 Love our King: all things.
 Everything: all things
 Through Christ who strengthens me.
