[V1]
 May my eyes see more of You, Lord;
 May my heart just beat with Yours. 
 May my hope be in Your goodness, 
 May my life be pure. 
 And every day my cry is just the same: 
 Make me like Jesus, Lord, I pray. 
 
[C1]
 Because You've captured my heart, 
 You have captured my heart. 
 King of love, and King of glory, 
 Author of creation's story, 
 I delight in You, and now and forever.
 ||You have captured my heart, 
 You have captured my heart. 
 I delight in You, You've captured my heart. 
 
[C2]
 Because You've captured my heart, 
 You have captured my heart.
 In Your throne room there will be 
 No hiding place in purity, 
 A life laid bare for all to see, 
 O God, make me holy. 
 ||You have captured my heart, 
 You have captured my heart. 
 I delight in You, You've captured my heart.
