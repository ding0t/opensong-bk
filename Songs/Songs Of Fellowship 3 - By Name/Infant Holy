[V1]
 Infant Holy, Infant lowly, 
 For His bed a cattle stall;
 Oxen lowing, little knowing, 
 Christ the babe is Lord of all.
 Swift are winging angels singing, 
 Nowells ringing, tidings bringing:
 Christ the babe is Lord of all;
 Christ the babe is Lord of all.
 
[V2]
 Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping 
 Vigil till the morning new;
 Saw the glory, heard the story, 
 Tidings of a gospel true.
 Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, 
 Praises voicing, greet the morrow:
 Christ the babe was born for you!
 Christ the babe was born for you!
