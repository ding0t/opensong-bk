[V1]
 This is the best place,
 This is the right place,
 And we have confidence now to enter:
 Let us draw near now, 
 With hearts sincere now,
 In full assurance,
 To worship Jesus.
 
[C]
 We're worshipping the living God!
 We're worshipping the living God!
 We're worshipping the living God!
 We're worshipping the living God!
 
[V2]
 Let us consider,
 For one another,
 The way to love more,
 As the day approaches.
 Let us draw near now,
 With hearts sincere now;
 Let's meet together
 To worship Jesus.
