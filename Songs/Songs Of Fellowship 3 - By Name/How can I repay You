[V1]
 How can I repay You, Lord,
 For all You've done for me?
 Nothing I can say or do
 Will ever be enough.
 
[C]
 I will live for You,
 Walking in Your way,
 Lifting high Your name,
 Holding close the cross.
 Not in words alone,
 But in what I do,
 I will live my life for You.
 
[V2]
 Dear Lord, Your heart is drawing me,
 A calling from Your throne.
 And in my brokenness I come
 And whisper to You, Lord.
 
[V3]
 It's not by works, but by Your grace,
 I'll never earn Your love.
 You loved me first, You'll love me last,
 Your cross, my only hope.
