[V1]
 Who's the only light that shines and never fades?
 The Light of the world, Jesus.
 Who's the only light that drives the dark away?
 The Light of the world, Jesus.
 
[C]
 It's all about Jesus, Jesus,
 It's all about Jesus, Jesus.
 
[V2]
 Who's the only Word that made all things?
 The Word was God, Jesus.
 He's the only truth, the fullness of the Lord,
 The Son of God, Jesus.
 
[V3]
 You're the Way, the Truth and the Life.
 You're the Way, the Truth and the Life.
