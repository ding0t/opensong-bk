[V1]
 I'm gonna trust in God, 
 I'm gonna trust in Jesus 
 Without shame and without fear. 
 I'm gonna fix my eyes 
 On the hope of glory, 
 For His day is drawing near. 
 
[C]
 How great is the love of God, 
 How steady is His hand 
 To guide me through this world. 
 And though I am weak, in Him I stand, 
 And you will hear me say today, 
 In faith, I'm gonna trust in God.
 
[V2]
 Now when the cares of life 
 Seem overwhelming,
 And my heart is sinking down,
 I'm gonna lift my hands 
 To the One who'll help me,
 To the One who holds my crown.
