[V1]
 My hope rests firm on Jesus Christ,
 He is my only plea:
 Though all the world should point and scorn,
 His ransom leaves me free,
 His ransom leaves me free.
 
[V2]
 My hope sustains me as I strive
 And strain towards the goal;
 Though I still stumble into sin,
 His death paid for it all,
 His death paid for it all.
 
[V3]
 My hope provides me with a spur
 To help me run this race:
 I know my tears will turn to joy
 The day I see His face,
 The day I see His face.
 
[V4]
 My hope is to be with my Lord,
 To know as I am known:
 To serve Him gladly all my days
 In praise before His throne,
 In praise before His throne.
