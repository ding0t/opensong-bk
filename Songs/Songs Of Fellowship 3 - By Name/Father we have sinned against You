[V1]
 Father, we have sinned against You,
 Failed to do what's right;
 We have walked alone in darkness,
 Hiding from the light.
 Father, we have run away
 From what we know is true;
 Now we turn around and we are
 Coming home to You.
 
[V2]
 We have sinned, (we have sinned)
 We have broken Your law,
 We're returning once more home to You;
 We have sinned, (we have sinned)
 We are seeking Your face,
 We return by Your grace home to You.
