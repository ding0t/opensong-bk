[V1]
 I know not why God's wondrous grace 
 To me hath been made known; 
 Nor why, unworthy as I am, 
 He claimed me for His own.
 
[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith 
 To me He did impart; 
 Or how believing in His word 
 Wrought peace within my heart. 
 
[C]
 But I know whom I've believ√®d; 
 He's able now to save 
 What I've committed unto Him 
 Until that final day.
 
[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves,
 Convincing men of sin;
 Revealing Jesus through the word,
 Creating faith in Him.
 
[V4]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me,
 Of weary ways or golden days
 Before His face I see.
 
[V5]
 I know not when my Lord may come;
 I know not how or where,
 If I shall pass the vale of death,
 Or meet Him in the air.
