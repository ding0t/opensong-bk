[V1]
 One more step along the world I go,
 One more step along the world I go,
 From the old things to the new,
 Keep me travelling along with You.
 
[C]
 And it's from the old I travel to the new,
 Keep me travelling along with You.
 
[V2]
 Round the corners of the world I turn,
 More and more about the world I learn.
 All the new things that I see,
 You'll be looking at along with me.
 
[V3]
 As I travel through the bad and good,
 Keep me travelling the way I should.
 Where I see no way to go,
 You'll be telling me the way, I know.
 
[V4]
 Give me courage when the world is rough,
 Keep me loving when the world is tough.
 Leap and sing in all I do,
 Keep me travelling along with You.
 
[V5]
 You are older than the world can be,
 You are younger than the life in me.
 Ever old and ever new,
 Keep me travelling along with You.
