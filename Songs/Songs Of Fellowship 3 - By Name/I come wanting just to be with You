[V1]
 I come, wanting just to be with You;
 Today let me hear Your voice.
 I come, wanting just to give to You,
 To say, You are everything.
 
[V2]
 Don't ever let my heart grow cold,
 Don't ever let me lose sight of Your truth.
 Draw near that I may drink from eternal water.
 
[V3]
 You are the Fountain of all life,
 You are the peace unto my soul.
 You are the Way, the Truth, the Light;
 Jesus, into Your arms I run.
 ||You are the holy Son of God,
 You gave up Your life to save my soul.
 You have redeemed me through the cross;
 Jesus, with thankfulness I come.
