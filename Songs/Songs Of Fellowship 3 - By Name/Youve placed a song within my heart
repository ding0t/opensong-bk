[V1]
 You've placed a song within my heart,
 And this song will bless You,
 Your praise is always on my lips.
 Whatever life may bring, 
 I know that You are God;
 So I can trust in You and sing.
 
[V2]
 Immanuel, God with us,
 Immanuel, You are near.
 Immanuel, my God is for me,
 My God is for me.
 So...
 
[C]
 I will bless the Lord at all times,
 I will bless the Lord at all times.
 In every situation I will give You praise,
 I will rejoice in You always.
 (Repeat)
