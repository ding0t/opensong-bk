[V1]
 I'm learning to love You,     
 To love and to trust You.
 I'm learning to give You all that I am.
 I'm learning to cling to the words You have spoken.
 I'm learning to let go my life in Your hands.
 
[V2]
 For You are faithful in all of Your ways,
 In wisdom unsearchable, and full of grace.
 Oh, You are beautiful beyond words.
 I'm learning to love You.
 
[V3]
 So teach me to love You, 
 To love and to trust You,
 And teach me to give You all that I am.
 And teach me to cling to the words You have spoken,
 Teach me to let go my life in Your hands.
 
[V4]
 We are like shadows that change with the day;
 And like the flowers our beauty will fade.
 But Yours is the kingdom and the power;
 Forever and ever Your glory will always remain.
