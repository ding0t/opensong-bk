[V1]
 You are all I want, 
 You're all I need to be set free.
 Your cross of death gives life to me,
 Your sacrifice brings liberty.
 No one else could take my place but You,
 The perfect One, the holy God,
 Revealed as man in Jesus Christ.
 Only You could take my sin, so...
 
[C]
 I love You, yeah, I love You, Jesus.
 I love You, yeah, I love You, Jesus.
 
[V2]
 I will give to You my everything, 
 Abandon all my selfish dreams 
 To live for You and do Your will every day.
 You have touched my heart 
 And made me whole,
 You've made me clean, so I will give 
 My offering of love to You,
 All my life lived just for You, 'cause...
