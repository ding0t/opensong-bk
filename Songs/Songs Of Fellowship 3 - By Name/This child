[V1]
 This child, secretly comes in the night,
 O this Child, hiding a heavenly light,
 O this Child, coming to us like a stranger,
 This heavenly Child.
 
[C]
 This Child, heaven come down now
 To be with us here,
 Heavenly love and mercy appear,
 Softly in awe and wonder come near -
 To this heavenly Child.
 
[V2]
 This Child, rising on us like the sun,
 O this Child, given to light everyone,
 O this Child, guiding our feet on the pathway
 To peace on earth.
 
[V3]
 This Child, raising the humble and poor,
 O this Child, making the proud ones to fall;
 O this Child, filling the hungry with good things,
 This heavenly Child.
