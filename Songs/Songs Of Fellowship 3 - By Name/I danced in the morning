[V1]
 'I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
 And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
 And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth:
 At Bethlehem I had My birth.
 
[C]
 'Dance, then, wherever you may be,
 I am the Lord of the dance,' said He,
 'And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
 And I'll lead you all in the dance,' said He.
 
[V2]
 'I danced for the scribe and the pharisee,
 But they would not dance and they wouldn't follow Me.
 I danced for the fishermen, for James and John - 
 They came with Me and the dance went on.
 
[V3]
 'I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame;
 The holy people said it was a shame.
 They whipped and they stripped and they hung Me on high,
 And they left Me there on a cross to die.
 
[V4]
 'I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black;
 It's hard to dance with the devil on your back.
 They buried My body and they thought I'd gone,
 But I am the dance, and I still go on.
 
[V5]
 'They cut Me down and I leapt up high;
 I am the life that'll never, never die.
 I'll live in you if you'll live in Me;
 I am the Lord of the dance', said He.
