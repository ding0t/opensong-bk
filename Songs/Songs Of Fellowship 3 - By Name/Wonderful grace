[V1]
 Wonderful grace, 
 That gives what I don't deserve, 
 Pays me what Christ has earned, 
 Then lets me go free. 
 Wonderful grace, 
 That gives me the time to change, 
 Washes away the stains 
 That once covered me. 
 
[C]
 And all that I have 
 I lay at the feet 
 Of the wonderful Saviour 
 Who loves me.
 
[V2]
 Wonderful love, 
 That held in the face of death,
 Breathed in its latest breath
 Forgiveness for me.
 Wonderful love, 
 Whose power can break every chain,
 Giving us life again,
 Setting us free.
