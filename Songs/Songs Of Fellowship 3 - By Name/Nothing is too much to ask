[V1]
 Nothing is too much to ask
 Now that I have said I'm Yours,
 Jesus, take the whole of me 
 Unreservedly.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, take me deeper now
 That I might go further too,
 I've received so much from You
 Undeservedly.
 
[V3]
 I was made to love You, Lord,
 I was saved to worship You.
 You will be the focus
 Of all eternity.
