[V1]
 Day after day, I'll search to find You;
 Day after day, I'll wait for You.
 The deeper I go, the more I love Your name.
 
[C]
 So keep my heart pure,
 And my ways true,
 As I follow You.
 Keep me humble,
 I'll stay mindful 
 Of Your mercies, Lord.
 
[V2]
 I'll cherish Your word,
 I'll seek Your presence,
 I'll chase after You with all I have.
 As one day I know 
 I'll see You face to face.
