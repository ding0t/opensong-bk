[V1]
 Lord, I come to You,
 Broken and lost,
 Jesus, be the highest part.
 Here I am again,
 Longing for more,
 Waiting for Your presence, here,
 Your presence here.
 
[V2]
 And how can I do anything but praise You?
 How can I not worship You,
 And how can I live my life 
 Without You, God?
 ||Lord, You amaze me with Your favour,
 Lord, You astound me with Your love,
 And how can I live my life 
 Without You, God?
