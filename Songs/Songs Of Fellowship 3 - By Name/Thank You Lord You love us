[V1]
 Thank You, Lord, You love us,
 Thank You, Lord, You care.
 Thank You, Lord, You made us,
 Thank You, Lord, You're there.
 ||Thank You for forgiveness,
 Your gift of life to me.
 Thank You for Your faithfulness,
 You're always, always, always, always
 Good to me.
 
[C]
 So we really want to say,
 'We love You,'
 We really want to shout,
 'You're the best!'
 We're gonna bring our praise to You,
 King of kings and my best friend.
 (Repeat)
 Oh yeah!
