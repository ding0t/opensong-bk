[V1]
 King of kings, Majesty,
 God of heaven living in me.
 Gentle Saviour, closest Friend,
 Strong Deliverer, Beginning and End:
 All within me falls at Your throne.
 
[C]
 Your majesty, I can but bow;
 I lay my all before You now.
 In royal robes I don't deserve,
 I live to serve Your majesty.
 
[V2]
 Earth and heaven worship You,
 Love eternal, faithful and true,
 Who bought the nations, ransomed souls,
 Brought this sinner near to Your throne:
 All within me cries out in praise.
