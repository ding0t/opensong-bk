[C]
 Jesus, high King of heaven,
 We bring our high praise to You.
 Jesus, high King of heaven,
 To whom all high praise is due.
 
[V1]
 Who can be compared to You, O Holy One?
 None in heaven or earth is Your equal.
 You will not share Your glory with another;
 Honour to Your name.
 
[V2]
 O Lord God Almighty, who is like You?
 Yesterday, today and forever,
 Power, mercy, faithfulness surround You;
 Eternal is Your name.
 
[V3]
 You are the image, the radiance of God's glory.
 Through You the universe was made.
 You are the Alpha, Omega, the First and Last,
 You are the Beginning and the End
