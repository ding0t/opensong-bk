[C]
 This means I love You,
 Singing this song;
 Lord, I don't have the words,
 But I do have the will.
 And this means I love You,
 That I take up the cross,
 I will sing as I walk out this love.
 
[V1]
 Jesus, this life is for You,
 Everything, Lord, that I do;
 Deeds that are pleasing
 And ways that are pure,
 Lord, may my life bear this fruit.
 
[V2]
 For these are the plans of my heart,
 Yet often I'm missing the mark;
 See my desire to live in Your truth,
 This surely means I love You.
