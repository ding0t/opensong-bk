[V1]
 Here am I, a sinner free, 
 Pardoned by Your majesty,
 Your love has led me into liberty.
 Holy King, upon the throne, 
 You've made this heart Your very own.
 I feel like the leper who's been healed.
 
[C]
 Lost and dirty, yet You found me.
 Stained by sin, but You have cleansed me.
 Can it be I'm precious in Your sight?
 What is man, and who am I?
 A child of God, my Father's pride,
 What a joy to be the Lord's delight.
 
[V2]
 I have known a love so sweet, 
 A saving love that brings relief,
 A healing love that makes the blind eye see.
 King of Love and Prince of Peace,
 Your Shepherd's love is tending me â€“
 A love that satisfies my deepest needs.
