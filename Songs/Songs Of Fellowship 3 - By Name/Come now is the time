[V1]
 Come, now is the time to worship,
 Come, now is the time to give your heart.
 Come, just as you are to worship,
 Come, just as you are before your God.
 Come.
 
[V2]
 One day every tongue will confess You are God.
 One day every knee will bow.
 Still, the greatest treasure remains for those
 Who gladly choose You now.
