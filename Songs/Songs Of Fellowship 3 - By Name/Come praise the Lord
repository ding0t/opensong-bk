[V1]
 Come, praise the Lord,
 He is life in all its fullness;
 Will you lift your voice?
 Come, praise the Lord,
 He is light that shatters darkness;
 We have come to rejoice.
 All around the world He is calling
 People who would take up His call
 And follow Him.
 
[C]
 Every breath be praise,
 Every heart be raised
 To the King of all creation.
 Every breath be praise,
 Every heart be raised
 To the Lord of all.
 
[V2]
 Come, praise the Lord,
 He is love that welcomes sinners;
 Will you give your life?
 Come praise the Lord,
 He is great above all others;
 All His ways are right.
 All around the world He is calling
 People who would take up His call
 And follow Him.
