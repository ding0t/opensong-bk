[V1]
 When I needed a neighbour, 
 Were you there, were you there?
 When I needed a neighbour, were you there?
 
[C]
 And the creed and the colour 
 And the name won't matter,
 Were you there?
 
[V2]
 I was hungry and thirsty, 
 Were you there, were you there?
 I was hungry and thirsty, were you there?
 
[V3]
 I was cold, I was naked, 
 Were you there, were you there?
 I was cold, I was naked, were you there?
 
[V4]
 When I needed a shelter, 
 Were you there, were you there?
 When I needed a shelter, were you there?
 
[V5]
 When I needed a healer, 
 Were you there, were you there?
 When I needed a healer, were you there?
 
[V6]
 Wherever you travel, 
 I'll be there, I'll be there.
 Wherever you travel, I'll be there.
 
[C2]
 And the creed and the colour 
 And the name won't matter,
 I'll be there.
