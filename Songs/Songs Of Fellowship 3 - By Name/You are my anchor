[V1]
 You are my anchor,
 My light and my salvation.
 You are my refuge,
 My heart will not fear.
 ||Though my foes surround me on every hand,
 They will stumble and fall 
 While in grace I stand.
 In my day of trouble 
 You hide me and set me above
 To sing this song of love.
 
[C]
 One thing I will ask of You, this will I pray:
 To dwell in Your house, O Lord, every day,
 To gaze upon Your lovely face,
 And rest in the Father's embrace.
 
[V2]
 Teach me Your way, Lord,
 Make straight the path before me.
 Do not forsake me, my hope is in You.
 ||As I walk through life, I am confident
 I will see Your goodness with every step,
 And my heart directs me to seek You 
 In all that I do,
 So I will wait for You.
