[V1]
 I have come to love You,
 For You have won my heart
 When You revealed Your love to me.
 My life will be a witness
 Of such love and such forgiveness,
 For You have given me Your peace,
 And You're everything I need.
 
[C]
 I love to sing Your name,
 To speak about Your fame,
 You're worthy of my praise.
 I long to worship You
 In spirit and in truth,
 It's all I want to do.
 
[V2]
 You have come to love me
 And heal my broken heart,
 Now I am reaching out to You.
 Your strength is in my weakness,
 I'm clinging to Your promise,
 So let Your work in me shine through
 In everything I do.
 
[V3]
 As I come before You now,
 Let Your Spirit touch me;
 I will make this gospel known.
 Fill me with Your love and power
 And Your compassion,
 Through me let Your kingdom come.
