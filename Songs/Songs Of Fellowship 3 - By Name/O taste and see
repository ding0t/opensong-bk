[V1]
 O taste and see that the Lord is good.
 O taste and see that the Lord is good.
 
[V2]
 He is a mighty God,
 His ways are higher than ours;
 There's nothing impossible for Him.
 The future is in His hands.
 We're a part of His perfect plan,
 And we can do all things
 Through the power of His love.
