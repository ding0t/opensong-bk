[V1]
 May the words of my mouth,
 And the thoughts of my heart
 Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus:
 And the deeds of the day, 
 And the truth in my ways,
 Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus.
 
[C]
 For this is what I'm glad to do,
 It's time to live a life of love 
 That pleases You.
 And I will give my all to You,
 Surrender everything I have and follow You,
 I'll follow You.
 
[V2]
 Lord, will You be my vision,
 Lord, will You be my guide:
 Be my hope, be my light, and the way?
 And I'll look not for riches,
 Nor praises on earth,
 Only You'll be the first of my heart.
 
[V3]
 I will follow, I will follow You.
 I will follow, I will follow You.
 I will follow, I will follow You.
 I will follow, I will follow You.
