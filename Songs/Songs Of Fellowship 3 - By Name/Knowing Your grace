[V1]
 Knowing Your grace 
 Has set me free, Lord. 
 I'm seeking Your face; 
 I feel Your pleasure, 
 Your joy in the ones 
 You have chosen by name.
 You've lifted my burdens 
 And cast off my shame.
 
[V2]
 Feeling Your touch 
 Gives me such peace, Lord.
 I love You so much, 
 I know You'll lead me.
 Wherever I go I'll be under Your wing,
 For I am a child of the King.
 
[V3]
 You will finish the work You've begun in me,
 I'm adopted, a son in Your family!
 You've drawn me with kindness and love
 Into this holy place.
 
[V4]
 What can I say?
 Your lavish mercy
 Turned night into day â€“
 My guilt has gone now.
 Forever I'll stand in Your presence and sing,
 For I am a child of the King.
