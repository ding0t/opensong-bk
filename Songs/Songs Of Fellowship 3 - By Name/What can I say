[V1]
 What can I say but 'I love You'?
 What can I say but 'I praise You'?
 As the train of Your robe fills this temple,
 As the sound of Your voice fills this place.
 ||What can I do but to bow down?
 What can I do but to worship?
 Only You are the One who is worthy,
 Only You are the One who is Lord.
 
[V2]
 Great is the Lord, so great is the Lord,
 Righteous and true God, holy and pure.
 I fall on my knees confessing my need
 For more of Your presence, Lord.
