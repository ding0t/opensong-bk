[V1]
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek,
 To see Your face, to gaze upon Your beauty,
 To search behind the eyes of love.
 
[V2]
 To spend my days within the veil,
 Where the purity and light pour over me,
 And I am changed.
 
[C1]
 I gaze on the One who so desired
 Friendship with one as low as me.
 You left behind Your throne
 So I'll sing of Your love (sing of Your love).
 
[V3]
 All I held close I now let go.
 All else is loss compared to knowing You,
 And I am changed.
 
[C2]
 The King who became the sacrifice,
 Broken and cursed upon the tree,
 The Saviour of my soul,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
