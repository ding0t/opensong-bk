[V1]
 Father, hear the prayer we offer:
 Not for ease that prayer shall be,
 But for strength, that we may ever
 Live our lives courageously.
 
[V2]
 Not for ever in green pastures
 Do we ask our way to be:
 But by steep and rugged pathways
 Would we strive to climb to Thee.
 
[V3]
 Not for ever by still waters
 Would we idly quiet stay;
 But would smite the living fountains
 From the rocks along our way.
 
[V4]
 Be our strength in hours of weakness,
 In our wanderings be our Guide;
 Through endeavour, failure, danger,
 Father, be Thou at our side.
 
[V5]
 Let our path be bright or dreary,
 Storm or sunshine be our share;
 May our souls, in hope unweary,
 Make Thy work our ceaseless prayer.
