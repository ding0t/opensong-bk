[V1]
 I come to You, to sit at Your feet,
 I hear You call, I'm longing to meet You.
 I lift my face to You, and catch Your eye,
 Oh how You satisfy.
 
[C]
 Jesus, Your love surrounds me.
 Jesus, Your love completes me.
 
[V2]
 Now looking closer, I see the scars,
 Stories of love, You paid the greatest price,
 So that I may have life.
 Thank You, my Friend,
 You're showing me once again.
 
[V3]
 There's nothing like it,
 There's nothing like it,
 There's nothing like the love of God.
 (Repeat)
 
[V4]
 No longer searching, I've found the One,
 Just touched the surface, only begun;
 This love goes deeper 
 Than any I've known.
