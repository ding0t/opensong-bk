[V1]
 This is love, not that we loved Him,
 But that He first loved us.
 Left behind glories of heaven;
 Took on the shame of the cross.
 But in the place where love was poured
 Death could not hold our risen Lord.
 
[C]
 On Christ our solid ground,
 Our hope for life is found;
 The joy of our salvation.
 On Christ our solid ground,
 Our hope for life is found.
 There is no condemnation.
 There is no condemnation.
 
[V2]
 This is peace, not as the world gives,
 But the true peace of Christ.
 You have claimed our hearts for heaven;
 Living by faith, not by sight.
 Strengthen our faith in You alone
 Until we stand before Your throne.
