[V1]
 I have His word,
 His great and precious promises.
 He took my sin, His righteousness is mine.
 ||I am in Christ, 
 Secure for all eternity:
 No power can sever me, nor cast me off
 From His abundant, free
 And sovereign love.
 
[V2]
 I have His word,
 The Master Builder will succeed.
 The gates of hell, they never will prevail.
 ||Throughout the earth
 The joy of Jesus is His church;
 She is the mystery that stirred His heart,
 Drawing Him out of heaven
 To shed His blood.
 
[V3]
 I have His word,
 A day is fixed when all the world
 In sudden awe the Son of God shall see.
 ||And in that day
 Our eyes shall see His majesty;
 What then of sufferings? What then of tears?
 We shall see perfectly
 When He appears!
 
[V4]
 I have His word
 That every race shall reign with Him,
 We'll reach our home, the new Jerusalem.
 ||The Triune God
 Shall dwell with man eternally,
 More joys than eye has seen or ear has heard
 Wait for us certainly,
 I have His word.
