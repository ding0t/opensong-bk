[V1]
 You've touched my heart
 With words of Your mercy
 And thoughts of Your beauty.
 Your presence, God,
 Has captured me now
 With the hope of Your glory.
 You've opened my eyes to see
 You're all that this heart can need.
 
[C]
 For what is worthy of the King of kings,
 But a heart that is satisfied in loving You?
 Yours is the song, 
 Yours is the praise I'll bring,
 With a passion for the wonder
 Of seeing Your glory here.
 
[V2]
 This song I'll bring
 Is my song of love from
 A heart that's been broken.
 It's what You've done,
 For I've been set free by
 The life that You've given.
 Faithful and holy One,
 Forever I live to sing.
