[V1]
 As we bring our songs of love today,
 Do you hear a sound more glorious?
 Like the mighty roar of ocean waves,
 Many witnesses surround us.
 ||It's a harmony of costly praise
 From the lips of those who suffer,
 Of sighs and tears and martyrs' prayers
 Until this age is over.
 
[C1]
 How long, Lord, till You come?
 How long till the earth
 Is filled with Your song?
 How long until Your justice
 Shines like the sun?
 ||How long, Lord, till You come?
 How long till the earth
 Is filled with Your song?
 How long? How long?
 
[V2]
 Lord, help us to live worthy of
 Our sisters and our brothers
 Who love You more than their own lives,
 Who worship as they suffer:
 ||To embrace the scandal of the cross.
 Not ashamed to tell Your story,
 To count all earthly gain as loss,
 To know You and Your glory.
 
[C2]
 How long, Lord, till You come?
 How long till the earth
 Is filled with Your song?
 How long until Your justice
 Shines like the sun?
 ||How long, Lord till You come?
 How long till the whole world hears
 And the work is done,
 Until at last we see You return?
 ||How long, Lord, till You come?
 How long till the earth 
 Is filled with Your song?
 How long? How long?
