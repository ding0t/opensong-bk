[V1]
 When my heart runs dry
 And there's no song to sing, 
 No holy melody,
 No words of love within,
 I recall the height from which
 This fragile heart has slipped.
 
[C]
 And I'll remember You,
 I will turn back and do
 The things I used to do
 For the love of You.
 Lord, I'll remember You,
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I need to do
 For the love You.
 
[V2]
 You are my soul's desire,
 You are the hope within,
 You bring my heart to life,
 You make my spirit sing.
 I recall the height from which 
 This fragile heart has slipped.
