[V1]
 My hope is in the Lord 
 Who has renewed my strength,
 When everything seems senseless,
 My hope is still in Him
 Who has made heaven and earth 
 And things seen and unseen;
 Whatever shade of passing day, 
 My hope is still in Him.
 
[C]
 My hope is in You, Lord.
 My hope is in You, Lord.
 My hope is in You, Lord.
 My hope is in You, Lord.
 
[V2]
 For I know that my eyes shall see You,
 In the latter days to come.
 When You stand on the earth,
 With my lips, I will confess 
 That the hope of my heart is come,
 That the hope of my heart is come.
