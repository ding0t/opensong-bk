[V1]
 I just want to love,
 I just want to sing
 To the One above
 Who has touched this thirsty soul.
 (Repeat)
 And now I'll never be the same.
 
[C]
 I'll always love You,
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus.
 I long to worship You in spirit and in truth.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Every day I'll come,
 Spend my life with You,
 Learning of Your heart,
 And what You're calling me to do.
 (Repeat)
 My every breath belongs to You.
 
[V3]
 And with this song
 We'll lift the name of Jesus higher.
 And with a shout
 We'll raise up one voice.
