[V1]
 Jesus Christ, 
 You came into this world to rescue me.
 On the cross,
 My sin was laid on You, what agony.
 There Your precious life-blood flowed so free.
 Every drop that fell still cleanses me.
 
[C1]
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 Pouring out for me like a flood.
 
[V2]
 I am safe
 Upon the ocean of Your mercy.
 I am loved
 With all the passion of eternity.
 It is deeper than the deepest sea;
 Like a tidal wave it carries me.
 
[C2]
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 All Your love 
 Sweeping over me like a flood.
 
[V3]
 So I stand
 Upon Your promise of eternal grace.
 I believe
 That I will one day see You face to face.
 I will worship You forevermore
 In ways I never have before.
 
[C3]
 All my love
 All my love
 All my love
 All my love
 Flowing out to You like a flood.
