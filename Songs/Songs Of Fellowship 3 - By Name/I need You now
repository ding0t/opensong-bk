[V1]
 I need You now, 
 My King, my Love;
 I am more aware this clay 
 Than all Your power within.
 I wait for You, 
 My Hope, my Love,
 Because I've dreamed I'd see
 Your kingdom come and I still believe.
 
[C]
 So come and breathe on me now, 
 I am poured out for You.
 Come and release Your power.
 I'm crying out to You,
 I'm crying out to You.
 
[V2]
 What works have I?
 What fruit to show?
 I can hardly stand before Your grace, 
 Yet I, I know
 Your love, Your grace
 Has lifted me,
 But I need You now so I can build
 With gold, pure gold.
 
[V3]
 Your promise alone 
 Should be enough for me.
 Still I'm crying out,
 'I need Your touch.'
