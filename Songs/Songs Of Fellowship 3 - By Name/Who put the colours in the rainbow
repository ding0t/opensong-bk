[V1]
 Who put the colours in the rainbow?
 Who put the salt into the sea?
 Who put the cold into the snowflake?
 Who made you and me?
 Who put the hump upon the camel?
 Who put the neck on the giraffe?
 Who put the tail upon the monkey?
 Who made hyenas laugh?
 ||Who made whales and snails and quails?
 Who made hogs and dogs and frogs?
 Who made bats and rats and cats?
 Who made everything?
 
[V2]
 Who put the gold into the sunshine?
 Who put the sparkle in the stars?
 Who put the silver in the moonlight?
 Who made Earth and Mars?
 Who put the scent into the roses?
 Who taught the honey bee to dance?
 Who put the tree inside the acorn?
 It surely can't be chance!
 ||Who made seas and leaves and trees?
 Who made snow and winds that blow?
 Who made streams and rivers flow?
 God made all of these!
