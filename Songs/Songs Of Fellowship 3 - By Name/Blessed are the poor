[V1]
 Blessèd are the poor in spirit,
 For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
 Blessèd are the mourning hearts,
 Comfort to them will be given.
 ||Blessèd are the humble and meek,
 They will inherit the earth.
 Blessèd are those who hunger and thirst 
 For righteousness,
 For they will be filled.
 
[C1]
 Rejoice and be glad,
 For great your reward in heaven.
 Rejoice and be glad,
 For great your reward in heaven.
 
[V2]
 Blessèd are the merciful, 
 For mercy to them will be shown.
 Blessèd are the pure in heart,
 For they will see their God.
 ||Blessèd are the makers of peace,
 They will be called sons of God.
 Blessèd are those who suffer for Christ
 And righteousness,
 Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
 
[C2]
 Give glory to God,
 For He's our reward in heaven.
 Give glory to God,
 For He's our reward in heaven.
 
[C3]
 Rejoice and be glad,
 Give glory to God in heaven.
 Rejoice and be glad,
 Give glory to God in heaven.
