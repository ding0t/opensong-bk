[V1]
 You chose the cross with every breath,
 The perfect life, the perfect death:
 You chose the cross.
 ||A crown of thorns You wore for us,
 And crowned us with eternal life:
 You chose the cross.
 And though Your soul was overwhelmed with pain,
 Obedient to death You overcame.
 
[C]
 I'm lost in wonder,
 I'm lost in love,
 I'm lost in praise forevermore.
 Because of Jesus' unfailing love
 I am forgiven, I am restored.
 
[V2]
 You loosed the cords of sinfulness
 And broke the chains of my disgrace:
 You chose the cross.
 ||Up from the grave victorious,
 You rose again so glorious:
 You chose the cross.
 The sorrow that surrounded You was mine,
 'Yet not My will but Yours be done!' You cried.
