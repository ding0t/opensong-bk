[V1]
 Lord, I come, longing to know You,
 Lord, I come, drawn by Your love;
 Lord, I come, longing to see Your face,
 For You called me to come
 Into the holiest place.
 
[C]
 What did I do to deserve Your favour?
 What did I do to deserve Your grace?
 Called by my name into Your presence,
 Undeserved, holy God.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I come, because of Jesus,
 Lord, I come, because He came;
 Lord, I bow, as You reveal Your face,
 You have called me to come
 Into the holiest place.
