[V1]
 Breathe on me, O wind of change,
 Anoint me with fresh oil from Your throne.
 Lord, restore me with new life,
 ||So I'm ready to serve 
 And I'm ready to go,
 Ready to do Your will.
 So I'm ready to serve 
 And I'm ready to go,
 Ready to do Your will.
 
[V2]
 Lord, help me to run this race
 And to live by Your grace,
 All I want to do is Your will.
 (Repeat)
 
[V3]
 Ready to serve, ready to go,
 Ready to do, ready to be,
 Ready to do Your will.
 (Repeat)
