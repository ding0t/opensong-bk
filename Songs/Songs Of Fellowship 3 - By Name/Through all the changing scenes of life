[C]
 Through all the changing scenes of life,
 In trouble and in joy,
 The praises of my God shall still
 My heart and tongue employ.
 
[V1]
 Of His deliverance I will boast,
 Till all that are distressed
 From my example comfort take,
 And charm their griefs to rest.
 
[V2]
 O magnify the Lord with me,
 With me exalt His name;
 When in distress to Him I called,
 He to my rescue came.
 
[V3]
 The hosts of God encamp around
 The dwellings of the just;
 Deliverance He affords to all
 Who on His succour trust.
 
[V4]
 O make but trial of His love;
 Experience will decide
 How blest are they, and only they,
 Who in His truth confide.
 
[V5]
 Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
 Have nothing else to fear;
 Make you His service your delight;
 Your wants shall be His care.
