[C]
 There's no one like our God,
 No one at all.
 He gave His Son for us,
 Jesus the Lord.
 And who can love us like He does?
 No one at all.
 Oh, how we love You, Lord.
 
[V1]
 You are high above all nations,
 Your glory shines above the heavens;
 Humbled Yourself to love and save us:
 Be praised through endless generations.
 
[V2]
 You lift the needy from the ashes,
 And seat them high up with the princes.
 You give the barren woman healing;
 She'll dance for joy like the mother of children.
