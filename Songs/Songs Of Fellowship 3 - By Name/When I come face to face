[V1]
 When I come face to face
 With the One the angels praise,
 I'm in awe, I'm amazed
 With a God full of grace.
 ||It's the love You have shown
 That allows me at Your throne
 To adore, and how I do:
 Father, I'm in love with You.
 
[V2]
 Here I am with lifted hands,
 I give You praise 
 And I exalt Your holy name
 With all I have,
 With all the strength that I can raise.
 ||And here I am once again,
 I lift my voice
 With all the angels 'round Your throne.
 I adore and I worship You alone.
 
[V3]
 I am in love, 
 I am in love with all my heart,
 With all my soul, and all my mind
 With all the strength I've ever known.
 ||I am in love, 
 I am in love with the King
 And with His Son, the One who loved
 With His life and with His blood.
