[V1]
 You are forever in my life,
 You see me through the seasons;
 Cover me with Your hand,
 And lead me in Your righteousness.
 And I look to You,
 And I wait on You.
 
[C]
 I'll sing to You, Lord, a hymn of love
 For Your faithfulness to me.
 I'm carried in everlasting arms;
 You'll never let me go,
 Through it all.
 
[V2]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
