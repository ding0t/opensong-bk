[V1]
 Belovèd and blessèd,
 The Father's pure delight.
 Redeemer, Sustainer,
 You're my passion and my prize.
 
[V2]
 My Brother, my Comforter,
 My Shepherd and my Friend.
 My Ransom, my Righteousness,
 You're the Stream that never ends. 
 
[C1]
 You're unchanging, You're magnificent,
 You are all I could desire.
 You're my Breath of life,
 Sun of righteousness,
 You're the Love that satisfies. 
 
[V3]
 There's kindness, compassion
 For those who will draw near;
 Acceptance, forgiveness,
 And a love that conquers fear.
 
[C2]
 You're the Word of life,
 You're the Bread of heaven,
 You're the Lion and the Lamb.
 All within me cries, 
 'Lord be glorified
 By everything I am.'
 
[V4]
 Belovèd, my Belovèd.
