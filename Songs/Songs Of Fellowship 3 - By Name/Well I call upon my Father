[V1]
 Well, I call upon my Father
 In the name of Christ Your Son,
 Let the streams of Your forgiveness
 Come upon me as a flood.
 
[C]
 I give my love to my Creator,
 Reveal my heart unto my God.
 I bring my life before the Healer,
 For I know in You my shame 
 Will be thrown down.
 
[V2]
 For with sin there's separation,
 Yet by grace through faith I'm saved;
 Can You hear my spirit crying,
 'Come and wash my sin away'?
 
[V3]
 You're washing me down,
 You're washing me down. 
 You're washing me down,
 You're washing me down. 
 
[V4]
 Well I call upon my Father
 In the name of Christ Your Son,
 Now I've tasted Your forgiveness, 
 My redemption through Your blood.
