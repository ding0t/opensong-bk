[V1]
 You call us first to love Your name,
 To worship You.
 To please Your heart our one desire,
 O Lord.
 
[C]
 If there's one thing we are called to do,
 It's to love You, to adore You.
 We will bring our all and worship You,
 Bow before You, as we love You.
 
[V2]
 Your honour, Lord, Your name's renown
 We long to see.
 So let the glory of Your name
 Be praised.
 
[V3]
 I will celebrate this love,
 Jesus, You are everything to me.
 For what more, Lord, can I do?
 I will give this heart, this life to You.
