[C]
 We've come to praise You,
 'Cause You're worthy.
 Nobody like You in Your glory.
 We love to praise You, 
 'Cause You're holy, awesome, 
 Wonderful, mighty God.
 
[V1]
 And everything that You do 
 Comes from a heart of love 
 And a hand of mercy;
 For You are faithful and true,
 Working all things for good 
 For those who love You.
 
[V2]
 For if God in love did not spare His Son,
 But He gave Him up for His chosen ones,
 How much more will He freely give to us
 Who call upon His name?
 ||Who call upon His name?
 Who call upon His name?
 Who call upon His name?
