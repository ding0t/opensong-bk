[C]
 All of You is more than enough for
 All of me, for every thirst and every need,
 You satisfy me with Your love,
 And all I have in You
 Is more than enough.
 
[V1]
 You're my supply,
 My breath of life;
 Still more awesome than I know.
 You're my reward,
 Worth living for;
 Still more awesome than I know.
 
[V2]
 You're my sacrifice 
 Of greatest price;
 Still more awesome than I know.
 You're my coming King,
 You are everything;
 Still more awesome than I know.
 
[V3]
 More than all I want,
 More than all I need,
 You are more than enough for me.
 More than all I know,
 More than all I can,
 You are more than enough.
