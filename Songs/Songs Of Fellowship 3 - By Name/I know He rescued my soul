[V1]
 I know He rescued my soul,
 His blood has covered my sin,
 I believe, I believe.
 My shame He's taken away,
 My pain is healed in His name,
 I believe, I believe.
 I'll raise a banner;
 My Lord has conquered the grave.
 
[C]
 My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives;
 My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives.
 
[V2]
 You lift my burden, I'll rise with You:
 I'm dancing on this mountain-top
 To see Your kingdom come.
