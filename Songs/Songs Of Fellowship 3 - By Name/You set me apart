[V1]
 You set me apart, 
 Gave me a new heart, 
 Filled with compassion 
 To share Your great love.
 Show me Your ways,
 I want to know You.
 Guide me in truth,
 My hope is in You.
 
[C]
 That I may dwell in Your house forever,
 Lifting up Your name;
 Dwell in Your house forevermore.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 I'll hold on to You,
 My strength and my refuge.
 Whom shall I fear?
 I know You are near.
 All of my days 
 I live for You, Lord.
 Establish my path,
 There's one thing I ask.
 
[V3]
 Holy Spirit, have Your way.
 Sweet anointing, teach our hearts,
 Our lives, we pray.
