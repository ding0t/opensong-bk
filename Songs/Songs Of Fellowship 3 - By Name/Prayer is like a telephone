[V1]
 Prayer is like a telephone
 For us to talk to Jesus.
 Prayer is like a telephone
 For us to talk to God.
 Prayer is like a telephone
 For us to talk to Jesus.
 Pick it up and use it every day.
 
[V2]
 We can shout out loud,
 We can whisper softly,
 We can make no noise at all.
 But He'll always hear our call.
