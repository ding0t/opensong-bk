[V1]
 Let the poor man say, I am rich in Him;
 Let the lost man say I am found in Him:
 Let the river flow.
 Let the blind man say, I can see again;
 Let that dead man say, I am born again:
 Let the river flow.
 
[V2]
 Let the river flow,
 Let the river flow,
 Let the river flow.
 Holy Spirit, come; 
 Move in power.
 Let the river flow.
 (Let the river flow)
