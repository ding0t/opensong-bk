[C]
 King of the ages, Almighty God,
 Perfect love, ever just and true.
 Who will not fear You and bring You praise?
 All the nations will come to You.
 
[V1]
 Your ways of love have won my heart,
 And brought me joy unending.
 Your saving power at work in me,
 Bringing peace and the hope of glory.
 
[V2]
 Your arms of love are reaching out
 To every soul that seeks You;
 Your light will shine in all the earth,
 Bringing grace and a great salvation.
 
[V3]
 The day will come when You appear,
 And every eye shall see You.
 Then we shall rise with hearts ablaze,
 With a song we will sing forever.
