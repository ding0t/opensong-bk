[V1]
 I live my life to worship You,
 I spend my days serving You,
 And now I come, I come.
 I want to spend some time with You,
 To steal away and be with You,
 So now I come, I come.
 
[C]
 Just to be with You,
 Just to know more of Your love;
 Just to be with You,
 And to love You.
 
[V2]
 And here You know me,
 And here You know me,
 And here You know me,
 And here I love You.
