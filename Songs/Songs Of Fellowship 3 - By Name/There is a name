[V1]
 There is a name that's high over all.
 There is a King seated on the throne.
 And He's interceding for me,
 So that I will be made holy,
 And I know that in His love
 I will stay.
 
[C1]
 What a Saviour is my Jesus,
 He came down 
 So that I may go free.
 
[V2]
 There is a Man who walked on the earth,
 The Word of God made known to us.
 He's the image of the Father,
 The Firstborn over creation,
 Yet He suffered at the hands of those He saves.
 
[C2]
 What a Saviour is my Jesus,
 He came down 
 So that I may go free.
 How I love You, oh my Jesus,
 You came down 
 So that I may go free.
