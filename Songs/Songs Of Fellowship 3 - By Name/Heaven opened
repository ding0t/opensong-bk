[V1]
 Heaven opened and You came to save me.
 You were broken and became sin for me.
 No death, no hate, no shame, 
 No slave again to fear;
 New life, new hope, new love, 
 Your kingdom's coming near.
 
[C]
 And I give You praise 
 And I lift my hands to You,
 All of my days 
 I will bring my love to You.
 I will give my life as an offering,
 As a sacrifice to the coming King of grace,
 Jesus.
 
[V2]
 You have risen from the grave forever.
 Through eternity I'll praise my Saviour.
 No death, no hate, no shame, 
 No slave again to fear;
 New life, new hope, new love, 
 Your kingdom's coming near.
 
[V3]
 I love and adore You,
 And live for Your praise.
 In truth and in spirit 
 I long for You, my King.
