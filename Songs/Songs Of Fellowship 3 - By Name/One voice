[V1]
 One voice, one mind, one will to see 
 The heart of God revealed in power. 
 Let every nation, tribe and tongue 
 Come seek the Lord and His great love. 
 
[C]
 Send a revival, send a revival, 
 Send a revival, we pray. 
 Send a revival, send a revival, 
 Send a revival, we pray.
 
[V2]
 We will not cease, we will not rest
 Until the Prince of Peace is seen.
 As God with us, Emmanuel,
 The hope of all humanity.
 
[V3]
 A vision burns within my soul
 That all the world will come to know
 The healing found at Calvary,
 That place where truth and mercy meet.
 
[V4]
 I hear a sound across the earth;
 It tells me that the time is near.
 An anthem lifting up His name:
 Make straight a path - prepare the way.
