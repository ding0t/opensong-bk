[V1]
 Lord Jesus, robed in splendour,
 Clothed in glory high over all.
 Lord Jesus, King Messiah, 
 Mighty Saviour, high over all.
 
[V2]
 Lord Jesus, all resplendent, 
 Adorned in beauty, who can compare?
 Lord Jesus, You are mighty,
 Your kingdom rules high over all.
 
[C]
 Yours is the name by which we are saved, 
 The Name high over all.
 Yours is the name which we will proclaim,
 For You are Lord of all.
 Jesus, Lord, high over,
 Jesus, Lord, high over all!
 
[V3]
 The heavens declare the glory of God; 
 The skies proclaim the work of His hands.
 The earth will be filled
 With the knowledge of His glory
 As the waters cover the sea.
