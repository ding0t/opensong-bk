[V1]
 Open up the skies of mercy,
 Rain down the cleansing flood;
 Healing waters rise around us;
 Hear our cries, Lord, let 'em rise.
 
[C]
 It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance;
 Your favour, Lord, is our desire.
 It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence,
 And Your love, Your love is better than life.
 
[V2]
 We can feel Your mercy falling;
 You are turning our hearts back again.
 Hear our praises rise to heaven;
 Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.
