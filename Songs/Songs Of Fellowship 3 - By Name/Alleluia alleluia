[V1]
 Alleluia, alleluia, Jesus is the Lord,
 He's the Lord of all my heart.
 Alleluia, alleluia, Jesus is the Lord,
 He's the Lord of all my heart.
 
[C1]
 He's the way, He's the truth, He's the life.
 He's the way, He's the truth, He's the life.
 He's the way, He's the truth, He's the life.

[C2]
 You're the way, You're the truth, You're the light.
