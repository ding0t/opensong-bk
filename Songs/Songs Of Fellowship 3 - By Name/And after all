[V1]
 And after all,
 Everything I once held dear 
 Just proved to be so vain.
 To lose it all, 
 And find a Friend who's always near 
 Could only be my gain.
 ||And when I think of what You've done for me,
 To bring me to the Father's side:
 
[C]
 Unashamed and unafraid,
 I will choose to wear Your name,
 In a world so full of hate,
 I will always live Your way.
 
[V2]
 Could it be
 That You should put on human flesh,
 Your glory laid aside?
 Bruised for me,
 Majesty upon the cross,
 Forsaken and despised.
 ||When I think of what it cost for You,
 To bring me to the Father's side: 
 
[C2]
 Unashamed and unafraid,
 I will choose to wear Your name,
 In a world so full of hate,
 I will always live Your way. 
 Unashamed and unafraid,
 I will love You all my days,
 I don't care what people say,
 I'm unashamed and unafraid.
 
[V3]
 I know some will say it's foolishness:
 You can't make a blind man see.
 But I know that there is power in the cross
 To save those who believe.
