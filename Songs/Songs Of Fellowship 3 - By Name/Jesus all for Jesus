[V1]
 Jesus, all for Jesus;
 All I am and have and ever hope to be.
 Jesus, all for Jesus;
 All I am and have and ever hope to be.
 
[V2]
 All of my ambitions, hopes and plans,
 I surrender these into Your hands.
 All of my ambitions, hopes and plans,
 I surrender these into Your hands.
 
[C]
 For it's only in Your will that I am free.
 For it's only in Your will that I am free.
 Jesus, all for Jesus;
 All I am and have and ever hope to be.
