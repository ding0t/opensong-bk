[V1]
 Give thanks to the Lord, 
 Our God and King: 
 His love endures forever. 
 For He is good, He is above all things. 
 His love endures forever. 
 Sing praise, sing praise. 
 
[V2]
 With a mighty hand 
 And an outstretched arm
 His love endures forever.
 For the life that's been reborn.
 His love endures forever.
 Sing praise, sing praise.
 Sing praise, sing praise.
 
[C]
 Forever God is faithful, 
 Forever God is strong. 
 Forever God is with us, 
 Forever.
 (Repeat)
 Forever.
 
[V3]
 From the rising to the setting sun,
 His love endures forever.
 By the grace of God, we will carry on.
 His love endures forever.
 Sing praise, sing praise.
 Sing praise, sing praise.
