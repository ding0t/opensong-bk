[V1]
 There is no other name
 By which men can be saved,
 There is no other name under heaven.
 There is rest for my soul
 And the wounded made whole,
 And the captives set free and forgiven.
 
[V2]
 Such love as I had never known,
 I've found in the grace that flowed to me
 In my unrighteousness;
 This is why my heart and soul and tongue confess.
