[V1]
 Lord, hear the music of my heart; 
 Hear all the pourings of my soul. 
 Songs telling of a life of love: 
 Jesus, this is all for You. 
 ||You've become the ruler of my heart; 
 You've become the lover of my soul. 
 You've become the Saviour of this life: 
 You are everything to me. 
 
[C1]
 (Oh now,) Jesus, Jesus, 
 I will pour my praise on You. 
 Worship, worship, 
 Demonstrates my love for You. 
 ||May I come to 
 Be a blessing to Your heart. 
 Jesus, Jesus, 
 Who can tell how wonderful You are, 
 How wonderful You are!
 
[C2]
 (Oh now,) Jesus, Jesus, 
 I will pour my praise on You. 
 Worship, worship, 
 Demonstrates my love for You. 
 ||May I come to 
 Be a blessing to Your heart. 
 Jesus, Jesus, 
 Who can tell how wonderful You are, 
 How wonderful You are!
 O, how wonderful You are.
