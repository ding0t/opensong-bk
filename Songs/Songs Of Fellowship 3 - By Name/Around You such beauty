[V1]
 Around You such beauty, 
 Your majesty could fill an endless sky: 
 Holy are You, Lord. 
 ||Transcendent, exalted, 
 The heavens cannot contain Your presence: 
 Holy are You, Lord. 
 And as I behold Your glory 
 I'm undone. 
 
[C]
 I bow down at Your feet, 
 I bow down at Your feet, 
 I bow down at Your feet 
 For You are my God, my God. 
 
[V2]
 You saved me, the sinner,
 With crimson red You washed me white as snow:
 How I love You, Lord.
 ||You loved me, the mocker,
 With kindness You won my heart forever:
 How I love You, Lord.
 And as I behold this mercy
 I'm undone.
