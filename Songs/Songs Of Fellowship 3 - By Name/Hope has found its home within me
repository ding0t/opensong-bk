[V1]
 Hope has found its home within me,
 Now that I've been found in You.
 Let all I am be all You want me to be,
 'Cause all I want is more of You,
 All I want is more of You.
 
[V2]
 Let Your presence fall upon us,
 I want to see You face to face;
 Let me live forever lost in Your love,
 'Cause all I want is more of You,
 All I want is more of You.
 
[C]
 I'm living for this cause,
 I lay down my life
 Into Your hands.
 I'm living for the truth,
 The hope of the world,
 In You I'll stand.
 All I want is You.
 
[V3]
 All I want is,
 All I want is You, Jesus.
