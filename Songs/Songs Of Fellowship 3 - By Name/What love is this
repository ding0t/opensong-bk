[V1]
 What love is this, 
 That took my place?
 Instead of wrath,
 You poured Your grace on me. 
 What can I do
 But simply come 
 And worship You? 
 
[C]
 I surrender, I surrender, 
 I surrender all to You. 
 
[V2]
 What love is this
 That comes to save?
 Upon the cross
 You bore my guilt and shame.
 To You alone
 I give my heart
 And worship You.
 
[V3]
 A greater love
 No man has seen;
 It breaks sin's power
 And sets the prisoner free.
 With all I have
 And all I am,
 I worship You.
