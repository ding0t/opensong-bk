[V1]
 O my soul, arise and bless Your maker, 
 For He is your Master and your Friend. 
 Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy: 
 Worship the Saviour, Jesus. 
 
[V2]
 King of grace, His love is overwhelming; 
 Bread of Life, He's all I'll ever need, 
 For His blood has purchased me forever: 
 Bought at the cross of Jesus. 
 
[C]
 And I will sing for all my days 
 Of heaven's love come down. 
 Each breath I take will speak His praise 
 Until He calls me home.
 
[V3]
 When I wake, I know that He is with me;
 When I'm weak, I know that He is strong.
 Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on:
 Safe on the Rock of Jesus.
 
[V4]
 Stir in me the songs that You are singing;
 Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen.
 Give me faith to move in works of power,
 Making me more like Jesus.
 
[V5]
 Then one day I'll see Him as He sees me,
 Face to face, the Lover and the loved;
 No more words, the longing will be over:
 There with my precious Jesus.
