[V1]
 You are the song that I sing,
 A precious melody.
 You are the theme of my heart.
 You are my inspiration.
 
[V2]
 You are the light of my life,
 How I love Your word.
 It leads me closer to You.
 
[C]
 You are my inspiration, You cause me to sing.
 You are my inspiration, the reason I live.
 You are my inspiration, I'm glad I'm alive.
 You are my inspiration.
 
[V3]
 Your greatness creation displays,
 Such wonders to behold.
 In awe I, I live my days.
 
[V4]
 How then can I be silent,
 When my heart is so full?
 In You I have discovered
 The secret of true love,
 And I want the world to know that...
