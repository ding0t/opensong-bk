[C]
 You are the Lord, 
 The famous One, famous One;
 Great is Your name in all the earth.
 The heavens declare
 You're glorious, glorious;
 Great is Your fame beyond the earth.
 
[V1]
 And for all You've done and yet to do,
 With every breath, I'm praising You.
 Desire of nations and every heart,
 You alone are God,
 You alone are God.
 
[V2]
 The Morning Star is shining through,
 And every eye is watching You.
 Revealed by nature and miracles,
 You are beautiful, You are beautiful.
