[V1]
 Are the prayers of the saints
 Like sweet smelling incense, 
 Are the prayers of the saints 
 Like sweet smelling incense to Your heart, 
 To Your heart? 
 
[V2]
 Let these prayers of the saints 
 Be sweet smelling incense, 
 Let these prayers of the saints 
 Be sweet smelling incense to Your heart. 
 
[V3]
 Are the songs of the saints 
 Like sweet smelling incense, 
 Are the songs of the saints 
 Like sweet smelling incense to Your heart, 
 To your heart? 
 (Repeat)
 
[V4]
 Let these songs of the saints 
 Be sweet smelling incense, 
 Let these songs of the saints 
 Be sweet smelling incense to Your heart.
