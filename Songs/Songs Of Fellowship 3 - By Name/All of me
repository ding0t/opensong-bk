[V1]
 All of me, 
 All of me I give to You, 
 Only You, Jesus.
 More of You, 
 More of You I long for,
 Only You, Jesus.
 
[V2]
 For this life I live for You;
 I truly worship You.
 All of my days, in every way,
 I will praise You.
 In thought and word and deed,
 Powered by Your life in me,
 All of my days, in every way,
 I will praise You, Lord.
