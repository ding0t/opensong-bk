[V1]
 We are joined by angels,
 Our purpose the same:
 To worship the one and only God,
 A little piece of heaven is in this place.
 
[C]
 And we cry together: Holy, holy
 For there is no other like You, Lord.
 We declare together: You are awesome,
 You are to be feared, honoured and revered,
 For You are the Lord.
 
[V2]
 We are joined by angels,
 With one voice we sing,
 As we lift our hands to honour You,
 In worship, the angels extend their wings.
