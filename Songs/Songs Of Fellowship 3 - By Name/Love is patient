[V1]
 Love is patient, love is kind,
 It does not envy or speak in pride.
 It does not seek its own reward:
 Oh, that's how You love me, Lord.
 
[V2]
 It always hopes and perseveres,
 It covers over a wealth of sins,
 It shuns all evil, delights in truth:
 Oh, I want to be like You.
 
[C]
 I'm in love with a King,
 I'm in love with a Friend,
 And whatever I do
 This love never ends.
 He's for me, He pleads for me,
 Pours out His life for me;
 What more do I need?
 Amazing love!
 
[V3]
 There are tongues now, but they will cease;
 There is knowledge - it's incomplete.
 For what we know now, we know in part,
 But what endures is a loving heart.
