[V1]
 Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, 
 God of power and might.
 Earth and heaven worship You,
 Your majesty so bright.
 Yet we, Your fallen children know
 Your love beyond compare.
 We lift our hands, surrender 
 To grace so undeserved.
 
[C]
 Before You, Lord, forgiven,
 We bow before Your throne.
 At Your cross, we find in You
 Our righteousness restored.
 Before You, Lord, forgiven,
 We stand in Your great love,
 And live our lives in honour
 To Your forgiving blood.
 
[V2]
 Living in Your presence, Lord,
 Sin and guilt atoned;
 Citizens of heaven, 
 Heirs unto Your throne.
 To be with You in glory,
 To see You face to face,
 At last home with the Father,
 Our holy dwelling place.
