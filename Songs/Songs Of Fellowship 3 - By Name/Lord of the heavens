[V1]
 Lord of the heavens,
 I bow my knee and worship You;
 I stand before You,
 And I am amazed.
 I see Your beauty
 Displayed in everything You do.
 
[V2]
 For You are my Saviour, Lord and King,
 You are the only One for me;
 You are the only One that I adore.
 In Your Son atonement, sacrifice:
 Through His death redemption gives new life,
 And I reach out, receive Your endless love.
