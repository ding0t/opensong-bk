[V1]
 Time is too short to say it's okay,
 To think I can live this way
 For just another day.
 So I'll search through the night
 For the One my heart loves,
 Won't stop till I've found You,
 For Lord, I need to hold You close.
 
[C]
 Be the King of this heart again,
 Be the Lord of this life.
 In my soul there's a cry today:
 Be the King of this heart,
 Be the King of this heart.
 
[V2]
 I've stood in the desert and thirsted for You,
 I've run through the city, now I won't let go:
 I'm throwing myself on Your mercy, O God,
 You say: 'It's all or nothing.'
 I'm saying: 'Jesus have it all.'
 
[V3]
 Be the light for my eyes,
 Be the strength for my feet,
 Be the love of my soul,
 Be my everything.
 Be my day and my night,
 When I wake, when I sleep,
 Undivided my heart will be.
