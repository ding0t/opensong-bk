[V1]
 You are the sovereign 'I am',
 Your name is holy.
 You are the pure, spotless Lamb,
 Your name is holy.
 You are the Almighty One,
 Your name is holy.
 You are the Christ, God's own Son,
 Your name is holy.
 
[V2]
 In Your name
 There is mercy for sin,
 There is safety within,
 In Your holy name.
 In Your name
 There is strength to remain,
 To stand, in spite of pain,
 In Your holy name.
