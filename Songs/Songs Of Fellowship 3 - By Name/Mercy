[C]
 Mercy, mercy, Lord,
 Your mercy is how we are restored;
 Mercy, O mercy, Lord,
 Help us to show Your mercy, Lord.
 
[V1]
 You have been patient with our offences,
 You have forgiven all of our sins;
 We were deserving only Your judgement,
 But Your great mercy triumphed again.
 
[V2]
 Lord, You have taught us, 'Love one another,'
 As You have loved us so we must love;
 Always forbearing, always forgiving,
 Showing to others the mercy we've known.
