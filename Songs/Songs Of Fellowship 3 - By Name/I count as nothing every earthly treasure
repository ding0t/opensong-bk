[V1]
 I count as nothing 
 every earthly treasure, Jesus;
 What You have shown me is that
 You are the source of my life.
 So what else can I do 
 But stay here?
 
[V2]
 Why would I look for
 Any worldly pleasure, Jesus,
 When I have all things in You?
 And just a heartbeat away.
 So what else can I do 
 But stay here with You?
 
[C]
 You're all that I need,
 You're all that I need,
 So here I'll stay
 And give my praise to You.
