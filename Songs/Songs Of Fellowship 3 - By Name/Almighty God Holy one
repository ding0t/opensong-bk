[V1]
 Almighty God, Holy one,
 Who can stand before You,
 Who can come?
 Perfect Lamb, who bore our sin,
 Who deserves such mercy,
 Gracious King?
 
[V2]
 I come to Your throne of grace,
 I'm standing in Christ,
 I'm clothed in His righteousness.
 To know Your presence,
 To seek Your face.
 Father, I delight in Your embrace.
