[V1]
 You are the fountain of my life
 And in Your light I find my reason,
 'Cause Your love reaches to the stars,
 Even the great deep.
 And Your love reaches to this heart
 And it makes me sing.
 
[C]
 Your love reaches me:
 It's what I need, it's what I need.
 Your love reaches me:
 It's what I need, it's what I need.
 
[V2]
 O Lord, how priceless 
 Is Your unending love.
 Both high and low 
 Find refuge in Your shadow.
 (Repeat)
