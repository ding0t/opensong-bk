[C]
 You are Holy, You are mercy,
 You are wonder, You are love.
 You are faithful, You are gracious,
 You are lovely, You are God.
 
[V1]
 I open my eyes so I
 See Your loveliness.
 I open my life so I
 Know Your holiness.
 
[V2]
 If You are for us who could 
 Stand against us?
 Surely You are with us,
 Surely You are with us.
 
[V3]
 Surely You are with us,
 Surely You are with us,
 Surely You are with us,
 Surely You are with us.
