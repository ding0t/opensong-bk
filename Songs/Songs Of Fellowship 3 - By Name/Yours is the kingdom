[C]
 Yours is the kingdom,
 The power and the glory,
 Forever and ever, 
 Forever and ever, Amen!
 (Repeat)
 
[V1]
 A trumpet blast will herald
 The day of Your return:
 Your glory and Your splendour
 Will be seen in all the earth!
 
[V2]
 And oh, what a day,
 Oh, what a day that will be,
 When the earth joins with heaven
 In worship and praise to Jesus!
 
[V3]
 The time is drawing nearer,
 I believe it's coming soon,
 When we will rise to greet You
 As a bride to meet her groom.
