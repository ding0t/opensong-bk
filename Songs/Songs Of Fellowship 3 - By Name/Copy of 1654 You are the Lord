  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are the Lord, the King of heaven 
 And all the earth, You'll reign forever.
 First and the last, You are glorious.
 
[V2]
 Before Your throne the elders fall, 
 And angels sing: 'Almighty God.'
 Bright Morning Star,
 You are glorious, You are glorious.
 
[C]
 To You, the nations will come,
 Every tribe, every tongue
 And worship before You,
 The Ancient of Days,
 The Name above all names,
 Who is worthy of all our praise.
 You are glorious.
 Yeah, You are glorious.
