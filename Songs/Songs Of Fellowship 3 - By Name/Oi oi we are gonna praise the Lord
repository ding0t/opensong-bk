[C]
 Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. 
 Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. 
 Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. 
 He's an exciting, powerising, c-colossal, 
 Humungous-mungous God! 
 
[V1]
 But it's sometimes hard to understand 
 That the God who made the earth and man 
 Would point a finger down from heaven and shout: 
 ||'Hey you! I love you. 
 Hey you! I love you. 
 Hey you, you! 
 I love you', but it's true!
