[V1]
 Thank You, Lord, for Your love to me. 
 By Your truth You have set me free. 
 Through the cross I can enter in. 
 What seemed impossible till I let You 
 Wash away my sin, 
 Take away all shame 
 By the life-giving blood 
 Of Jesus, my Redeemer. 
 
[C]
 Holy, I stand before You, 
 Truly, I am blameless in Your sight. 
 Righteous, a royal robe I don't deserve, 
 Yet You choose to clothe me still, 
 Precious mercy. 
 
[V2]
 Such mercy, such grace, 
 Such kindness to save 
 Even a sinner like me. 
 I'll love You, I'll serve You, 
 I'll praise You forever,
 Thank You, Lord, for Your love to me.
