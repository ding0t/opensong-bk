[V1]
 When I sing my praise to You, 
 I am lifted up to higher ground. 
 Something happens in my soul 
 When I lift my voice to worship You. 
 Feels like sunshine on my face, 
 A cool breeze in a desert place. 
 
[C]
 When I worship You, 
 Heaven comes to me, 
 Heaven comes to me. 
 When I worship You, 
 Heaven comes to me, 
 Heaven comes to me. 
 
[V2]
 Heaven is where I belong, 
 Where the angels sing before Your throne. 
 I am caught up in their sound, 
 When I lift my voice to worship You. 
 From beyond where eyes can see, 
 Love is pouring over me.
 
[C2]
 I will worship You, 
 Heaven come to me, 
 Heaven come to me. 
 I will worship You, 
 Heaven come to me, 
 Heaven come to me.
