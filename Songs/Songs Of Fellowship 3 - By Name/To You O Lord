[V1]
 To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul, 
 In You I trust, O my God. 
 Do not let me be put to shame, 
 Nor let my enemies triumph over me. 
 
[C]
 No one whose hope is in You 
 Will ever be put to shame; 
 That's why my eyes are on You, O Lord. 
 Surround me, defend me, 
 O, how I need You. 
 To You I lift up my soul, 
 To You I lift up my soul. 
 
[V2]
 Show me Your ways and teach me Your paths, 
 Guide me in truth, lead me on; 
 For You're my God, You are my Saviour, 
 My hope is in You each moment of the day.  
 
[V3]
 Remember, Lord, Your mercy and love 
 That ever flow from of old. 
 Remember not the sins of my youth
 Or my rebellious ways.
 According to Your love, remember me, 
 According to Your love, 
 For You are good, O Lord.
