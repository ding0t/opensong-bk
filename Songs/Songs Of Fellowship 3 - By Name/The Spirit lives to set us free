[V1]
 The Spirit lives to set us free,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 He binds us all in unity,
 Walk, walk in the light.
 
[C]
 Walk in the light,
 Walk in the light,
 Walk in the light,
 Walk in the light of the Lord.
 
[V2]
 Jesus promised life to all,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 The dead were wakened by His call,
 Walk, walk in the light.
 
[V3]
 He died in pain on Calvary,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 To save the lost like you and me,
 Walk, walk in the light.
 
[V4]
 We know His death was not the end,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 He gave His Spirit to be our friend,
 Walk, walk in the light.
 
[V5]
 By Jesus' love our wounds are healed,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 The Father's kindness is revealed,
 Walk, walk in the light.
 
[V6]
 The Spirit lives in you and me,
 Walk, walk in the light;
 His light will shine for all to see,
 Walk, walk in the light.
