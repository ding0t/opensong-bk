[V1]
 One thing I have been asking,
 One thing I am looking for:
 To see Your glory and beauty,
 To know Your presence, Lord.
 
[C]
 You're the desire of my heart,
 And You are all that I want;
 You're the desire of my heart,
 And You are all that I want.
 
[V2]
 You have all my attention,
 You are the One I'm living for;
 In You I find satisfaction,
 You are mine and I am Yours.
 
[V3]
 I am wanting You,
 I am needing You much more, Lord.
 You have won my heart,
 You've given me all that You've got,
 Your love was demonstrated on the cross.
 Thank You, Lord!
