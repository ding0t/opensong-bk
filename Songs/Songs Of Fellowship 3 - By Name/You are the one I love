[C]
 You are the one I love,
 You are the One that I adore.
 You are the one I love,
 You are the One that I adore.
 
[V1]
 For You've called me by name,
 Drawn me close to Your heart,
 Washed away all my shame with Your tears.
 For the rest of my days,
 I will offer my life
 In thanksgiving and praise to my King.
 
[V2]
 Now with You I will stay,
 For Your word is my light,
 And Your peace can allay all my fears;
 And my victory song
 Is the song of the cross,
 You have won me love so divine.
 
[V3]
 Such precious, precious love.
