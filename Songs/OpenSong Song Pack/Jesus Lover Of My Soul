.G           D
 I love You, I need You,
.Em                             C
 Thought my world may fall I'll never let You go.
.G          D
 My Savior, my closest Friend,
.Em                             C
 I will worship You until the very end.

.G      D
 Jesus, Lover of my soul,
.Em            C
 Jesus, I will never let You go.
.G               D
 You've taken me from the miry clay,
.Em                 C
 Set my feet upon a rock and now I know.</lyrics></song>
