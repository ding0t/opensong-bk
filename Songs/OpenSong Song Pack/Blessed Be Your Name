.Bb      F                     Gm            Eb
1Blessed be Your name in the   land that is  plentiful,
2Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me,
.           Bb              F              Gm                   Eb
1Where Your streams of a____bundance flow, blessed be Your name;||
2When the   world's "all as it should be", blessed be Your name;||
.Bb          F                     Gm               Eb
1And blessed be Your name when I'm found in the     desert place,
2And blessed be Your name on the   road marked with suffering,
.               Bb               F           Gm                   Eb
1Though I       walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name.
2Though there's pain in the      offering,   blessed be Your name.

[P]
.Bb             F                 Gm           Eb
 Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise,
.Bb                    F                Gm           Eb
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say:

[C]
.               Bb          F                     Gm   Eb
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name;
.               Bb          F                     Gm       Eb
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your glorious name.

[T]
.    Bb             F        Gm             Eb
 You give and take away; You give and take away;
.   Bb                   F          Gm              Eb
 My heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be Your name.</lyrics></song>
