  <lyrics>[V]
.D/F#   G2       Asus              A
 I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken,
.D/F#  G2      Asus        A
 I'm accepted, You were condemned;
.D/F# G2                  Asus          A
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me,
.  G2        A              D
 Because You died and rose again.

 Amazing love, how can it be,
.D                              Asus A
 That You my King would die for me?
.D             G
 Amazing love, I know it's true,
.D                        Asus A
 And it's my joy to honor You;
.         G A         D
 In all I do to honor You.
