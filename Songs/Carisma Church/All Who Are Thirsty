  <lyrics>[C]
 All who are thirsty
 All who are weak
 Come to the fountain
 Dip your heart in the stream of life||
 Let the pain and the sorrow
 Be washed away
 In the waves of His mercy
 As deep cries out to deep||
 (We sing)
 Come Lord Jesus come
 Come Lord Jesus come
 Come Lord Jesus come||
 Holy Spirit come
 Holy Spirit come
 Holy Spirit come
 As deep cries out to deep||
 As deep cries out to deep</lyrics></song>
