  <lyrics>[V1]
 All over the world
 The Spirit is moving
 All over the world
 As the prophets said it would be
 All over the world
 There's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord
 As the waters cover the sea

[V2]
 Deep down in my heart
 The Spirit is moving
 Deep down in my heart
 As the prophets said it would be
 Deep down in my heart
 There's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord
 As the waters cover the sea</lyrics></song>
