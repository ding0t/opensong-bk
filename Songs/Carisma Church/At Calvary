  <lyrics>[V1]
 Years I spent in vanity and pride
 Caring not my Lord was crucified
 Knowing not it was for me He died
 At Calvary

[C]
 Mercy there was great and grace was free
 Pardon there was multiplied to me
 There my burdened soul found liberty
 At Calvary

[V2]
 By God's Word at last my sin I learned
 Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned
 To Calvary

[V3]
 Now I've give to Jesus everything
 Now I gladly own Him as my King
 Now my raptured soul can only sing
 Of Calvary

[V4]
 O the love that drew salvation's plan
 O the grace that brought it down to man
 O the mighty gulf that God did span
 At Calvary</lyrics></song>
