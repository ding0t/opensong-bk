  <lyrics>[V1]
.D/F#        G2      Asus              A
    I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken
.D/F#        G2   Asus             A
    I'm accepted,    You were condemned
.D/F#       G2                Asus          A
    I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
.       G2       A              D
    Because you died and rose again
 
[C]
.D             G
 Amazing love, how can it be
.D                              Asus, A
 That You my king would die for me?
.D             G
 Amazing love, I know it's true
.D                        Asus, A
 And It's my joy to honor You
.          G, A       D
 (In all I do I honor You)
