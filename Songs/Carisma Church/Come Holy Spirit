  <lyrics>[C]
 Come Holy Spirit, I need Thee
 Come sweet Spirit I pray
 Come in Your strength
 And Your power
 Come in your own gentle way

[V1]
 Come as a wisdom to children
 Come as new sight to the blind
 Come Lord as strength to me weakness
 Take me, soul body and mind

[V2]
 Come as a rest to the weary
 Come as a balm for the sore
 Come as a dew to my dryness
 Fill me with joy evermore

[V3]
 Come like a spring in the desert
 Come to the withered of soul
 O let Your sweet healing power
 Touch me and make me whole</lyrics></song>
