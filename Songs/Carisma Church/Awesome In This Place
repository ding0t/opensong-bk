  <lyrics>[V1]
 As I come into Your presence
 Past the gates of praise
 Into Your Sanctuary
 Till we're standing face to face
 I look upon Your countenance
 I see the fullness of Your grace
 And I can only bow down and say

[C]
 You are awesome in this place
 Mighty God
 You are awesome in this place
 Abba Father
 You are worthy of all praise
 To You our lives we raise
 You are awesome in this place
 Mighty God</lyrics></song>
