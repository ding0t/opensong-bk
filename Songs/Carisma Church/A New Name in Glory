  <lyrics>[V1]
 I was once a sinner but I came
 Pardon to receive from my Lord
 This was freely give and I found
 That He always kept His Word
 
[C]
 There's a new name written down in glory
 And it's mine, O yes it's mine
 And the white robed angels
 Tell the story
 A sinner has come home
 For there's a new name written down in glory
 And it's mine, O yes it's mine
 With my sins forgiven
 I am bound for heaven
 Never more to roam</lyrics></song>
