  <lyrics>[V1]
 Father in heaven how we love You
 We lift Your name in all the earth
 May Your kingdom be established
 In our praises
 As your people declare
 Your mighty works

[C]
 Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
 Who was and is and is to come
 Blessed be the lord God Almighty
 Who reigns forevermore</lyrics></song>
