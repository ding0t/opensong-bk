  <lyrics>[V1]
 Down at Your feet O Lord
 Is the most high place
 In Your presence Lord
 We seek Your face
 We seek Your face
 (repeat)

[C]
 For there is no higher calling
 And no greater Honour
 Than to bow and kneel
 Before Your throne
 And I'm amazed at your glory
 Embraced with Your mercy
 O Lord I live to worship You</lyrics></song>
