  <lyrics>[V1]
 Blessed be the Name of the Lord
 He is worthy to be praised and adored
 So we lift up holy hands in one accord
 Singing Blessed be the Name
 Blessed be the Name
 Blessed be the Name of the Lord

[V2]
 Holy is the name of the Lord
 He is worthy to be praised and adored
 So we lift up holy hands in one accord
 Singing Holy is the Name
 Holy is the Name
 Holy is the Name of the Lord

[V3]
 Jesus is the name of the Lord
 He is worthy to be praised and adored
 So we lift up holy hands in one accord
 Singing Jesus is the Name
 Jesus is the Name
 Jesus is the Name of the Lord</lyrics></song>
