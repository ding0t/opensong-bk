  <lyrics>[V] 
 Come into His Presence 
 With thanksgiving in your heart
 And give Him praise, give Him praise
 Come into His Presence 
 With thanksgiving in your heart
 Your voice raise, your voices raise

[C]
 Give glory and honour 
 And power unto Him
 "Jesus"
 The Name above all names.
</lyrics></song>
