  <lyrics>[V1]
 Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?
 And did my Sov'reign die?
 Would He dovote that sacred head
 For such a worm as I?

[C]
 At the cross, at the cross 
 Where I first saw the light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away
 It was there by faith I received my sight
 And now I am happy all the day!

[V2]
 Was it for crimes that I have done
 He groaned upon the tree?
 Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
 And love beyond degree!

[V3]
 Well might the sun in darkness hide
 And shut His glories in
 When Christ the mighty Maker died
 For man the creature's sin

[V4]
 But drops of grief can ne'er repay
 The debt of love I owe
 Here, Lord I give myself away
 Tis all that I can do</lyrics></song>
