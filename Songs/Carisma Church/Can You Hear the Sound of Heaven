 CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF HEAVEN
 LIKE THE SOUND OF MANY WATERS
 IT'S THE SOUND OF WORSHIP
.                Cm    F
 COMING FROM HIS THRONE
.          D#           A#/D
 THERE ARE CRIES OF ADORATION
.   D#             A#/D
 AS MEN FROM EVERY NATION
.Gm
 LIFT THERE VOICE
.   C7             F
 TO MAKE HIS GLORY KNOWN SINGING
[c]
.A#          Dm           D#  Cm
 HOLY, HOLY, HOLY ARE YOU LORD
.F           F/D#         A#/D
 HOLY, HOLY, HOLY ARE YOU LORD
.    D#                F/D#
 THE ELDERS AND ANGELS BOW
.    D                    Gm F
 THE REDEEMED WORSHIP YOU NOW
.D#          F            A#
 HOLY, HOLY, HOLY ARE YOU LORD
