[1]
 There&apos;s a call comes ringing o&apos;er the restless wave:
 Send the light, send the light!
 There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save:
 Send the light, send the light!
 
[C]
 Send the light, the blessed gospel light -
 Let it shine from shore to shore!
 Send the light, the blessed gospel light -
 Let it shine forevermore!
 
[2]
 Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound
 Send the light, send the light!
 And a Christ-like spirit everywhere be found
 Send the light, send the light!
 
[3]
 Let us not grow weary in the work of love
 Send the light, send the light!
 Let us gather jewels for a crown above
 Send the light, send the light!
