<title>My Saviour My God</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I am not skilled to understand
 What God has willed, what God has planned
 I only know at his right hand
 Stands one who is my Savior

[V2]
 I take him at His word and deed
 Christ died to save me: this I read
 And in my heart I find a need
 Of Him to be my Savior

[P1]
   That He would leave His place on high
   And for sinful man to die
   You count it strange, so once did I
   Before I knew my Savior

[C1]
   My Savior Loves, my Savior Lives
   My Savior's always there for me
   My God; He was, my God; He is
   My God; is always gonna be

[V3]
 Yes, living, dying: let me bring
 My Strength, my solace from this spring
 That He who lives to be my King
 Once died to be my Savior

[C2]
   My Savior Loves, my Savior Lives
   My Savior's always there for me
   My God; He was, my God; He is
   My God; is always gonna be</lyrics>
