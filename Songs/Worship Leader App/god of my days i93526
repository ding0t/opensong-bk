<lyrics>[V1]
.                G                 Em7
 You awaken my heart from slumbering
.             Dsus
 Meet me in mourning,
.                       C2
 And You speak to my grief
.                         G
 You're the light in my darkness
.                    Bm
 The delight of my eyes
.                 Em7
 The hope of the daybreak
.                       C2
 When the sun's slow to rise
.     Am7           G/B             C2
 I trust that every moment's in Your hands

[C1]
.  C2                     G
   You're the God of my days
.                    D
   The King of my nights
.                Am7                  C
   Lord of my laughter, sovereign in sorrow
.                            G
   You're the prince of my praise
.                 D
   The love of my life
.            Am7                 C
   You never leave me, You are faithful
   God of my days

[V2]
.              G               Em7
 You unveil my eyes, help me to see
.                Dsus             C2
 The arms of my Father encircling me
.                       G
 You're a constant companion
.              Bm
 I am never alone
.                  Em7
 Your love is the banner
.                    C2
 That's leading me home
.     Am7            G/B            C2
 I trust that every moment's in Your hands</lyrics>
