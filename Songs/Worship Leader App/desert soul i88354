<lyrics>[V1]
 I love You Lord
 But I want to love You more
 I need You God
 But I want to need You more

[P1]
   I'm desperate for a desperate heart
   I'm reaching out, I'm reaching

[C1]
   All that I am is dry bones
   Without You Lord, a desert soul
   I am broken but running
   Towards You God, You make me whole

[V2]
 I'm lost without
 Your creative spark in me, recreate me
 I'm dead inside
 Unless Your resurrection sings

[B1]
   You are exactly what we need
   Only You can satisfy
   You are exactly what we need
   Only You can satisfy</lyrics>
