<lyrics>[V1]
.   G          C          G
 The windows of Heaven are open
.    D
 The blessings are falling tonight
.       D
 Ever since Jesus came into my heart
.                           G
 everything's going just right
. G           C            G
 I gave Him my old tattered old garments
.                         C
 And He gave me a robe of pure white
.                          G
 The windows of Heaven are open
.   D                      G
 And that's why I'm happy tonight</lyrics>
