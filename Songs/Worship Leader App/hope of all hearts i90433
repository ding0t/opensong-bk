<lyrics>[V1]
 The world may fade
 You will remain
 In the midst of the trial
 You will always be, I'll sing
 Our God never fails
 Our God never fails

[V2]
 With hope and light
 You reign over all
 Though my heart may fail
 You will always be, I'll sing
 Our God never fails
 Our God never fails

[P1]
   Praise in the morning
   Praise in the evening
   Praise when I'm laughing
   Praise when I'm grieving
   There will be dancing
   There will be singing
   Upon injustice we will tell of our God

[C1]
   The hope of all hearts
   The hope of all hearts Is you
   Your love never fails
   Your love never fails

[V3]
 With hope and light
 You reign over all
 Though my heart may fail
 You will always be all the same
 Our God never fails
 Our God never fails

[P2]
   Praise in the morning
   Praise in the evening
   Praise when I'm laughing
   Praise when I'm grieving
   There will be dancing
   There will be singing
   Upon injustice we will tell of our God

[C2]
   // The hope of all hearts
   The hope of all hearts Is you
   Your love never fails
   Your love never fails //

[V4]
 In darkness,
 In trial, my soul shall sing
 Of his mercy, and kindness
 Our offering of praise
 Our God never fails
 Our God never fails

[V5]
 In darkness,
 In trial, my soul shall sing
 Of his mercy, and kindness
 Our offering of praise
 Our God never fails
 Our God never fails</lyrics>
