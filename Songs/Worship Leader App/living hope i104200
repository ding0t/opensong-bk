<lyrics>[V1]
.              G                D
 How great the chasm that lay between us
.             C2     Em7           D
 How high the mountain I could not climb
.         G                  D
 In desperation, I turned to heaven
.               C2     D      G
 And spoke Your name into the night

[V2]
.                 C2
 Then through the darkness
.            G
 Your loving kindness
.                 Em7           D
 Tore through the shadows of my soul
.            G                    D
 The work is finished, the end is written
.      C          D      G   C
 Jesus Christ, my living hope

[V3]
.           G                 D
 Who could imagine so great a mercy
.                 C2   Em7              D
 What heart could fathom such boundless grace
.           G                      D
 The God of ages stepped down from glory
.           C2      D       G
 To wear my sin and bear my shame

[V4]
.              C2              G
 The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
.            Em7                D
 The King of kings calls me His own
.           G                  D
 Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
.       C         D       G
 Jesus Christ, my living hope

[C1]
.       C2 G              D              Em7
   Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
.       C2 G             D                Em7
   Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
.           C2           G
   You have broken every chain
.             D              Em7
   There's salvation in Your Name
.  G/D   C2         D      G
   Jesus Christ, my living hope

[V5]
.              G                       D
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise
.            C2 Em7        D
 Your buried body began to breathe
.           G                    D
 Out of the silence, the roaring lion
.             C2           D        G
 Declared the grave has no claim on me

[V6]
.              G                       D
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise
.            C2 Em7        D
 Your buried body began to breathe
.           G                    D
 Out of the silence, the roaring lion
.             C2           D        Em  G/B
 Declared the grave has no claim on me__
.       C2           G/D D G
