<lyrics>[V1]
 Would you believe me if I said
 That we are the ones who can make the change
 In the world today
 Would you believe me if I said
 That all of your dreams in your heart
 Can come true today
 Would you believe me if I said
 That life could be all that you want it to be today

[V2]
 And if I had wings I would fly
 'Cause all that I need, You are
 And if the world caved in around me
 To You I'd still hold on
 'Cause You're all that I believe
 And the one that created me
 Jesus because of You I'm free

[V3]
 Would you believe me if I said
 That God can make miracles happen today
 Would you believe me if I said
 That you don't need to wait for the answers before
 You step out in faith
 Would you believe me if I said
 That nothing is ever impossible for God

[V4]
 And if I had wings I would fly
 'Cause all that I need, You are
 And if the world caved in around me
 To You I'd still hold on
 'Cause You're all that I believe
 And the one that created me
 Jesus because of You I'm free

[V5]
 Just live your life with God inside
 You wont regret one moment of it
 And give all that you can for God, for God

[V6]
 And if I had wings I would fly
 'Cause all that I need, You are
 And if the world caved in around me
 To You I'd still hold on
 'Cause You're all that I believe
 And the one that created me
 Jesus because of You

[V7]
 And if I had wings I would fly
 'Cause all that I need, You are
 And if the world caved in around me
 To You I'd still hold on
 'Cause You're all that I believe
 And the one that created me</lyrics>
