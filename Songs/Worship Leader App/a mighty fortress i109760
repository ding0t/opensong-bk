.G             C      G      C
 A mighty fortress is our God,
.Em         C     G      C
 A bulwark never failing.
.G              C          G   C
 Our helper He, amid the flood
.Em               C    G
 Of mortal ills prevailing.
.    Em        D/F#     G
 For still our ancient foe
.     G       D/F#    Em
 Doth seek to work us woe.
.    Em        D/F#      G
 His craft and power are great,
.     C                Bm
 And, armed with cruel hate,
.C               D/F#    G
 On earth is not his e - qual.

[C1]
.  C    Em  C    G
   Whoooaaa Whoooaaa
.  C    Em  C    G
   Whoooaaa Whoooaaa

[V2]
.G                   C         G   C
 If we in our own strength confide,
.Em                     C  G   C
  Our striving would be losing.
.G                      C       G   C
 Were not the right man on our side,
.Em                     C  G
 The Man of God's own choosing.
.    Em      D/F#     G
 You ask who that may be?
.       G      D/F#  Em
 Christ Jesus, it is He.
.    Em    D/F#      G
 The Lord of Hosts, His name,
.     C              Bm
 From age to age the same,
.C                   D/F#   G
 And He must win the ba - ttle.

[V3]
.   G                C           G      C
 // And though this world, with devils filled,
.Em                 C    G   C
 Should threaten to undo us.
.G                      C        G     C
 We will not fear, for God hath willed
.Em                     C     G
 His truth to triumph through us //

[C2]
.     G                 C      Em
   // A mighty fortress is our God!
.                   C   G
   (His Kingdom is forever!)
.  G                 C      Em
   A mighty fortress is our God!
.                   C   G
   (His Kingdom is forever!) //

[C3]
.     Em          C   G
   // His Kingdom is forever!
.  Em          C   G
   His Kingdom is forever! //

[V4]
.G                    C         G    C
  If we in our own strength confide,
.Em                     C  G
  Our striving would be losing.</lyrics>
