<lyrics>[V1]
 There shall be showers of blessing:
 This is the promise of love;
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 Sent from the Savior above.

[C1]
   Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need:
   Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.

[V2]
 There shall be showers of blessing,
 Precious reviving again;
 Over the hills and the valleys,
 Sound of abundance of rain.

[V3]
 There shall be showers of blessing,
 Precious reviving again;
 Over the hills and the valleys,
 Sound of abundance of rain.

[V4]
 There shall be showers of blessing;
 Send them upon us, O Lord;
 Grant to us now a refreshing,
 Come, and now honor Thy Word.

[V5]
 There shall be showers of blessing:
 Oh, that today they might fall,
 Now as to God we're confessing,
 Now as on Jesus we call!

[V6]
 There shall be showers of blessing,
 If we but trust and obey;
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 If we let God have His way.</lyrics>
