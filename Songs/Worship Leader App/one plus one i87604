<lyrics>[V1]
.E
 You believe in me
.A/C#
 And I believe in you
.B/D#
 And we believe we found something worth,
.A
 holding onto

[V2]
.E
 But we can't stop there
.A/C#
 'Cause that won't be enough
.B/D#
 To make it work, to make it last
.A
 When the life we share gets stuffed

[C1]
.  E              B             F#   A
    But we're not in this thing alone
.  E             B            F#     A
    And we won't get it right on our own
.                  E                     B
   It's gonna take help, it's gonna take faith
.           C#      B       A
   But with you and God and me
.  E        B          E
   One plus one equals three

[V3]
.E
 Three chords in a string
.A/C#
 With two strong brake'
.B/D#
 With one love bigger than us
.A
 Every time we pray

[V4]
.E
 So if we're in the rain
.A/C#
 If we're in the clear
.B/D#
 We're gonna be alright
.A
 'cause all we need, we got right here

[C2]
.  E              B             F#   A
    But we're not in this thing alone
.  E             B            F#     A
    And we won't get it right on our own
.                  E                     B
   It's gonna take help, it's gonna take faith
.           C#      B       A
   But with you and God and me
.  E        B          A
   One plus one equals three
   (2x)

[C3]
.                  E                     B
   It's gonna take help, it's gonna take faith
.           C#      B       A
   But with you and God and me
.  E        B          E
   One plus one equals three</lyrics>
