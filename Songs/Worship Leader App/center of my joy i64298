 Jesus, You're the center of my joy
 All that's good and perfect comes from You
 You're the heart of my contentment
 Hope for all I do
 Jesus, You're the center of my joy

[V2]
 When I've lost my direction
 You're the compass for my way
 You're the fire and light
 When nights are long and cold
 In sadness You are the laughter
 That shatters all my fears
 When I'm all alone
 Your hand is there to hold

[V3]
 Jesus, You're the center of my joy
 All that's good and perfect comes from You
 You're the heart of my contentment
 Hope for all I do
 Jesus, You're the center of my joy

[V4]
 You are why I find pleasure
 In the simple things in life
 You're the music in the meadows and the streams
 The voices of the children, my family and my home
 You're the source and finish of my highest dreams

[V5]
 Jesus, You're the center of my joy
 All that's good and perfect comes from You
 You're the heart of my contentment
 Hope for all I do
 Jesus, You're the center of my joy

[V6]
 Jesus, You are the center of my joy
 Jesus, You are the center of my joy
 Jesus, You are the center of my joy
 Jesus, You are the center of my joy</lyrics>
