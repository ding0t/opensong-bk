<title>Just as I am</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.D                  A       D
 Just as I am, with-out one plea,
.   A    D   A7        G    D
 But that Thy blood was shed for me,
.                   G
 And Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
.  D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

[V2]
.D           A       D
 Just as I am, waiting not,
.   A  D  A7      G   D
 To rid my soul of one dark blot,
.                        G
 To Thee whoses blood can cleanse each spot,
.  D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

[V3]
.D                 A        D
 Just as I am, tho tossed a-bout,
.    A    D A7        G    D
 With many a conflict, many a doubt,
.                        G
 Fightings and fears with-in, without,
. D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

[V4]
.D                   A         D
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind
.      A    D   A7      G      D
 Sight, rich-es, healing of the mind,
.                  G
 Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
. D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

[V5]
.D                  A       D
 Just as I am, Thou wilt re-ceive,
.    A   D     A7      G        D
 Wilt wel-come, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
.                   G
 Because Thy promise I believe,
. D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

[V6]
.D                 A       D
 Just as I am, Thy love un-known,
.   A   D   A7    G   D
 Has bro-ken every bar-rier down;
.                    G
 Now to be Thine yes, Thine alone,
. D              A       D
 O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lyrics>
