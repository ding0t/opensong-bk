<lyrics>[V1]
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon you
 Because He had anointed you
 to preach good news.

[V2]
 The Spirit of the Sovereign God is upon you
 Because He has anointed you
 to preach good news.

[V3]
 He has sent you to the poor.
 (This is the year)
 To bind up the brokenhearted
 (This is the day)
 To bring freedom to the captives
 (This is the year)
 And to release the ones in darkness.

[V4]
 This is the year
 Of the favor of the Lord
 This is the day
 Of the vengeance of our God
 This is the year
 It′s the year of the favor of the Lord
 This is the day
 Of the vengeance of our God

[V5]
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us
 Because He has anointed us
 To preach good news

[V6]
 The Spirit of the Sovereign God is upon us
 Because He has anointed us
 To preach good news.

[V7]
 He will comfort all who mourn
 (This is the year)
 He will provide for those who grieve in Zion
 (This is the day)
 He's pouring out His oil of gladness
 (This is the year)
 Instead of mourning we will praise.

[V8]
 This is the year
 Of the favor of our Lord
 This is the day
 Of the coming of the Lord
 This is the year
 Of the vengeance of our God

[V9]
 He will comfort all who mourn
 (This is the year)
 He will comfort the ones who′ve grieved
 in Zion
 (This is the day)
 He's pouring out the oil of gladness
 (This is the year)
 Instead of mourning

[V10]
 He will comfort all who mourn
 (This is the year)
 He will provide for those who grieve in Zion
 (This is the day)
 He's pouring out His oil of gladness
 (This is the year)
 Instead of mourning we will praise.

[V11]
 We will praise, praise our God
 This is the day

[V12]
