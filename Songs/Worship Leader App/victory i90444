<title>Victory</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 The weapon may be formed but it won't prosper
 When the darkness falls it won't prevail
 Cause the God I serve knows only how to triumph
 My God will never fail
 My God will never fail

[C1]
   I'm gonna see a victory
   I'm gonna see a victory
   For the battle belongs to You Lord
   I'm gonna see a victory
   I'm gonna see a victory
   For the battle belongs to You Lord

[V2]
 There's power in the mighty name of Jesus
 Every war He wages He will win
 I'm not backing down from any giant
 I know how this story ends
 I know how this story ends

[B1]
   You take what the enemy meant for evil
   And You turn it for good
   You turn it for good</lyrics>
