 I can hear my Savior calling,
 I can hear my Savior calling,
 I can hear my Savior calling,
 &quot;Take thy cross and follow,
 follow Me.&quot;

[V2]
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V3]
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V4]
 I'll go with Him through the judgment,
 I'll go with Him through the judgment,
 I'll go with Him through the judgment,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V5]
 He will give me grace and glory,
 He will give me grace and glory,
 He will give me grace and glory,
 And go with me, with me all the way.</lyrics>
