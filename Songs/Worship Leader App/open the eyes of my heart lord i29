.G
 Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
.D
 Open the eyes of my heart.
.          C                  G
 I want to see You. I want to see You. (2X)

[C1]
.             D               Em
   To see You high and lifted up,
.  C                            D
   Shining in the light of Your glory;
.  D                       Em
   Pour out Your power and love,
.             C           D    G
   As we sing holy, holy, holy.

[B1]
.  G
   Holy, holy, holy...
.  D
   Holy, holy, holy...
.  C
   Holy, holy, holy...
.            G
   I want to see You.</lyrics>
