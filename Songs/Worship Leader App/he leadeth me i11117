<lyrics>[V1]
.   D           D/F# G                  D                           A
 He leadeth me! O    blessed thought! O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
.    D          D/F#  G              D          Bm        D  A    D
 Whate'er I do, where'er I be, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

[V2]
.      D             D/F# G                 D                 A
 Lord, I would clasp Thy  hand in mine, Nor ever murmur nor repine,
.   D         D/F# G                D           Bm     D  A    D
 Content, whatever lot I see, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

[V3]
.    D             D/F# G                   D                          A
 And when my task on    earth is done, When by Thy grace the victory's won,
.     D                 D/F# G                    D           Bm     D  A    D
 E'en death's cold wave I    will not flee, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

[C1]
.     D       A      D   G   D              Bm      D       A
   He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:
.      D        A        D G     D       Bm     D       A       D
   His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.</lyrics>
