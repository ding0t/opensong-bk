<title>I love that man from Galilee</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 In a manger long ago, I know it's really so,
 A Babe was born to save men from their sin.
 John saw Him on the shore, the Lamb forevermore,
 Oh, the Christ, the Crucified of Calvary.

[C1]
   Oh, I love that Man from Galilee,
   For He's done so very much for me.
   He's forgiven all my sins, placed the Holy Ghost within;
   Oh, I love that man from Galilee.

[V2]
 The publican went to pray in the temple there one day,
 He cried, &quot;O Lord be merciful to me!&quot;
 He was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace placed within;
 He said, &quot;Come see this Man from Galilee.&quot;

[V3]
 The lame was made to walk, the dumb was made to talk,
 That power was spoken with love upon the sea;
 The blind was made to see, I know it could only be
 The mercy of that Man from Galilee.

[V4]
 Nicodemus came by night, to know the way of right,
 He asked the Son of Man what must he do.
 These words He said to him, &quot;Ye must be born again,&quot;
 By the Spirit of that Man from Galilee.

[V5]
 The woman at the well, He all her sins did tell,
 How five husbands she had at that time,
 She was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace came within;
 Then she cried, &quot;Come see that Man from Galilee!&quot;</lyrics>
