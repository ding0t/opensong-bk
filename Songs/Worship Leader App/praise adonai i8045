<lyrics>[V1]
.Am          F
 Who is like Him
.                 C
 The Lion and the Lamb
.              G
 Seated on the throne
.Am            F
 Mountains bow down
.            C
 Every ocean roars
.               G
 To the Lord of hosts

[V2]
.F            Am
 Praise Adonai
.         G
 From the rising of the sun
.F                     Csus2
 'Til the end of every day
.F            Am
 Praise Adonai
.        G
 All the nations of the earth
.        F
 All the angels and the saints
