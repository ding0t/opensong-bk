<aka>Open up our Eyes, Greater is the One</aka>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Greater is the One who's in us
 Greater is the One who calls our name
 He will never fail

[V2]
 Stronger is the One within us
 Stronger is the One who fights for us
 He will never fail, you will never fail

[C1]
   For your love endures forever
   Oh your love endures forever
   Open up our eyes, surround us with your light
   Your love endures forever

[V3]
 Mighty is the one who's for us
 Mighty is the one, who's strong to save
 He will make a way, you will make a way

[B1]
   Our God is fighting for us always
   Our God is fighting for us all
   Our God is fighting for us always
   We are not alone, we are not alone</lyrics>
