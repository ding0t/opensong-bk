[V2]
 Little girl sitting in her mother's arms with sadness in her eyes
 Doctor said &quot;I'm sorry ma'am, there's just no hope in sight&quot;
 The family gathered around her and on their knees began to pray
 As the tears fell like rain, you could hear her mother say

[C1]
   Lord, I need a miracle today
   Please just let one pass my way
   I believe in You
   Help me overcome this fear inside
   This pain's too much for me to hide
   Lord, see me through
   I need a miracle from You

[V3]
 A drunken man stumbled in the church house 'cause he had no place to go
 The loss of his family left him grieving in his soul
 The preacher stood and spoke of how Jesus loves you anyway
 With the choice he had to run or stay, the man bowed his head and prayed

[C2]
   Lord, I need a miracle today
   Please just let one pass my way
   I believe in You
   Help me overcome this fear inside
   This pain's too much for me to hide
   Lord, see me through
   I need a miracle from You

[V4]
 Little girl is now a wife with kids of her own
 And the man who bowed his head has led many to the throne

[V5]
 Lord, I need a miracle today
 Please just let one pass my way
 I believe in You

[C3]
   Lord, I need a miracle today
   Please just let one pass my way
   I believe in You
   Help me overcome this fear inside
   This pain's too much for me to hide
   Lord, see me through
   I need a miracle from You</lyrics>
