.D                       Asus4    D
 THE LORD'S MY SHEPHERD, I'll not want.
.                   G        Asus4 A7
 He makes me lie in pastures green.
.            G      Asus4  A7    D   G
 He leads me by the still, still waters,
.    Em          Asus4 A7 D
 His goodness restores my soul.

[V2]
.D                   Asus4 D
 And I will trust in You alone.
.    
     (descant) I will Trust, I will Trust in You
.                    G     Asus4 A7
 And I will trust in You alone,
.    
     (descant) I will Trust, I will Trust in You
.         G       Asus4  A7 D       G
 For Your endless  merc__y  follows me,
 (descant) Endless mercy follows me
.     Em            Asus4 A7 D
 Your goodness will lead  me home.

[V3]
.D                    Asus4    D
 He guides my ways in righteousness,
.                  G         Asus4 A7
 And He anoints my head with oil,
.       G      Asus4 A7 D        G
 And my cup, it ove__rflows with joy,
.  Em           Asus4 A7 D
 I feast on His pure  delights.

[V4]
.D                     Asus4   D
 And though I walk the darkest path,
.                    G    Asus4 A7
 I will not fear the evil one,
.            G        Asus4 A7   D       G
 For You are with me, and   Your rod and staff
.        Em        Asus4 A7 D
 Are the comfort I need  to know.</lyrics>
