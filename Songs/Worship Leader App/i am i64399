<lyrics>[V1]
 Show us, more miracles, i-f yo-u are Messiah
 Give us, free bread each day.
 Just like, our father said, as
 He jour-neyed through the wilderness
 But this is, what Jesus had to say

[C1]
   I am, I am the bread of life
   You will never grow hungry
   I am your water, drink and never thirst again
   I am, I am your father; Child, I know you by name
   I am, and I'll never change

[V2]
 He's the Alpha, and Omega
 The beginning, and the end
 He'is the same, as He wa-s back then
 And just like, He raised the dead
 And caused the blind to see
 He'-ll work mira-cles, if we'll just believe.</lyrics>
