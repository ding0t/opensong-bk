<title>I Will Wait for You</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 [Intro]
 Lord, from the depths I call to You
 Lord, hear me from on high
 And give attention to my voice
 When I for mercy cry

[V2]
 Out of the depths I cry to You
 In darkest places I will call
 Incline Your ear to me anew
 And hear my cry for mercy, Lord

[V3]
 Were You to count my sinful ways
 How could I come before Your throne
 Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze
 I stand redeemed by grace alone

[C1]
   I will wait for You
   I will wait for You
   On Your word, I will rely
   I will wait for You
   Surely wait for You
   Till my soul is satisfied

[V4]
 So put your hope in God alone
 Take courage in His power to save
 Completely and forever won
 By Christ emerging from the grave

[V5]
 Now He has come to make a way
 And God Himself has paid the price
 That all who trust in Him today
 Find healing in His sacrifice

[C2]
   I will wait for You
   I will wait for You
   Through the storm and through the night
   I will wait for You
   Surely wait for You
   For Your love is my delight

[V6]
 I pray my soul waits for the Lord
 My hope is in His word
 More than the watchman waits for dawn
 My soul waits for the Lord</lyrics>
