.        C
 All the way my Savior leads me
.          G           C
 What have I to ask beside?
.       F                  G
 Can I doubt His faithful mercies?
.             D                G
 Who through life has been my guide
.          C
 Heavenly peace, divinest comfort
.                         G
 Here by faith in Him to dwell
.       C               F
 For I know whate'er befall me
.       C         G     Am7
 Jesus doeth all things well
.       C               F
 For I know whate'er befall me
.       C         G      C
 Jesus doeth all things well

[V2]
.        C
 All the way my Savior leads me
.             G              C
 Cheers each winding path I tread
.           F                 G
 Gives me strength for every trial
.         D                G
 Feeds me with the living bread
.         C
 Tho' my weary steps may falter
.                         G
 And my soul a-thirst may be
.        C               F
 Gushing from the rock before me
.       C           G Am7
 Is a spring of joy I see.
.         C               F
 Gushing from the rock before me
.       C           G  C
 Is a spring of joy I see.

[V3]
.            D
 And all the way my Savior leads me
.         A               D
 Oh, the fullness of His love
.         G              A
 Perfect rest in me is promised
.      E                A
 In my Father's house above
.         D
 When my spirit clothed immortal
.                                   A
 Wings its flight to realms of the day
.         D                   G
 This my song through endless ages
.      D           A  Bm7
 Jesus led me all the way
.        D                    G
 This my song through endless ages
.       D         A    D
 Jesus led me all the way</lyrics>
