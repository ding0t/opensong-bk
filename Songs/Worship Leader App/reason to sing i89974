   I've got a reason to sing and celebrate
   I was bought by His blood and amazing grace
   I've got a reason to sing and celebrate
   I was bought by His blood and amazing grace

[V1]
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now am found
 Was blind but now I see

[V2]
 Twas grace that taught my heart feat
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures

[V4]
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
 I have already come
 This grace has brought me safe thus far
 And grace will lead me home

[V5]
 When we've been there ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 Than when we first begun</lyrics>
