 I was sinking deep in sin,
 far from the peaceful shore,
 very deeply stained within,
 sinking to rise no more;
 but the Master of the sea
 heard my despairing cry,
 from the waters lifted me;
 now safe am I.

[C1]
   Love lifted me!
   Love lifted me!
   When nothing else could help,
   Love lifted me.
   Love lifted me!
   Love lifted me!
   When nothing else could help,
   Love lifted me.

[V2]
 Souls in danger, look above,
 Jesus completely saves;
 he will lift you by his love
 out of the angry waves.
 He's the Master of the sea,
 billows his will obey;
 he your Savior wants to be -
 be saved today.</lyrics>
