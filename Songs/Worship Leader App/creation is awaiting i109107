<lyrics>[V1]
 Creation is awaiting the return of the King.
 The trees are poised to clap their hands for joy.
 The mountains stand majestic to salute their God;
 The desert lies in wait to burst into bloom.

[C1]
   The King is coming, the King is coming,
   The King is coming, to set creation free.
   The King is coming, the King is coming,.
   The King is coming to set creation free.

[V2]
 The church is awaiting the return of the King.
 The people joined together in his love.
 Redeemed by his blood, washed in his word.
 As a bride longs for her bridegroom the church looks to God.

[C2]
   The King is coming, the King is coming,
   The King is coming to receive his bride.
   The King is coming, the King is coming,
   The King is coming to receive his bride.

[V3]
 The world is awaiting the return of the King.
 The earth is a footstool for his feet.
 Ev'ry knee will bow down, ev'ry tongue confess,
 That Jesus Christ is Lord of heaven and earth.

[C3]
   The King is coming, the King is coming,
   The King is coming to reign in majesty.
   The King is coming, the King is coming,
   The King is coming to reign in majesty.</lyrics>
