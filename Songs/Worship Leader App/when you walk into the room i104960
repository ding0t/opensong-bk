<lyrics>[V1]
 When You walk into the room
 Everything changes
 Darkness starts to tremble
 At the light that You bring
 And when You walk into the room
 Every heart starts burning
 And nothing matters more
 Than just to sit here at Your feet
 And worship You
 We worship You, oh

[V2]
 We love You
 We'll never stop
 We can't live without You, Jesus
 We love You
 And we can't get enough
 All this is for You, Jesus

[V3]
 When You walk into the room
 Sickness starts to vanish
 Every hopeless situation ceases to exist
 And when You walk into the room
 The dead begin to rise
 'Cause there is resurrection life in all You do
 We love You

[V4]
 We'll never stop
 Can't live without You, Jesus
 We love You
 And we can't get enough
 All this is for You, Jesus
 Oh, Jesus

[V5]
 Come and consume, God
 All we are
 We give You permission
 Our hearts are Yours
 We want You, we want You

[V6]
 Come and consume, God
 All we are
 We give You permission
 Our hearts are Yours
 We want You, we want You

[V7]
 Come and consume, God
 All we are
 We give You permission
 Our hearts are Yours
 We want You, we want You

[V8]
 C.ome and consume, God
 All we are
 We give You permission
 Our hearts are Yours
 We want You, we want You
 We love You
 We'll never stop
 Can't live without You, Jesus
 We love You
 And we can't get enough
 All this is for You, Jesus</lyrics>
