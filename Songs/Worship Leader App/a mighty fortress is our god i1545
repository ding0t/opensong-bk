<title>A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.Bb       F        Eb     Bb     Gm      Bb    Eb  F  Bb
 A mighty fortress is our God, a Bulwark never fa__i__ling;
.Bb         F   Eb      Bb       Gm     Bb      Eb  F  Bb
 Our Helper He amid the flood of mortal ills preva__i__ling;
.    Gm        Csus C     F        Bb      Eb      Gm
 For still our an___cient Foe doth seek to work us woe;
.    Gm        Csus  C   F          Gm         Cm    D
 His craft and pow'r are great, and armed with cruel hate,
.   Gm       Bb      Eb FBb
 On earth is not his e__qual.

[V2]
.Bb        F       Eb          Bb        Gm       Bb       Eb  FBb
 Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be lo__sing;
.Bb           F         Eb     Bb        Gm     Bb        Eb F  Bb
 Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choo__sing;
.    Gm       Csus C   F          Bb    Eb    Gm
 Dost ask who that may be: Christ Jesus it is He;
.     Gm   Csus C   F          Gm     Cm      D
 Lord Sabbaoth  His name, from age to age the same,
.    Gm      Bb      Eb FBb
 And He must win the battle.

[V3]
.Bb              F          Eb     Bb            Gm       Bb   Eb F Bb
 And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us;
.Bb          F        Eb       Bb         Gm       Bb      Eb F    Bb
 We will not fear for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:
.    Gm        Csus  C    F        Bb      Eb      Gm
 The prince of dark__ness grim, we tremble not for him;
.    Gm      Csus C F        Gm      Cm      D
 His rage we can  endure for lo, his doom is sure,
.    Gm     Bb         Eb F Bb
 One little word shall fell him.

[V4]
.Bb         F        Eb      Bb        Gm        Bb    Eb FBb
 That Word above all earthly pow'r, no thanks to them abideth;
.Bb         F       Eb        Bb           Gm      Bb      Eb  FBb
 The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us si__deth;
.    Gm        Csus C    F        Bb     Eb     Gm
 Let goods and kin__dred go, this mortal life also;
.    Gm   Csus C   F           Gm     Cm     D
 The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still,
.    Gm      Bb    Eb FBb
 His kingdom is fore__ver!</lyrics>
