 A little talk with Jesus,
 How it smooths the rugged road,
 How it seems to help me onward,
 When I faint beneath my load.
 When my heart is crushed with sorrow,
 And my eyes with tears are dim,
 There's naught can yield me comfort
 Like a little talk with Him.

[V2]
 I tell Him I am weary,
 And I fain would be at rest,
 That I'm daily, hourly longing
 For a home upon His breast;
 And He answers me so sweetly,
 In tones of tenderest love
 &quot;I am coming soon to take thee
 To my happy home above.&quot;

[V3]
 Ah, this is what I'm wanting,
 His lovely face to see;
 And I'm not afraid to say it,
 I know He's wanting me!
 He gave His life a ransom,
 To make me all His own,
 And He can't forget His promise
 To me, His purchased one.

[V4]
 I know the way is dreary
 To yonder far off clime,
 But a little talk with Jesus
 Will wile away the time.
 And yet the more I know Him,
 And all His grace explore,
 It only sets me longing
 To know Him more and more.

[V5]
 I cannot live without Him,
 Nor would I if I could,
 He is my daily portion,
 My medicine and my food,
 He's altogether lovely,
 None can with Him compare,
 The chief among ten thousand,
 The fairest of the fair.

[V6]
 I often feel impatient
 And mourn His long delay,
 I never can be settled
 While He remains away.
 But we shall not long be parted,
 For I know He'll quickly come,
 And we shall dwell together
 In that happy, happy home.

[V7]
 So I'll wait a little longer,
 Till His appointed time,
 And glory in the knowledge
 That such a hope is mine.
 Then in my Father's dwelling,
 Where &quot;many mansions&quot; be,
 I'll sweetly talk with Jesus,
 And He shall talk with me.</lyrics>
