<title>Here in Your Presence</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Found in Your hands, fullness of joy
 Every fear suddenly wiped away
 Here in Your presence
 All of my gains now fade away
 Every crown no longer on display
 Here in Your presence

[P1]
   Heaven is trembling in awe of Your wonders
   the kings and their kingdoms are standing amazed

[C1]
   Here in Your presence, we are undone
   Here in Your presence, Heaven and Earth become one
   Here in Your presence, all things are new
   Here in Your presence, everything bows before You

[B1]
   Wonderful, beautiful, glorious, matchless in every way</lyrics>
