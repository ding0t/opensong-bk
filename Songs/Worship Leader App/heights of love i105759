<lyrics>[V1]
 A proclamation through the land
 It's time for slavery to end
 At the dawning of the promised day
 I ran to the tallest mountain watching for the sun's first ray

[V2]
 From up here I can see all the way to eternity
 From up here there's liberty
 Times no more I am free
 Here the new day has begun
 Here the victory was been won
 There's love divine
 There is peace
 It's where I was born to be

[V3]
 Misunderstandings time and time again
 Never seeming to fit in
 Then he showed me how to use my wings
 The gift that I had hated
 Swept me above all earthly things

[V4]
 From up here I can see all the way to eternity
 From up here there's liberty
 Times no more I am free
 Here the new day has begun
 Here the victory was been won
 There's love divine
 There is peace
 It's where I was born to be

[V5]
 A prisoner running from his fate
 Then he made my crooked path be straight
 What kind of grace could bring me to this place
 There upon the seventh mountain where his love had carved my name

[V6]
 From up here I can see all the way to eternity
 From up here there's liberty
 Times no more I am free
 Here the new day has begun
 Here the victory was been won
 There's love divine
 There is peace
 It's where I was born to be</lyrics>
