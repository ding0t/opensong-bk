<lyrics>[V1]
.   C                        F
 I raise a Hallelujah in the presence of
 my enemies
.   Am                 G
 I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief
.   C                     F
 I raise a Hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
.   Am                 G
 I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight
 for me

.  F            C                   G
   Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my
   praises roar
.  F             C     G          C
   Up from the ashes, hope will arise

   Death is defeated, the King is alive

 I raise a Hallelujah fear you lost your hold
 on me
