 If you catch hell don't hold it
.          Bbm                       Fm
 If you're going through hell don't stop
.        Fm
 Remember no weapon formed against you shall prosper
.                                   Bbm             Fm
 Every tongue that rises against you, you shall condemn

 Greater is He that is in you than He that's in the world [2X]

 Go ahead; go ahead [5X]

 Goin' through; goin' through [5X]
