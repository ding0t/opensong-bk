 The more I find You

 The more I love You

[C1]
.  F
   I wanna sit at your feet
.  C
   Drink from the cup in Your hands
.  Dm
   Lay back against You and breathe
.  Bb
   Feel Your heart beat

   This love is so deep
.  C
   It's more than I can stand
.  Dm
   I Melt in Your peace
.  Bb
   It's overwhelming</lyrics>
