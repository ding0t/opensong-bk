.Bb                           F
 He counts the stars one and all
.                                  Gm
 He knows how much sand is on the shores
.               F            Eb
 He sees every sparrow that falls
.Bb                             F
 He made the mountains and the seas
.                         Gm
 He's in control of everything
.           F                Eb
 Of all creatures great and small

[C1]
.                   Bb
   And He knows my name
.                     F
   Every step that I take
.                     Gm
   Every move that I make
.         F           Eb
   Every tear that I cry
.               Bb
   He knows my name
.                               F
   When I'm overwhelmed by the pain
.                              Gm
   And can't see the light of day
.          F            Eb
   I know I'll be just fine
.      
       Bb Eb Bb
   'Cause He knows my name

[V2]
 I don't know what tomorrow will bring
 I can't tell you what's in store
 I don't know a lot of things
 I don't have all the answers
 To the questions of life
 But I know in whom I have believed

[B1]
.  Ebm           Db           Ebm          F
   He knew who I was when He carried the cross
.  Ebm                               Fsus4        F
   He knew that I would fail Him but He took the loss

[C2]
.                   Db
   And He knows my name
.                     Ab
   Every step that I take
.                     Bbm
   Every move that I make
.         Ab         Gb
   Every tear that I cry
.               Db
   He knows my name
.                               Ab
   When I'm overwhelmed by the pain
.                             Bbm
   And can't see the light of day
.          Ab           Gb
   I know I'll be just fine
.                      Db
   'Cause He knows my name

[C3]
.                     Ab
   Every step that I take
.                     Bbm
   Every move that I make
.         Ab          Gb
   Every tear that I cry
.                     Db
