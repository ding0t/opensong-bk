<lyrics>[V1]
 Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention
 I want to introduce to you
 Here in this corner for the good and the right
 Stands a champion robed in white
 His height exceeds the heavens, His weight outweighs the world
 His reach reaches everywhere, His age is evermore
 He is higher than the highest
 He is greater than the great
 No one could ever take His crown away
 He is more mighty than the mightiest, He reigns from above
 He is the all-time undisputed, undefeated champion of love
 He left His hometown to enter this arena
 To raise His hands in victory for me
 An angry crowd crucified this king who wore their crown
 And they gladly watched the champion going down
 But I will never count Him out, for I'm a witness of
 Oh, the day He rose to reclaim the title &quot;Champion of Love&quot;
 He is higher than the highest, greater
 He is greater than the great
 No one could ever take His crown away
 He is more mighty than the mightiest, He reigns from above
 He is higher than the highest, greater
 Greater than the great
 No one could ever take His crown away
 He is more mighty than the mightiest, He reigns from above
 He is the all-time undisputed, undefeated champion
 The all-time undisputed, undefeated champion
 The all-time undisputed, undefeated champion
 Of Love
 Of Love</lyrics>
