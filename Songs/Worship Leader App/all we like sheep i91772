<title>All We Like Sheep</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 All we like sheep
 Have gone astray
 Each of us turning our
 Own seperate way
 We have all sinned and
 Fallen short of Your glory
 But Your glory is what we desire to see
 And in Your presence is where
 We long to be

[C1]
   Oh Lord
   Show us your mercy and grace
   Take us to Your holy place
   Forgive our sin and heal our land
   We long to live
   In Your presence once again

[V2]
 Taking our sickness
 Taking our pain
 Jesus the sacrifice lamb
 Has been slain
 He was despised, rejected
 By men He took our sin
 Draw us near to You Father
 Through Jesus Your son
 Let us worship before You
 Cleansed by Your Blood</lyrics>
