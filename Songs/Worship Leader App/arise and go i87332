 Arise and go,
 Let's tell the whole wide world:
 Jesus is Lord, He is our Saviour
 Arise and go,
 Let's tell the whole wide world:
 Jesus is Lord, He is our Saviour

[P1]
   He has chosen us for the harvest
   in these days of revival
   to be messengers of freedom
   and salvation
   He has anointed us
   with His Holy Spirit
   to proclaim His kingdom to the earth

[C1]
   // We will go and make disciples
   There is no one who could stop us
   For God is with us, God is with us
   His power is with us //</lyrics>
