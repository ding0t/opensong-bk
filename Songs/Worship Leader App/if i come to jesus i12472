<title>If I Come to Jesus</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 If I come to Jesus,
 He will make me glad;
 He will give me pleasure
 When my heart is sad.

[C1]
   If I come to Jesus,
   Happy I shall be.
   He is gently calling
   Little ones like me.

[V2]
 If I come to Jesus
 He will hear my prayer;
 He will love me dearly,
 He my sins did bear.

[C2]
   Refrain
   If I come to Jesus
   He will take my hand,
   He will kindly lead me
   To a better land.

[C3]
   Refrain
   There with happy children,
   Robed in snowy white,
   I shall see my Savior
   In that world so bright.

[C4]
