 Lord, I come, I confess
.        Em7   D       Cadd9
 Bowing here I find my rest

 Without You I fall apart

 You're the One that guides my heart

   Lord, I need You, oh, I need You

   So teach my song to rise to You

   When temptation comes my way
.          C      G         D       Em
   When I cannot stand I'll fall on You
.   C                D       G   C
   Jesus, you're my hope and stay</lyrics>
