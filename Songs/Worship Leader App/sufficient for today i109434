<lyrics>[V1]
 There will be storms
 That won't move out of my way
 And trials will come to only test my faith
 What I've learned about Your favor
 Your mercy and Your grace
 They go on forever and they're sufficient for today

[C1]
   Hallelujah (3x)
   Is sufficient for today

[V2]
 When I'm worried about tomorrow
 I won't be overwhelmed
 The burdens that I've carried
 I will choose to lay them down
 What I've learned about your favor
 Your mercy and Your grace
 They go on forever and they're sufficient for today

[V3]
 In the joy and in the sorrow
 I find you just the same
 Behind my darkest mornings
 There's a peace I can't explain
 I'm so grateful for your favor
 Your mercy and your grace
 They go on forever and they're sufficient for today

[V4]
 One day I'll finally see you
 And my faith will be my sight
 All my present sufferings
 Will be fine and left behind
 I'll be standing in your favor
 Your mercy and your grace
 They'll go on forever
 They still go on forever
 All glory to your name</lyrics>
