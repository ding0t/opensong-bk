 Wonderful Merciful Savior
 Precious Redeemer and Friend
 Who would have thought that a Lamb could
 Rescue the souls of men, Oh You rescue the souls of men

[V2]
 Counselor, Comforter, Keeper
 Spirit we long to embrace
 You offer hope when our hearts have
 Hopelessly lost the way, Oh we hopelessly lost the way

[V3]
 You are the One that we praise
 You are the One we adore
 You give the healing and grace our
 Hearts always hunger for, Oh our hearts always hunger for

[V4]
 Almighty infinite Father
 Faithfully loving Your own
 Here in our weakness You find us
 Falling before Your throne, Oh we're falling before Your throne</lyrics>
