<lyrics>[V1]
.A             E
 It used to be darkness
.Bm      D
 Without you

[V2]
.A                  E
 I lived my life in blindness
.Bm          D
 But now I'm found

[V3]
.         A     E      Bm         D
 And I'll sing, sing I love you so
.         A
 And I'll sing
.            G                 D
 Because the world can't take away
.     Dm
 Your love

[V4]
.A           E       Bm
 Found me in weakness
.     D
 Broken
.A                 E       Bm
 You came to me in kindness
.          D
 And now I live

[V5]
.A         E           Bm   D
 I give my life for you Lord
.E
 For all you've done</lyrics>
