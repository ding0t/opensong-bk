<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 It's hard to take the first step
 When I don't know the way
 Each turn is so uncertain
 I learn to walk by faith
 But you gave me a promise
 That you would never leave
 You will lead and guide me
 Lord, I do believe

[C1]
   CHORUS
   Lead me Lord, I will follow
   Lead me Lord, I will go
   You have called me
   I will answer
   Lead me Lord, I will go

[V2]
 Your plans for me are perfect
 I never need to fear
 For though in times I feel alone
 I know that You are near
 My heart just wants to follow
 I'm willing to obey
 Take my hand and lead me
 I'll follow all the way!</lyrics>
