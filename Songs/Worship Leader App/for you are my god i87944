<lyrics>[C1]
   For you are my god; you alone are my joy. Defend me, O Lord!

[V1]
 You give marvelous comrades to me;
 the faithful who dwell in your land.
 Those who choose alien gods
 have chosen an alien band.

[V2]
 You are my portion and cup;
 it is you who I claim for my prize.
 Your heritage is my delight,
 the lot you have given to me.

[V3]
 Glad are my heart and my soul;
 securely my body shall rest.
 For you will not leave me for dead,
 nor lead your beloved astray.

[V4]
 You show me the path for my life;
 in your presence the fullness of joy.
 To be at your right hand forever
 for me would be happiness always.</lyrics>
