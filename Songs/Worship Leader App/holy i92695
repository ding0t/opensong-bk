<lyrics>[V1]
 This is the story of the Son of God
 Hanging on the cross for me
 But it ends with a bride and groom
 And a wedding by a glassy sea
 O death where is your sting
 Cause I'll be there singing
 Holy Holy Holy
 Is the Lord

[V2]
 This is the story of a bride in white
 Waiting on her wedding day
 Anticipation welling up inside
 While the groom is crowned as king
 O death where is your sting
 Cause we'll be there singing
 Holy Holy Holy is the Lord
 Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy

[V3]
 Is the Lord Almighty
 Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy
 Is the Lord Almighty
 Who was and is and is to come
 Who was and is and is to come
 This is the story of the Son of God
 Hanging on the cross for me
 And it ends with a bride and groom
 And a wedding by a glassy sea

[V4]
 This is the story of the a bride in white
 Singing on her wedding day
 Of the God who was and is to stand before a bride who sings
 Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy is the Lord Almighty</lyrics>
