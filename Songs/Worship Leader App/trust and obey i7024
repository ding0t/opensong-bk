<lyrics>[V1]
 When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, What a glory He sheds on our way!
 Let us do His good will, He abides with us still,
 And with all who will trust and obey.

[C1]
   Trust and obey, for there's no other way
   To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

[V2]
 Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
 But our toil He doth richly repay;
 Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,
 But is blessed if we trust and obey.

[V3]
 Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.
 Or we'll walk by His side in the way.
 What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
 Never fear, only trust and obey.</lyrics>
