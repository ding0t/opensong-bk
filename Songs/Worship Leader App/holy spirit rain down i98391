<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Spirit rain down, rain down.
 Oh comforter and friend,
 how we need your touch again.

[V2]
 Holy Spirit rain down, rain down.
 Let your power fall, let your voice be heard.
 Come and change our hearts, as we stand on Your word.
 Holy Spirit, rain down. (repeat)

[B1]
   No eye has seen, nor ear has heard,
   no mind can know what God has in store.
   So open up heaven, open it wide,
   over Your church, and over our lives. (repeat)

[V3]
 Holy Spirit rain down, rain down.
 Oh comforter and friend,
 how we need your touch again.

[V4]
 Holy Spirit rain down, rain down.
 Let your power fall, let your voice be heard.
 Come and change our hearts, as we stand on Your word.
 Holy Spirit, rain down. (repeat)</lyrics>
