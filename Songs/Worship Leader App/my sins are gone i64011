<lyrics>[V1]
 You ask me why I'm happy
 So I'll just tell you why,
 Because my sins are gone;
 And when I meet the scoffers
 Who ask me where they are,
 I say, my sins are gone.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   They're underneath the Blood,
   Of the Cross of Calvary,
   As far removed as darkness
   is from dawn;
   In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
   That's good enough for me,
   Praise God, my sins are gone.

[V2]
 'Twas at the old-time altar
 Where God came in my heart,
 And now my sins are gone;
 The Lord took full possession,
 The devil did depart,
 I'm glad my sins are gone.

[V3]
 When Satan comes to tempt me
 And tries to make me doubt,
 I say, my sins are gone;
 You got me into trouble,
 But Jesus got me out,
 I'm glad my sins are gone.

[V4]
 I'm living now for Jesus,
 I'm happy night and day,
 Because my sins are gone;
 My soul is filled with music,
 With all my heart I say,
 I know my sins are gone.</lyrics>
