.Em        C           G     Em       C           G
 Water You turned into wine, open the eyes of the blind
.               Am                  D
 There's no one like You, none like You

[V2]
.Em       C            G      Em         C        G
 Into the darkness You shine, out of the ashes we rise
.               Am                  D
 There's no one like You, none like You

[C1]
.  Em                  C
   Our God is greater, Our God is stronger,
.  G                       D
   God You are higher than any other
.  Em                 C                 G            D
   Our God is Healer, awesome in power, our God, our God...

[B1]
.  Em                        C
   And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us,
.  G                          D                   Em C Bm D
   And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?</lyrics>
