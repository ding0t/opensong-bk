<aka>Jesus, Lover of My Soul</aka>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
 All consuming fire is in Your gaze.
 Jesus, I want You to know
 I will follow You all my days.
 For no-one else in history is like You,
 And history itself belongs to You.
 Alpha and Omega, You have loved me,
 And I will share eternity with You.

[C1]
   It's all about you, Jesus,
   And all this is for You,
   For Your glory and Your fame.
   It's not about me,
   As if You should do things my way;
   You alone are God, and I surrender
   To Your ways.</lyrics>
