<lyrics>[V1]
.      G
 Our fight is with weapons unseen
.       Em
 Your enemies crash to their knees
.                   C
 As we rise up in worship
.       Em.                   D/F#
 When trials unleash like a flood
.      G.
 The battle belongs to our God
.                   C.   Am
 As we cry out in worship

[C1]
.  Em.             C
   The victory is Yours
.                         G
   You're riding on the storm
.        D
   Your name is unfailing
.  Em.                       C
   Though kingdoms rise and fall
.                             G
   Your throne withstands it all
.        D.        C
   Your name is unshaken

[V2]
.G
 What hell meant to break me has failed
.      Em
 Now nothing will silence my praise
.                   C
 I will cry out in worship
.     Em.                       D/F#
 The walls of the prison will shake
.      G
 The chain breaking King will rise to save
.                    C.  Am
 As we cry out in worship

[B1]
.  C.                  D
   You roar like thunder
   Nothing can tame
.         Em
   A God all powerful
.  B#m
   All powerful
.  C
   We pull down Heaven
.  D
   With shouts of praise
.  Em
   A God all powerful
.  B#m
   All powerful</lyrics>
