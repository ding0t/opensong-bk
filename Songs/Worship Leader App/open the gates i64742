<lyrics>[B1]
   Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna

[C1]
   Open the gates
   Here comes the King of Glory
   Lift up your voice and sing
   Let us rejoice
   Our God has come to save us
   Hosanna hosanna hosanna

[V1]
 The broken in spirit (The broken in spirit)
 The humble will hear it (The humble will hear it)
 His invitation (His invitation)
 To join the celebration

[V2]
 His army assembles (His army assembles)
 The enemy trembles (The enemy trembles)
 Our God is with us (Our God is with us)
 His Word is victorious

[V3]
 Before His splendor (Before His splendor)
 Kings will surrender (Kings will surrender)
 Bow down before Him (Bow down before Him)
 Worship and adore Him</lyrics>
