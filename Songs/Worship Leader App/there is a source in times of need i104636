 There is a source In times of need
 That Gives me hope, That Brings Me Peace
 In Every Trial, Through Every Test
 My Saviour Stands
 In My Defence (Hallelujah)

[V2]
 CHORUS
 So When The Road You Walk
 Leaves You Tired And Worn
 And All Your Strength Is gone
 And Your Heart Feels Torn
 Remember God Is greater Than the Storm
 Take Courage For
 The battle is the Lord's.

[V3]
 And When The Waters Rise
 He Calls My Name
 And bids me come Out On The Wave,
 He Holds My Hand Lest I should I falter,
 And He Makes Me Stand Upon The Water

[V4]
 CHORUS
 So When The Road You Walk
 Leaves You Tired And Worn And
 All Your Strength Is gone
 And Your Heart Feels Torn
 Remember God Is greater Than the Storm
 Take Courage For
 The battle is the Lord's.</lyrics>
