<lyrics>[C1]
   Come let us go up to Zion
   Let us draw near to the Lord our God;
   Come let us go up to Zion
   Let us draw near to the presence of the Lord.

[V1]
 You have not come to a desert mountain
 But you have come to The Living God
 You have come to The Heavenly city
 The New Jerusalem

[B1]
   And there are thousands and thousands of angels
   rejoicing before the Throne
   This is the Kingdom that cannot be shaken
   Worship God alone !

[V2]
 You have come to The Judge of the ages
 Unto Jesus and to His Blood;
 You have come to the church of the firstborn
 and to the righteous ones.</lyrics>
