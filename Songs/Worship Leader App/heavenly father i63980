<lyrics>[V1]
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate you,
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate you,
 I love you, adore you,
 I bow down before you,
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate you.

[V2]
 Holy Spirit You're a comfort to me
 Holy Spirit You're a comfort to me
 You lead me, You guide me,
 You're dwelling inside me
 Holy Spirit You're a comfort to me.</lyrics>
