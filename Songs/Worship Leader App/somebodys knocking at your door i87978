<lyrics>[V1]
 Somebody's knockin' at your door,
 Somebody's knockin' at your door,
 O sinner, why don't you answer?
 Somebody's knockin' at your door.

[V2]
 Knocks like Jesus,
 Somebody's knockin' at your door;
 Knocks like Jesus,
 Somebody's knockin' at your door.

[C1]
   O sinner, why don't you answer?
   Somebody's knockin' at your door.

[V3]
 Can't you hear him?...

[V4]
 Jesus calls you,...

[V5]
 Can't you trust him?...</lyrics>
