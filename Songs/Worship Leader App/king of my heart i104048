<lyrics>[V1]
.        G
 Let the King of my heart
.       C                G
 Be the mountain where I run
.    Em               D
 The fountain I drink from
.      C      G
 Oh, He is my song
.        G
 Let the King of my heart
.       C              G
 Be the shadow where I hide
.     Em           D
 The ransom for my life
.     C       G
 Oh, He is my song

[C1]
.          Em   D     C  G
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh

[V2]
.        G
 Let the King of my heart
.       C              G
 Be the wind inside my sails
.    Em            D
 The anchor in the waves
.       C     G
 Oh, He is my song
.        G
 Let the King of my heart
.       C              G
 Be the fire inside my veins
.    Em         D
 The echo of my days
.      C     G
 Oh he is my song

[C2]
.          Em   D     C  G
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh
   You are good, good, ohh

[C3]
.      G
   /// You're never gonna let
   Never gonna let me down ///

[C4]
   And when the night is holding onto me
   God is holding on</lyrics>
