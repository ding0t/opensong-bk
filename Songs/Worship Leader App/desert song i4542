<lyrics>[V1]
 This is my prayer in the desert
 When all that's within me feels dry
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need
 My God is the God who provides

[V2]
 And this is my prayer in the fire
 In weakness or trial or pain
 There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
 So refine me Lord through the flame

[C1]
   And I will bring praise, I will bring praise
   No weapon formed against me shall remain
   I will rejoice, I will declare
   God is my victory and He is here

[V3]
 And this is my prayer in the battle
 When triumph is still on its way
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
 So firm on His promise I'll stand

[B1]
   All of my life in every season
   You are still God
   I have a reason to sing
   I have a reason to worship

[V4]
 And this is my prayer in the harvest
 When favour and providence flow
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again
 The seed I've received I will sow</lyrics>
