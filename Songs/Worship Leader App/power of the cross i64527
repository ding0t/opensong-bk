 Oh, to see the dawn
 Of the darkest day:
 Christ on the road to Calvary.
 Tried by sinful men,
 Torn and beaten, then
 Nailed to a cross of wood.

[C1]
   This, the pow'r of the cross:
   Christ became sin for us;
   Took the blame, bore the wrath-
   We stand forgiven at the cross.

[V2]
 Oh, to see the pain
 Written on Your face,
 Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
 Ev'ry bitter thought,
 Ev'ry evil deed
 Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

[V3]
 Now the daylight flees;
 Now the ground beneath
 Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
 Curtain torn in two,
 Dead are raised to life;
 &quot;Finished!&quot; the vict'ry cry.

[V4]
 Oh, to see my name
 Written in the wounds,
 For through Your suffering I am free.
 Death is crushed to death;
 Life is mine to live,
 Won through Your selfless love.

[C2]
   This, the pow'r of the cross:
   Son of God-slain for us.
   What a love! What a cost!
   We stand forgiven at the cross.</lyrics>
