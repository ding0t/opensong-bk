 Thank you for giving me the morning.
 Thank you for ev'ry day that's new.
 Thank you that I can know my worries can be cast on you.

[V2]
 Thank you for all my friends and brothers.
 Thank you for all the men that live.
 Thank you for even greatest enemies I can forgive.

[V3]
 Thank you, I have my occupation.
 Thank you for ev'ry pleasure small.
 Thank you for music, light and gladness.
 Thank you for them all.

[V4]
 Thank you for many little sorrows.
 Thank you for ev'ry kindly word.
 Thank you for ev'rywhere your guidance reaches ev'ry land.

[V5]
 Thank you, I see your Word has meaning.
 Thank you, I know your Spirit here.
 Thank you because you love all people,
 those both far and near.

[V6]
 Thank you, O Lord, you spoke unto us.
 Thank you that for our words you care.
 Thank you, O Lord, you came among us,
 bread and wine to share.

[V7]
 Thank you, O Lord, your love is boundless.
 Thank you that I am full of you.
 Thank you, you make me feel so glad
 and thankful as I do.</lyrics>
