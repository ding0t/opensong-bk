<lyrics>[V1]
 I want to praise You Lord
 Much more than I do
 I want to praise You lord
 Much more than I do
 Learn to seek Your face
 And the knowledge of Your grace
 I want to praise You

[V2]
 Birds in the sky sing their songs to You
 Trees in the fields lift their arms to You
 I want to sing I want to lift my arms to You

[V3]
 I want to love You Lord
 Much more than I do
 I want to love You lord
 Much more than I do
 Learn to seek Your face
 And the knowledge of Your grace
 I want to love You

[V4]
 Birds in the sky sing their songs to You
 Trees in the fields lift their arms to You
 I want to sing I want to lift my arms to You

[V5]
 I want to serve You lord....</lyrics>
