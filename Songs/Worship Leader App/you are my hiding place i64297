<lyrics>[V1]
 You are my hiding place, O Lord
 You saved me from distress
 You are my hiding place
 You saved me from distress
 You surround my soul
 With cries of deliverance

[C1]
   Chorus
   You are my hiding place, O Lord
   You gaze into the secrets of my soul

[V2]
 Let every good man pray to you
 In his hour of need
 Flood waters may reach high
 But him they shall not reach
 Let every good man pray
 In his hour of need

[V3]
 A hidden secret wastes my frame
 I groan through the night
 And cry through the day
 I will confess my sin
 My guilt I will not hide
 I will confess my pride
 And God wil forgive</lyrics>
