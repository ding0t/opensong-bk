 My hope is in the Lord.
 From this time on and evermore
 Oh, my hope is in the Lord
 Forevermore.

[V2]
 I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord,
 In whom the wisdom of the ages lies.
 From whom the raging of the sea subsides,
 The living sacrifice, nhe only source of life.

[V3]
 His tender mercies come with ev'ry rising sun
 To meet the sinner in his brokenness,
 To offer healing and forgiveness,
 And those who trust in Him will find their hearts at rest.</lyrics>
