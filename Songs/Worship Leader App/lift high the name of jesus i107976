<lyrics>[V1]
 Lift high the name of Jesus,
 Of Jesus our King.
 Make known the power of His grace,
 The beauty of His peace.
 Remember how His mercy reached
 And we cried out to Him.
 He lifted us to solid ground,
 To freedom from our sin.

[C1]
   Oh sing my soul,
   And tell all He's done,
   Till the earth and heavens are filled
   with His glory!

[V2]
 Lift high the name of Jesus,
 Of Jesus our Lord.
 His power in us is greater than,
 Is greater than this world.
 To share the reason for our hope,
 To serve with love and grace,
 That all who see Him shine through us
 Might bring the Father praise.

[V3]
 Lift high the name of Jesus,
 Of Jesus our Light.
 No other name on earth can save,
 Can raise a soul to life.
 He opens up our eyes to see
 The harvest He has grown.
 We labor in His fields of grace
 As He leads sinners home.</lyrics>
