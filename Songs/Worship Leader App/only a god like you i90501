 For the praises of man
 I will never ever stand
 For the kingdoms of this world
 I'll never give my heart away or shout my praise

[V2]
 My allegiance and devotion
 My heart's desire and all emotion
 Oh, go to serve The Man who died upon that tree

[C1]
   Only a God like You
   could be worthy of my praise
   and all my hope and faith
   To only a King of all kings
   Do I bow my knee and sing
   Give my everything

[B1]
   To only my Maker, my Father, my Savior
   Redeemer, Restorer, Rebuilder, Rewarder
   To only a God like you, do I give my praise</lyrics>
