<lyrics>[V1]
.G
 Standing on the promises of Christ, my King!
.C                            G
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring;
.G
 &quot;Glory in the highest!&quot; I will shout and sing,
.                Am   D      G
 Standing on the promises of God.

[C1]
.  G         C   Em
   Standing, standing,
.  D                           G         C  G
   Standing on the promises of Christ my Saviour;
.            C
   Standing, standing
.      G               Dsus D      G
   I'm standing on the promises of God.

[V2]
.G
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
.C                                    G
 When the howling storms of doubt and fears assail,
.G
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
.                Am   D      G
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V3]
.G
 Standing on the promises, I now can see
.C                                 G
 Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
.G
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
.                Am   D      G
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V4]
.G
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
.C                         G
 Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
.G
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
.                Am   D      G
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V5]
.G
 Standing on the promises, I cannot fall,
.C                             G
 List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call,
.G
 Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-All,
.                Am   D      G
 Standing on the promises of God.</lyrics>
