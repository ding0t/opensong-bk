..G                               D7
 One golden daybreak Jesus will come
..                                  G
 One golden daybreak, battles all won;
..G7
 We'll shout the victory
..C                 Am
 break through the blue
..C#dim7      G             D7      G
 One golden daybreak, for you, for me

[V2]
..G
 Won't it be wonderful there
..                     D7
 having no burdens to bear
..G                     C               G
 Joy bells ringing with angels all singing
..            D7        G
 Won't it be wonderful there</lyrics>
