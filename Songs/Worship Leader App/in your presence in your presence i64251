<lyrics>[V1]
 In Your Presence,
 In Your Presence there is peace.
 In Your Presence,
 in Your Presence there is joy.
 I will linger, I will stay in Your Presence
 Day by day, 'till your likeness may be seen in me.

[V2]
 Carried away, carried away, with my Lord,
 Carried away, carried away, with my Lord.
 Let me linger, let me stay in Your Presence
 Day by day, 'till your likeness may be seen in me.

[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy, holy is my Lord.
 Holy, holy, holy, holy is my Lord.
 I will linger, I will stay in Your Presence
 Day by day, 'till your likeness may be seen in me.</lyrics>
