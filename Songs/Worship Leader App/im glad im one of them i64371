 There are people almost everywhere,
 Whose hearts are all aflame,
 With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
 Which cleansed and made them clean;
 It is burning now within my heart,
 All glory to His name!
 I'm so glad that I can say
 I'm one of them!

[C1]
   CHORUS
   One of them, one of them,
   I'm so glad that I can say
   I'm one of them!
   One of them, one of them,
   I'm so glad that I can say
   I'm one of them!

[V2]
 Though these people may not
 learned be,
 Nor boast of worldly fame,
 They have all received their Pentecost,
 Baptized in Jesus' name;
 And are telling now, both far and wide,
 His pow'r is yet the same,
 I'm so glad that I can say
 I'm one of them!

[V3]
 They were gathered in the upper room,
 All praying in His name,
 They were baptized with the
 Holy Ghost,
 And pow'r for service came;
 Now what He did for them that day
 He'll do for you the same;
 I'm so glad that I can say
 I'm one of them!

[V4]
 Come, my brother, seek this blessing
 That will cleanse your heart from sin,
 That will start the joy-bells ringing
 And will keep the soul aflame;
 It is burning now within my heart,
 All glory to His name,
 I'm so glad that I can say
 I'm one of them!</lyrics>
