<lyrics>[V1]
 How can it be, the One who died
 Has borne our sin through sacrifice
 To conquer every sting of death
 Sing, sing hallelujah
 For joy awakes as dawning light
 When Christ's disciples lift their eyes
 Alive He stands, their friend and king
 Christ, Christ, He is risen
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
 Oh, sing hallelujah
 Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
 Where doubt and darkness once had been
 They saw Him and their hearts believed
 But blessed are those who have not seen
 Yet, sing hallelujah
 Once bound by fear now bold in faith
 They preached the truth and power of grace
 And pouring out their lives they gained
 Life, life everlasting
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
 Oh, sing hallelujah
 Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
 The power that raised Him from the grave
 Now works in us to powerfully save
 He frees our hearts to live His grace
 Go tell of His goodness
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
 Oh, sing hallelujah
 Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
 Oh, sing hallelujah
 Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
 He is risen, He's alive, He's alive!
 Heaven's gates are opened wide
 He's alive, He's alive!
 Now in heaven glorified
 He's alive, He's alive!
 Heaven's gates are opened wide
 He's alive, He's alive!
 Now in heaven glorified</lyrics>
