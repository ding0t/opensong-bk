 He left the splendour of Heaven,
 knowing His destiny
 was the lonely hill of Calvary
 where He laid down His life for me.

[C1]
   If that isn't love,
   the ocean is dry,
   there's no stars in the sky,
   and the sparrow can't fly.
   If that isn't love,
   then heaven's a myth,
   there's no feeling like this,
   if that isn't love.

[V2]
 Even in death He remembered
 the thief hanging by His side.
 He spoke with love and compassion,
 then He took Him to paradise.</lyrics>
