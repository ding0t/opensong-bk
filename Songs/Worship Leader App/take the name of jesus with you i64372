<lyrics>[V1]
 Take the name of Jesus with you,
 Child of sorrow and of woe;
 It will joy and comfort give you,
 Take it, then, where'er you go.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   Precious name, O how sweet!
   Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
   Precious name, O how sweet!
   Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

[V2]
 Take the name of Jesus with you,
 As a shield from every snare;
 If temptations round you gather,
 Breathe that holy name in prayer.

[V3]
 Oh the precious name of Jesus!
 How it thrills our souls with joy,
 When His loving arms receive us,
 And His songs our tongues employ.

[V4]
 At the name of Jesus bowing,
 Falling prostrate at His feet,
 King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
 When our journey is complete.</lyrics>
