 No one knew how alone I was feeling
 And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide
 Though I laughed and said my life was fine without You
 I was covering up the secret tears I cried
 Then one day someone told me of Your mercy
 And the love You showed on a hill called calvary
 there You died and purchased my redemtion
 When You broke sin's power and set my spirit free

[C1]
   Chorus:
   I'm amazed that You love me
   I'm amazed how You care
   Through Your precious blood, I've found pardon
   And my sins are washed, they're all washed away,
   all my sins are washed away.

[V2]
 Yes it's true there have been days I've failed You
 Lord You know the many times I've gone astray
 But I've learned that Your love is stronger than my weakness
 And Your ear is open every time I pray
 No one else has ever cared for me like You Lord
 Other friends could never be as close to me
 I'm not affraid to face the problems of tomorrow
 Knowing You are everything I'll ever need</lyrics>
