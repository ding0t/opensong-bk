<lyrics>[V1]
.      D
 Your Presence is all I need
.     A/C#        A
 It's all I want, all I seek
.     G         Bm                 A
 Without it, without it there's no meaning
.     D
 Your Presence is the air I breathe
.    A/C#              A     A/F#
 The song I sing, the love I need
.     G        Bm                  A
 Without it, without it I'm not living

[C1]
.          G            A           Bm    A/C#   D
   I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt   You, Lord
.  D/F#     G      Bm       A
   There is no one like You God
.           G        A              Bm     A/C#  D
   I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt    You, Lord
.  D/F#     G       Bm      A
   No other name be lifted high

[B1]
.                D       A
   There will be no one like You
.      Em   D/F#   G
   And no   one beside You
.       D         A             G
   You alone are worthy of all praise</lyrics>
