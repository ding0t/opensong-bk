.             C
 I sought the Lord
.       F        C
 And He answered me
.              G F
 And delivered me
.           C
 From every fear

[V2]
.                  C
 Those who look on Him
.    F    C
 Are radiant
.                  G     F
 They'll never be ashamed
.                  C
 They'll never be ashamed

[V3]
 This poor man cried
 And the Lord heard me
 And saved me from
 My enemies

[V4]
 The Son of God
 Surrounds His saints
 He will deliver them
 He will deliver them

[C1]
.       Am     F         C
   Magnify the Lord with me
.        Am       F      C/G  G
   Come exalt His name together
.       Am     F         C
   Glorify the Lord with me
.        Am       F       C/G G
   Come exalt His name forever

[V5]
 Taste and see
 That the Lord is good
 Oh blessed is he
 Who hides in Him

[V6]
 Oh fear the Lord
 Oh all you saints
 He'll give you everything
 He'll give you everything

[B1]
   (Bridge)
   Let us bless the Lord
   Every day and night
   Never ending praise
   May our incense rise
