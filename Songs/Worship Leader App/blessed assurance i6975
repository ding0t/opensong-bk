<lyrics>[V1]
. A         D       G        D
 Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine!
.         Bm   A       E7      A    A7
 O what a foretaste of glory divine!
.           D       G           D
 Heir of Salvation, purchase of God,
.            Em      A             D
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

[C1]
.  A          D      G           D
   This is my story, this is my song,
.              G       E            A   A7
   Praising my Saviour all the day long;
.             D      G           D
   This is my story, this is my song,
.              Em      A            D
   Praising my Saviour all the day long.

[V2]
. A         D        G          D
 Perfect submission, perfect delight!
.           Bm  A       E7           A    A7
 Visions of rapture now burst in my sight;
.           D       G           D
 Angels descending, bring from above
.          Em     A           D
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

[V3]
. A         D        G         D
 Perfect submission, all is at rest,
.        Bm  A     E7        A     A7
 I in my Savior am happy and blessed;
.             D        G        D
 Watching and waiting, looking above,
.                Em        A             D
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lyrics>
