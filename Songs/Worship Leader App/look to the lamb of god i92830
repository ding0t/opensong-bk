<lyrics>[V1]
 1- If you from sin are longing to be free,
 Look to the Lamb of God;
 He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
 Look to the Lamb of God.

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Look to the Lamb of God,
   Look to the Lamb of God,
   For He alone is able to save you
   Look to the Lamb of God.

[V2]
 2- When Satan tempts and doubts and fears assail,
 Look to the Lamb of God;
 You in His strength shall over all prevail,
 Look to the Lamb of God. (Chorus)

[V3]
 3- Are you aweary, does the way seem long?
 Look to the Lamb of God;
 His love will cheer and fill your heart with song,
 Look to the Lamb of God. (Chorus)

[V4]
 4- Fear not when shadows on your pathway fall,
 Look to the Lamb of God;
 In joy or sorrow Christ is all in all,
 Look to the Lamb of God. (Chorus)</lyrics>
