<title>Now I know You Love Me</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 From the beginning when I first needed You
 and in that moment when I turned my eyes to You
 and on that day when I felt so all alone
 I could feel Your eyes looking down on me

[C1]
   Now, I know You love me, I can see
   You saw so much more that I could be
   You waited all that time, patiently
   Now, I know You love me, when I would flee
   far from Your arms, reaching for me
   With Your Grace and with Your love
   Your forgiveness from above
   I am here

[V2]
 From far away I could feel Your presence near
 I knew You cared and Your voice I could hear
 and in the silence I could hear You calling me
 every day I felt Your love drawing me</lyrics>
