<lyrics>[V1]
.D        Am      G         D
 I know a place a wonderful place
.                      Am
 Where accused and condemned
.      G        D
 Find mercy and grace
.                         Am
 Where the wrongs we have done
.         G             D
 And the wrongs done to us
.                       Am
 Were nailed there with Him
.G            D
 There on the cross
.       C(2)            G(2)
 At the cross (at the cross)
.F(5)            D
 He died for our sin
.       C(2)           G(2)
 At the cross (at the cross)
.F(5)             D
 He gave us life again</lyrics>
