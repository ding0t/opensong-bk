<aka>We Will Understand It By And By, Yesu azali awa</aka>
<lyrics>[V1]
 We are often tossed and driv'n on the restless sea of time.
 Somber skies and howling tempests oft succeed a bright sunshine.
 In that land of perfect day, when the mists have rolled away,
 We will understand it better by and by.

[C1]
   By and by, when the morning comes,
   All the saints of God are gathering home.
   We will tell the story how we've overcome
   We will understand it better by and by.

[V2]
 Trials dark on ev'ry hand, and we cannot understand
 All the way that God will lead us to that blessed promised land;
 But He'll guide us with His eye, and we'll follow till we die,
 We will understand it better by and by.

[V3]
 We are often destitute of the things that life demands.
 Want of shelter and of food, thirsty hill and barren land;
 But we're trusting in the Lord, and according to His word,
 We will understand it better by and by.

[V4]
 Temptations, hidden snares, often take us unawares,
 And our hearts are made to bleed, for each thoughtless word or deed;
 And we wonder why the test, when we try to do our best,
 But we'll understand it better by and by.

[V5]
 Yesu azali awa
 Yesu azali awa
 Yesu azali awa na biso

[C2]
   Alleluia, alleluia
   Alleluia na Yesu
   Alleluia, alleluia
   Alleluia na Yesu

[V6]
 Biso toko komo kuna
 Biso toko komo kuna
 Biso toko komo kuna na lola
 Biso toko komo kuna
 Biso toko komo kuna
 Biso toko komo kuna na lola</lyrics>
