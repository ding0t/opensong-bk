<lyrics>[V1]
 If My people
 which are called by My name
 Shall humble themselves
 shall humble themselves and pray

[V2]
 If My people
 which are called by My name
 Shall seek My face
 and turn from their wicked ways

[C1]
   Then will I hear from heaven
   Then will I hear from heaven
   Then will I hear
   and will forgive
   forgive their sin

[B1]
   I will forgive their sin
   I will forgive their sin
   I will forgive their sin
   And heal their land</lyrics>
