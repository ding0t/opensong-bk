<lyrics>[V1]
 My God my Father, while I stray
 Far from my home, on life's rough way,
 O teach me from my heart to say,
 &quot;Thy will be done!&quot;

[V2]
 Tho' dark my path, and sad my lot,
 Let me be still and murmur not,
 Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
 &quot;Thy will be done!&quot;

[V3]
 Let but my fainting heart be blest
 With Thy sweet Spirit for its Guest,
 My God, to Thee I leave the rest;
 &quot;Thy will be done!&quot;

[V4]
 Renew my will from day to day;
 Blend it with Thine, and take away
 All that now makes it hard to say,
 &quot;Thy will be done!&quot;</lyrics>
