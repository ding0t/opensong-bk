<lyrics>[C1]
.      D
   The lord thy God
.              Bm
   He's in the midst of thee
.       G          A
   He's mighty! So mighty!

[V1]
.    Bm                  F#m
 And I saw him. High and lifted up
.     G                     C9
 With power and grace and authority.
.    D                     Bm
 And he shall reign in the midst of thee.
.   G        A   D
 Forever and ever amen

[B1]
   Oh yes! He'll wipe every tear from our eyes, oh yes!
   We'll gather 'round his throne forever, yes!
   He reigns in the midst of his people.</lyrics>
