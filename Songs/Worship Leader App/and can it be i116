<title>And Can It Be?</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.G               Am/C D      G
 And can be that I    should gain,
.   C D      G     D A      D
 an interest in my Savior's blood?
.D           G/D     G/B        D
 Died He for me, who caused His pain?
.    C       G      D        G
 For me, who Him to death pursued?
.G       G/D       C   A  D
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     G       C           D       G
 That thou my Lord should die for me?

[C1]
.   G      D         C      G
   Amazing love, how can it be
.       C       G   Am     C   D   G
   That thou my God should die for me?

[V2]
.G                  Am/C D   G
 Long my imprisoned spi__rit lay,
.     C     D  G       D A      D
 Fast bound in sin and nature's night,
.D            G/D     G/B        D
 Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
.  C         G       D           G
 I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
.G              G/D     C     A   D
 My chains fell off, my heart was free,
.  G          C         D        G
 I rose, went forth and followed thee.

[V3]
.G               Am/C D G
 No condemnation now  I dread,
.  C    D   G      D    A  D
 Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
.D        G/D     G/B    D
 Alive in Him, my living Head
.    C            G        D      G
 and clothed with righteousness divine,
.G        G/D         C  A   D
 Bold I approach the eternal throne,
.    G         C             D          G
 And claim the crown through Christ, my own.</lyrics>
