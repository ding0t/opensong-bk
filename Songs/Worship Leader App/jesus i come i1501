<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh how I need Your grace
 More than my words can say
 Jesus I come, Jesus I come
 In all my weaknesses
 You are my confidence
 Jesus I come, Jesus I come

[C1]
   I will rise, stand redeemed
   Heaven open over me
   To Your name eternally
   Endless glory I will bring (oh)

[V2]
 Oh what amazing love
 We need Your cleansing flood
 Jesus I come, Jesus I come
 In every broken place
 You are my righteousness
 Jesus I come, Jesus I come

[C2]
   I will rise, stand redeemed
   Heaven open over me
   To Your name eternally
   Endless glory I will bring (oh)

[B1]
   Thank You Jesus
   Just as I am I come
   Hallelujah
   Oh what amazing love
   Oh what amazing love
   I will rise, stand redeemed
   Heaven open over me
   To Your name eternally
   Endless glory I will bring
   I will rise, stand redeemed
   Heaven open over me
   To Your name eternally
   Endless glory I will bring (oh, oh)</lyrics>
