<lyrics>[V1]
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 my desire.
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 to be close to You.
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 my desire.
 I want to follow you, Lord. (2x)

[V2]
 Show me your ways, Lord.
 I want to walk them with you.
 Come, teach me more and
 more; I want to follow you, Lord.

[V3]
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 my desire.
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 to be close to You.
 You satisfy the longing in me,
 my desire.
 I want to follow You, Lord. (2x)

[V4]
 Let me see with Your eyes,
 the wonders of Your hand.
 Open my heart to You more and
 more; I want to see You, Lord.</lyrics>
