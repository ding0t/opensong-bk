 1- Each cooing dove and sighing bough,
 That makes the eve so blest to me,
 Has something far diviner now,
 It bears me back to Galilee.

[C1]
   O Galilee! sweet Galilee!
   Where Jesus loved so much to be;
   O Galilee! blue Galilee!
   Come, sing thy song again to me!

[V2]
 2- Each flow'ry glen and mossy dell,
 Where happy birds in song agree,
 Thro' sunny morn the praises tell
 Of sights and sounds in Galilee. [Chorus]

[V3]
 3- And when I read the thrilling love
 Of Him who walked upon the sea,
 I long, oh, how I long once more
 To follow Him in Galilee. [Chorus]</lyrics>
