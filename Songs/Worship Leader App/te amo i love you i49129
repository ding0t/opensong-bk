   Te Amo, I love You
   Con todo mi corazon(2x)
   With all my heart, Oh Senor
   With all my soul, Oh Senor
   I Love You Lord
   Te Amo, Te Amo
   I love You Lord, I love You Lord(2x)

[V1]
 I love the way, You never change
 Your Word remains for ever and ever
 I love Your Name, Jesus the same
 Yesterday today, for ever and ever
 Oh Lord your love never fails me
 Oh Lord you love never fails

[V2]
 I love Your Grace, that broke the chains
 Of sin and shame, for ever and ever
 I love Your Mercy, Lord You are Worthy
 Of all the Glory, for ever and ever
 Oohh oh oh Your Love never fails me
 No Your Love never fails me</lyrics>
