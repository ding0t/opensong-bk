.C                  Dm     C             Dm
 What a friend I've found, closer than a brother;
.C                Dm          C             Dm
 I have felt Your touch, more intimate than lovers.

.C                Dm          C               Dm
 What a hope I've found, more faithful than a mother;
.C                 Dm       C              Dm
 It would break my heart to ever lose each other.</lyrics>
