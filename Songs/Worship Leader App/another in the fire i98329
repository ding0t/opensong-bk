.Am                       F6             C
 There's a grace when the heart is under fire,
.Am                   F6                  C
 Another way when the walls are closing in,
.Am                     F6
 And when I look at the space between
.        C                   G/C
 Where I used to be and this reckoning,
.Am            F6            C
 I know I will never be alone

[C1]
.                           Am
   There was another in the fire
.  F6                 C
   Standing next to me,
.                           Am
   There was another in the waters
.  F6                C
   Holding back the seas
.                         Am
   And should I ever need reminding
.     F                    C
   Of how I've been set free
.                                   Am
   There is a cross that bears the burden
.          F6               C
   Where another died for me,
.                          Am  F6 C
   There is another in the fire

[V2]
.Am                   F6                 C
 All my debt left for dead beneath the waters,
.Am              F6                 C
 I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore,
.Am                       F6
 And should I fall in the space between
.       C                    Em7
 What remains of me, and this reckoning,
.Am                 F6
 Either way, I won't bow
.                      C
 To the things of this world,
.Am                F6        C
 And I know I will never be alone

[C2]
.                          Am
   There is another in the fire
.  F6               C
   Standing next to me,
.                          Am
   There is another in the waters
.  F6               C
   Holding back the seas,
.                           Am
   And should I ever need reminding,
.       F             C
   What power set me free,
.                                 Am
   There is a grave that holds no body,
.               F6            C
   And that power lives in me,
.                           Am F6 C
   There is another in the fire oh oh
.                           Am F6 C
   There is another in the fire oh,oh x2

[B1]
.                    Am            F
   And I can see the light, in the darkness
.           C              G
   As the darkness bows to Him,
.                 Am             F
   I can hear the roar, in the heavens
.         C/E                 G
   As the space between wears thin
.                 Am             F
   I can feel the ground, shake beneath us
.         C/E               G
   As the prison walls cave in,
.                   Dm
   Nothing stands be-tween us
.                   F       G
   Nothing stands be-tween u-s

[V3]
.Am                F6
 There is no other name,
.                     C
 But the Name, that is Jesus,
.Am                   F6
 He who was and still is
.                       C
 And will be through it all,
.Am                      F6
 So come what may in the space between,
.        C                      G/C
 All the things unseen, and this reckoning,
.Am            F6            C
 I know I will never be alone,
.Am            F6            C
 I know I will never be alone

[C3]
.                             Am
   There'll be another in the fire,
.  F6               C
   Standing next to me
.                             Am
   There'll be another in the waters,
.  F6               C
   Holding back the seas
.                           Am
   And should I ever need reminding
.      F                   C
   How good You've been to me
.                                Am
   I'll count the joy come every battle
.           F6                         C
   'Cause I know that's where You'll be</lyrics>
