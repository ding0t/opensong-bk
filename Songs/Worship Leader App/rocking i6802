 Little Jesus, sweetly sleep,
 Do not stir,
 We will lend a coat of fur.
 We will rock you, rock you, rock you,
 We will rock you, rock you, rock you,
 We will love you all we can,
 Darling, darling little man.

[V2]
 Mary's little baby sleep,
 Sweetly sleep,
 Sleep in comfort, slumber deep.
 We will rock you, rock you, rock you,
 We will rock, you, rock you, rock you
 We will serve you all we can,
 Darling, darling little man.</lyrics>
