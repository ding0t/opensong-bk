 Without love
 There's no need to prophesy
 Without love
 There would be no blue skies
 Without love
 We're all just wasting our time
 Love's the key to eternal life

[V2]
 Love suffers long and it's kind to all
 (All the time)
 It never fails, helping others
 (Never seeks her own)
 Love always bears and endureth all
 Without love everything would fall

[V3]
 Love is the greatest gift that
 (God has given us)
 It never leaves
 Love is stronger
 (Than anything)

[V4]
 I can have faith to remove mountains
 But it means nothin' without love

[V5]
 Love is the greatest
 God has given us
 It never leaves
 Than anything
 I can have faith
 To remove mountains

[V6]
 Love is the key
 (It's the greatest gift)
 Love is the key
 (It forgives all things)

[V7]
 Love is the key
 (It's the greatest gift of all)
 Love is the key
 We need love, we need love
 We need love, love is the key</lyrics>
