 Over this moment
 In every season
 This is Your promise
 Jesus You reign
 Jesus You reign
 Over this city
 Over our families
 Under Your covering
 Jesus You reign
 Jesus You reign

[C1]
   Our God reigns
   Our God reigns
   Hallelujah Hallelujah
   Our God Reigns

[V2]
 Over the nations
 With all creation
 You own the heavens
 Jesus You reign
 Jesus You reign
 You own the victory
 Over the enemy
 With all authority
 Jesus You reign
 Jesus You reign

[B1]
   Sickness will bow
   Idols fall down
   It's happening now
   At the name of Jesus
   Darkness will run
   Hell's overcome
   It's already done
   At the name of Jesus</lyrics>
