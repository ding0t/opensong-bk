<lyrics>[V1]
 1- While passing thro' this world of sin,
 and others your life shall view,
 Be clean and pure without, within;
 Let others see Jesus in you.

[C1]
   Let others see Jesus in you,
   Let others see Jesus in you.
   Keep telling the story, be faithful and true;
   Let others see Jesus in you.

[V2]
 2. Your life's a book before their eyes,
 They're reading it thro' and thro'
 Say, does it point them to the skis,
 Do others see Jesus in you?

[V3]
 3. Then live for Christ both day and night,
 Be faithful, be brave and true,
 and lead the lost to life and Christ.
 Let others see Jesus in you.</lyrics>
