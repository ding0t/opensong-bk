.C
 I saw the Lord
. Am
 Seated on His throne
 He was clothed in glory
.   F       G
 Exalted high
.                     C
 And the train of His robe
 Fills the temple
.             F           Gsus
 And the angels circle 'round Him
.     F   G
 And they cry
.C
 You are Holy
.Am
 Oh so Holy
.F   Dm           Gsus
 You are Holy Lord of all</lyrics>
