<lyrics>[V1]
.G
 Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude
.     G              D/F#       Em7
 Of those from every tribe and tongue
.D            C                       Am7
 We are Your people redeemed by Your blood
.               D
 Rescued from death by Your love
.               G
 There are no words
.                 G
 Good enough to thank You
.              G         D/F#       Em7
 There are no words to express my praise
.            C
 But I will lift up my voice
.    G/B            Em7
 And sing from my heart
.     F              D
 With all of my strength

[C1]
.  G               G/B        C
   Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
.          D
   To the Lamb
.  G               G/B
   Hallelujah hallelujah
.           C                  D
   By the blood of Christ we stand
.         G            G/B
   Every tongue every tribe
.         C             D
   Every people every land
.          G           G/B
   Giving glory giving honor
.           C              D       G
   Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

[V2]
 Lord we stand by grace in Your presence
 Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
 We are Your children called by Your name
 Humbly we bow and we pray
 Release Your power
 To work in us and through us
 Till we are changed
 To be more like You
 Then all the nations will see
 Your glory revealed
 And worship You</lyrics>
