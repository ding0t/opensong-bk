<lyrics>[V1]
 Teach me your ways
 Oh Lord, my God
 And I will walk in your truth
 Give me a totally undivided heart
 That I may fear your name

[V2]
 Purify my heart
 Cleanse me Lord, I pray
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Purify my heart
 Cleanse me Lord, I pray
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Of your love

[V3]
 Teach me your ways
 Oh Lord, my God
 And I will walk in your truth
 Give me a totally undivided heart
 That I may fear your name

[V4]
 Purify my heart (purify my heart)
 Cleanse me Lord, I pray
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Purify my heart (purify my heart)
 Cleanse me Lord, I pray
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Of your love

[V5]
 Ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[V6]
 Purify my heart (purify my heart)
 Cleanse me Lord, I pray
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Purify my heart (purify my heart)
 Cleanse me, Lord, I pray (I pray)
 Remove from me all that is standing in the way
 Of your love</lyrics>
