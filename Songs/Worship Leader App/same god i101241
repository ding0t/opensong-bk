 I won't be discouraged
 Even when I'm discouraged
 I'll remind my soul
 Of all You've done before
 I won't be distracted
 Even in the distraction
 I will trust the one
 Who is greater than the storm

[P1]
   Said I will trust the one
   Who is greater than the storm

[V2]
 I don't need another reason
 I don't more convincing
 The same God who made a way
 Is the same God who's here today
 Even in my darkest moment
 This will be the truth I'm holding
 The same God who made a way
 Is the same God who's here today

[V3]
 I won't be shaken
 Even when I'm shaking
 Having done all I can do
 I still will stand
 And I will worship
 Yes I will worship
 I will face whatever comes
 With lifted hands

[V4]
 If You're not done moving
 Then I'm not done waiting
 If You're not done working
 Then I'm not done praising

[B1]
   I believe You're moving
   So I'm not done waiting
   I believe You're working
   So I'm not done praising</lyrics>
