<lyrics>[V1]
 I pray into the atmosphere
 Spirit of God, You're here
 You have all authority

[V2]
 I pray over my heart and mind
 I am healed by Your stripes
 Your blood declares that I am free

[V3]
 In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray
 Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim
 Every weapon formed against me, it must break
 In the mighty name of Jesus

[V4]
 I draw a permanent boundary line
 The enemy has no rights
 To come near my family

[V5]
 No scheme could ever undo God's plans
 No matter the circumstance
 The cross has sealed my destiny

[V6]
 Oh, in the mighty name of Jesus, I pray
 Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim
 That every weapon formed against me must break
 In the mighty name of Jesus

[V7]
 In the mighty name of Jesus, oh, I know
 That all the power of fear and darkness must go
 Every key to every victory, I hold
 In the mighty name of Jesus

[V8]
 I will not fear, I will not fear
 When the enemy comes near
 On the door frame of my life
 Is the blood of Jesus Christ

[V9]
 Oh, I will not fear, I will not fear
 There's an army of angels here
 I'm protected on all sides
 By the blood of Jesus Christ</lyrics>
