<lyrics>[V1]
 I Have Lost My Reputation Since I Turned My
 Back On Sin,
 And A Lot Of Friends Went From Me Since I
 Let My Saviour In;
 Now They Pass Me By Unknown, When They
 Once Passed With A Smile;
 Now They Say I'm Very Foolish, And They Say
 I'm Out Of Style.

[C1]
   I Am Marked, Marked, Marked,
   I Am Marked, Now Wherever I Go;
   I Am Marked, Marked, Marked,
   Just What I Am Everyone Seems To Know.
   I Am Sealed, Sealed, Sealed,
   I Am Sealed By His Spirit Divine;
   O Glory To God! Hallelujah! Amen!
   I Am His And I Know That He Is Mine.

[V2]
 Well, They Say My Life Is Ruined, And My
 Talent Thrown Away,
 And They Cannot Understand It, For I Had
 Such Plans One Day;
 But I Know What I Surrendered When I
 Promised I'd Go Through;
 And I Gained Far More Glory Since God
 Made Me Over New.</lyrics>
