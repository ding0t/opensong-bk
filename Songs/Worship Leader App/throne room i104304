 Jesus is in this room
 Here right now, here right now
 Making this place I stand
 Holy ground, holy ground
 Your Spirit moves and breathes
 All around, all around
 All good and perfect things
 Flowing down, flowing down

[P1]
   If all of the heavens are singing along
   With the saints and the elders in glorious song
   And the praises they sing never seem to get old
   Then I'll stay here, forever singing

[C1]
   Holy, holy, holy Lord
   God Almighty, over all
   Cause You were, You are
   And You'll be forever
   The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
   Holy, holy Lord,

[V2]
 Gentle love calling m–µ
 Closer still, closer still
 Jesus, You're guiding me
 To Your will, to Your will

[B1]
   The veil is torn and the doors fling wide
   I see glory as I run inside
   The throne room, yeah, and before You
   I bow, I bow</lyrics>
