<lyrics>[V1]
 I rest in God alone,
 from whom comes my salvation;
 my soul finds rest in God,
 my fortress: I'll not be shaken.

[C1]
   My hope is in the Lord,
   my honour and strength;
   my refuge is the Lord forever,
   my trust and all of my heart
   in God alone my soul finds rest.

[V2]
 I rest in God alone,
 from whom comes my salvation;
 my soul finds rest in God,
 my fortress: I'll not be shaken.

[C2]
   Oh trust in God, you people;
   pour out your hearts,
   for God is our refuge forever,
   my trust and all of my heart
   in God alone my soul finds rest.</lyrics>
