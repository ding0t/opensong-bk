<lyrics>[V1]
 You make Your face to shine on me
 Now my soul knows very well
 You lift me up an' I'm cleansed and free
 Now my soul knows very well

[C1]
   When mountains fall, I'll stand
   By the power of Your hand
   And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell
   That my soul knows very well

[V2]
 Joy and strength each day I find
 That my soul knows very well
 Forgiveness, forgiveness, hope, I know is mine
 That my soul knows very well

[C2]
   When mountains fall, I'll stand
   By the power of Your hand
   And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell
   That my soul knows very well</lyrics>
