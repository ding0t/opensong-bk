<lyrics>[V1]
.                B                         F#              C# D#m
 I knew I was broken but there was no one that I could tell, mmmmm
.                 B                           F#         C#  D#m
 Praying felt like I was throwing pennies in a wishing well__
.    B             F#           C#                   D#m
 And I started believing I was cursed to carry this weight
.B                   F#           B               C#
 I was listing the reasons of why I should walk away

[C1]
.         B      F#            C#     D#m
   Until gra-a-a-ace called my na-a-a-ame
.      B                         F#         C#        D#m
   Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me
.         B      F#              C#      D#m
   Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains
.      B                         F#
   Oh, I didn't know I could be free
.      
       C# N.C.
   Until grace found, Your grace found me

[V2]
.N.C.          B                           F#           C#  D#m
  I might be looking at a future full of question marks, m__mmmm
.                B                              F#       C# D#m
 But I don't to have all of the answers if You have my heart
.    B                 F#                C#              D#m
 In You I'm finding redemption a little more with every breath
.  B                 F#               C#
 Brand new like the morning and I'll never forget that...

[V3]
 CHORUS:
.       B      F#            C#     D#m
 Until gra-a-a-ace called my na-a-a-ame
.    B                         F#         C#        D#m
 Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me
.       B      F#              C#      D#m
 Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains
.    B                         F#
 Oh, I didn't know I could be free
.        C#                F#   F#   B F# C# F#
 Until grace found, Your grace found me
.    
     (Your grace found meee-ee-eee-eeeeeeeeee)

[V4]
.    
     Ohhh ohhhhh ohhhhhhhhh
 BREAK:
. B             D#m              C#
 You came like force of nature, knocked down every wall I made
. B             D#m                       C#
 You rescued my soul when I thought there was no escape, no

[V5]
. B             D#m              C#
 You came like force of nature, knocked down every wall I made
. B             D#m                       C#
 You rescued my soul when I thought there was no escape,

[V6]
 CHORUS:
.       F#          B           F#

.    
     (Uh, tell it to Him)
.        B            F#            C#     D#m
 Until grace, until grace called my na-a-a-ame
.    B                         F#         C#        D#m
 Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me
.       B      F#              C#      D#m
 Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains (Broke these chains)
.B                         F#
 I didn't know I could be free
.        C#                          B        F#            C#       D#m
