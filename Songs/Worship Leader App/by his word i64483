<lyrics>[V1]
 It is written that man
 shall not live by bread alone
 But by every word that comes
 from the mouth of God
 And by his word he gave His son
 for us on Calvary
 To pay the price of sin for you and for me

[V2]
 By His word
 He raised the sick man from the bed
 By His word
 He gave life unto the dead By His word
 He brings hope to the hopeless soul
 By His word
 You can have the victory
 By His word
 He will set the captive free By His word
 He brings life to you and me

[V3]
 Just one word was broken in Eden
 And that's what caused the fall
 So it will take all of the word
 To bring us back to God
 And through this last day message
 All His word has been made known
 And through His power we shall overcome

[V4]
 By His word
 He spoke and squirrels did appear
 By His word
 Storm go back from where you came
 By His word
 Little fishie Jesus gives you back your life
 By His word
 He spoke the tumor out of existence
 By His word
 He gave two boys salvation By His word
 He gave life to you and me</lyrics>
