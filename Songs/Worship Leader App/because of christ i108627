 On a hill in Israel Mercy spoke for me
 Mercy spoke for me Mercy spoke for me
 It was on Golgotha's tree His death brought liberty
 His death brought liberty His death brought liberty

[C1]
   May I never boast in anything
   Except the cross of Jesus Christ
   May I not forget the blood
   He shed It is by His death
   I am alive Because of Christ, I am alive

[V2]
 What a humble sacrifice
 Love that washed me clean
 Love that washed me clean
 Love that washed me clean

[B1]
   What a blessed mystery
   His punishment, my peace
   His punishment, my peace
   His punishment, my peace

[C2]
   // Because of Christ,
   I am alive //

[B2]
   //// Hallelujah Hallelujah
   Praise the one who set me free
   Death has lost its grip on me
   Hallelujah Hallelujah
   Jesus rose in victory
   He's alive, alive in me ////

[C3]
   Because of Christ, I am alive
   Because of Christ, I am alive
   Because of Christ, I am alive</lyrics>
