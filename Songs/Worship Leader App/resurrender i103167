 You're turning over tables
 And calling for return
 To our lives upon the altar
 The things we did at first
 You're clearing out the temple
 You're cleaning out the dirt
 For we are Your territory
 Lord we are Your Church

[C1]
   We are Your people
   You are our God
   We are Your temple
   Make us holy like You are

[V2]
 You see a holy nation
 A flock to consecrate
 A chosen generation
 A people called to pray
 So help us God to please You
 Where only You can see
 For every moment matters in eternity

[C2]
   We are Your people
   You are our God
   We are Your temple
   Make us holy like You are
   We are Your children
   You've set us apart
   God for Your glory
   Make us holy like You are

[B1]
   Mark Your people with Your presence
   Make us a place where You delight to dwell
   May we heed Your hand's correction
   Oh Lord our Shepherd
   You do all things well
   Your love as firm as it is tender
   Your law is perfect
   And Your judgments true
   As we run to resurrender
   You will restore what we return to You
   You are restoring as we yield anew

[B2]
   If You're calling
   We're coming
   We're not walking
   We're running
   God we need resurrender
   We resurrender</lyrics>
