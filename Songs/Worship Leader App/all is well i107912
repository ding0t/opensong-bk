 All is well all is well
 Angels and men rejoice
 For tonight darkness fell
 Into the dawn of love's light
 Sing Ale

 All is well all is well
 Let there be peace on earth
 Christ's come go and tell
 That He is in the manger
 Sing Ale
 Sing Alleluia

 Lift up your voices and sing
 Born is now Emmanuel
 Born is our Lord and Savior
 Sing Alleluia
 Sing Alleluia

 Born is now Emmanuel
 Born is our Lord and Savior
