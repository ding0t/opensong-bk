<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord I want to take the time
 Just to praise your holy name
 Because you´ve been
 Been so good to me
 So from the rising of the sun
 Until the going down of the same
 Lord your name alone
 Is worthy to be praised

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Jehovah Nissi, the Lord our banner
   Jehovah Rapha, the Lord our healer
   Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our peace
   Jehovah Shammah, the Lord is present
   Jehovah Raah, the Lord our shepherd
   Jehovah Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness
   Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our Peace
   Jehovah Jireh, he provideth all our needs

[V2]
 You are the great I Am, that I Am
 The God that was, is and is to come
 Prophet, Priest and King
 Eagle, Lamb and Lion
 Son of Man, Son of God and Son of David

[V3]
 You are the Rose of Sharon
 You´re the Lily of the valley
 You´re the bright and morning star
 That´s who you are
 The mighty Conqueror
 That´s been unconquered by tradition
 The Lord God Jehovah is His name</lyrics>
