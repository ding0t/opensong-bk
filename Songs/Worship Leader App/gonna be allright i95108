<title>Gonna be Allright</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I've found my meaning in You
 Your cause is the reason why I live
 Your grace is teaching me how to give

[V2]
 I give my whole life to You
 Your love is the reason why I song
 Jesus You are my everything

[V3]
 Every night, everyday
 I don't need to worry, no I celebrate
 All the things You've done in me

[V4]
 And its gonna be alright, cause
 You are in my life
 Yes its gonna be alright

[V5]
 Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be alright
 And its gonna be alright,
 'Cause Jesus, you're my light
 And You have shown me the way
 All of my troubles, all of my life
 I give to You, my king</lyrics>
