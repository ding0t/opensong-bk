<title>Lord I lift your Name</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, my heart can grow, so far away and cold;
 And yet for me Your love is still the same
 Lord, I bend my knee in awe and fear of Thee
 My head bowed down in rev'rence to Your name.

[C1]
   I lift Your name, Your Holy name,
   Jehovah God, Elohim
   The Great I Am, the Risen Lamb
   My Comforter and King.

[V2]
 Lord, my heart's desire is
 to be filled with the Spirit Fire,
 My purpose is to worship You alone.
 Open up my soul to worship and adore,
 To be a fragrane offered to Your throne.</lyrics>
