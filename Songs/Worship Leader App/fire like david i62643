<lyrics>[V1]
 There is a fire that burns in me
 In flames with power moving in me
 it burns stronger, Oh Holy fire!
 I can feel it blazing here

[C1]
   Fire!
   Fire of the Lord!
   Fire, Fire, Fire purifying me!

[V2]
 When ADONAI restores our lives from captivity
 We'll be like those who are dreaming
 Our mouths will be full of laughter
 Our lips will be full of praises
 We'll say among the nations:
 &quot;Great things The Lord has done&quot;

[P1]
   I will Rejoice, and Rejoice
   And Rejoice in ADONAI
   He has carried all my pain
   He set me free!!!

[C2]
   I'll sing like King David sang
   I'll dance like King David danced
   I'll be like King David was
   into His presence!

[B1]
   Sing to the Lord!
   Dance to the Lord!
   His Holy presence abounds in joy !
   Give to the Lord:
   Glory and love
   We shall bow down unto His Throne</lyrics>
