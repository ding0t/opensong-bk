 Verse 1
 I won't forget
 The wonder of how You brought
 Deliverance
 The exodus of my heart

[V2]
 Pre Chorus
 You found me
 You freed me
 Held back the waters for my release
 Oh Yahweh

[V3]
 Chorus
 You're the God who fights for me
 Lord of every victory
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
 You have torn apart the sea
 You have led me through the deep
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

[V4]
 Verse 2
 A cloud by day
 A sign that You are with me
 The fire by night
 A guiding light to my feet

[V5]
 Bridge
 You stepped into my Egypt
 You took me by the hand
 You marched me out in freedom
 Into the promised land
 Now I will not forget You
 I'll sing of all You've done
 Death is swallowed up forever
 By the fury of Your love</lyrics>
