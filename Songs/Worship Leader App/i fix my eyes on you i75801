.  E                                      B
 I fix my eyes on you, the author of my faith
. A                               B      E
 Casting aside every sin and every weight
.  E                                  B
 I fix my eyes on you, I lay my burdens down
.A                                         B  E
 Letting the cares of this world now fade away

[V2]
.A               B                E
 One thing I ask, this one thing I seek
.       A                                  B   E
 That I may dwell in your house oh Lord my King
.A                      B
 All the days of my life
.                  E            B
 I want to gaze upon your beauty
.        A                      B E
 And seek you in this Holy place</lyrics>
