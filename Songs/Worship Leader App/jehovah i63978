<lyrics>[V1]
 Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
 You are more than enough for me
 Jehovah Rapha, You are my Healer
 By Your stripes, I am set free
 Jehovah Shammah, You are with me
 You supply all my needs
 You are more than enough
 You are more than enough
 You are more than enough for me

[V2]
 Jehovah Nissi, You are my Victory
 You are more than enough for me
 Jehovah Tsidkenu, my Righteousness
 All You are, I now can be
 Jehovah Raah, You're my Shepherd
 Shalom, You are my Peace
 You are more than enough
 You are more than enough
 You are more than enough for me</lyrics>
