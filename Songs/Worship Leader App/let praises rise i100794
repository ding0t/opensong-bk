.Em             C
 Let praises rise from the inside
.          G         D
 From the inside of me
.          Em            C
 May You delight in the inside
.       G          D
 In the inside of me
.              Em             C
 Come fill my life from the inside
.           G         D
 From the inside of me
.            Em             C
 Set me on fire from the inside
.           G         D
 From the inside of me
