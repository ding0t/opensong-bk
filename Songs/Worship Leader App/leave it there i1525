 If the world from you withholds of its silver and its gold
 And you have to get along with meager fare
 Just remember, in his word, how he feeds the little bird
 Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

[V2]
 Chorus:
 Leave it there, leave it there
 Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there
 If you trust him through your doubt, he will surely bring you out
 Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

[V3]
 If your body suffers pain
 And your health you can't regain,
 And your soul is
 Almost sinking in despair,
 Jesus knows the pain you feel,
 He can save and He can heal;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.

[V4]
 Leave it there, leave it there,
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there;
 If you trust and never doubt,
 He will surely bring you out;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.

[V5]
 When your enemies assail
 And your heart begins to fail,
 Don't forget that God
 In heaven answers prayer;
 He will make a way for you
 And will lead you safely through;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.

[V6]
 Leave it there, leave it there,
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there;
 If you trust and never doubt,
 He will surely bring you out;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.

[V7]
 When your youthful days are gone
 And old age is stealing on,
 And your body bends
 Beneath the weight of care;
 He will never leave you then,
 He'll go with you to the end;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.

[V8]
 Leave it there, leave it there,
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there;
 If you trust and never doubt,
 He will surely bring you out;
 Take your burden to the Lord
 And leave it there.</lyrics>
