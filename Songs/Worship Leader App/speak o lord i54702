.D       E  A2         D        A
 &quot;Speak, O Lord, as we come to You

 To receive the food of Your Holy Word.

 Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;

 Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
.A        E        A               D       A
 That the light of Christ might be seen today

 In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.

 All Your purposes for Your glory.

[V2]
.D     E    A2          D   A
 Teach us, Lord, full obedience,

 Holy reverence, true humility;
.D     E   A2               D  A

 Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see

 Your majestic love and authority.

 Words of pow'r that can never fail-

 Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

[V3]
.D      E  A2         D        A
 Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
.         D        A               F#m       E
 Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us-

 Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
.          D    A             E    A
 That will echo down through eternity.
.A        E         A             D     A
 And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
.       E           A           F#m       E
 And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
.D      E  A2               D        A
 Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
.        D         A               E4   A
 And the earth is filled with Your glory.&quot;</lyrics>
