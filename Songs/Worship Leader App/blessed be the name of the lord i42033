.  G/A             D      G         D
   The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
.                    A                    D     G/A
   The righteous run into it and they are saved.
.  G/A             D      G         D
   The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
.                    A                    D
   The righteous run into it and they are saved.</lyrics>
