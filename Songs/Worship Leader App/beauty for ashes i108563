.   C7      F
 He gave me beauty for ashes
.    Gm7            C7
 The oil of joy for mourning

 The garment of praise
.        F      Bb F  C7 F
 For the spirit of heaviness
.     C7     F
 That we might be trees of righteousness
.    Gm7             C7
 The planting of the Lord
.               F        Bb  F
 That He might be glorified__</lyrics>
