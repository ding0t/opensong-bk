<lyrics>[V1]
 When He moves among us all that He does
 All of His mercy, all of His love
 If the pen of a writer could write everyday
 Even this world could never contain
 How I've been blessed
 Warmth in the winter, flowers in the spring
 Laughter at summer, the changing of leaves
 Food on my table and a good place to sleep
 Clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
 I have been blessed

[C1]
   I have been blessed, God's so good to me
   Precious are His thoughts of you and me
   No way I could count them, there's not enough time
   So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
   God has been good, so good
   I have been blessed

[V2]
 Arms that will raise, a voice that can talk
 Hands that can touch, legs that can walk
 Ears that can listen, eyes that can see
 I've got to praise Him as long as I breathe
 I have been blessed
 A mother and father who nurtured and raised
 Sisters and brother, memories made
 Our pastor to lead us this altar to pray
 Stripes that can heal the blood that still saves
 I have been blessed

[C2]
   I have been blessed, God's so good to me
   Precious are His thoughts of you and me
   No way I could count them, there's not enough time
   So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
   God has been good, so good
   I have been blessed

[V3]
 He's my shoulder to lean on when I am down
 The rock where He leads me when I'm overwhelmed
 The place where He hides me under His wings
 He's not just a song, He's the reason I sing
 I have been blessed

[C3]
   I have been blessed, God's so good to me
   Precious are His thoughts of you and me
   No way I could count them, there's not enough time
   So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
   God has been good, so good
   I have been blessed</lyrics>
