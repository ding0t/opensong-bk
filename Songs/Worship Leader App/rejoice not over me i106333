.   Em                     Am
 Rejoice not over me, O my enemy
.        F             C            G     D/F#
 When I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness
.    Em                      Am
 The LORD will be a light, a light to me
.         C       D          Em
 For the LORD, my God, my salvation!

[C1]
.           G             Em
   In these all things we are
.            Am7                     C
   More than conquerors through our LORD!
.           G             Em
   In these all things we are
.            Am7                    C   Dsus4
   More than conquerors through our LORD
.         Em
   Christ Jesus!

[B1]
.            C                D
   And we'll overcome by the blood of the Lamb
.             Em7          Am7
   And by the word of our testimony
.            C                      D
   We will stay trustworthy to our LORD Jesus Christ
.      Em      D      C2
   Who was and is and is to come!</lyrics>
