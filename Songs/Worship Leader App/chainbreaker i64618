<lyrics>[V1]
.               C
 If you've been walking the same old road for miles
 and miles
.                 Am
 If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the
 same old lies
.            G
 If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside
.                  F                      G
 There's a better life, There's a better life

[C1]
.                 C            G     C
   If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
.               G                 C
   If you feel lost, He's a way maker
.                Am
   If you need freedom or saving
.           F
   He's a prison shaking Savior
.                G                    C
   If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

[V2]
.             C
 We've all searched for the light of day in the dead
 of night
.           Am
 We've all found ourselves worn out from the same
 old fight
.           G
 We've all run to things we know just ain't right
.                       F   Am                 G
 When there's a better life, There's a better life

[B1]
.  C
   If you believe it
.  Am             F
   If you receive it
.  C
   If you can feel it
.             Am   F
   Somebody testify</lyrics>
