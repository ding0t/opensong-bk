<lyrics>[V1]
 We find many people who can't
 understand, why we are
 so happy and free;
 We've crossed over Jordan
 to Canaan's fair land,
 And this is like Heaven to me.

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   Oh, this is like Heaven to me, (Praise God!)
   Yes, this is like Heaven to me;
   I've crossed over Jordan
   to Canaan's fair land,
   And this is like Heaven to me.

[V2]
 Oh, when I get happy,
 I sing and I shout,
 the devil don't believe It, I see;
 But I'm filled with the Spirit,
 there isn't a doubt,
 And that's what's the matter with me.</lyrics>
