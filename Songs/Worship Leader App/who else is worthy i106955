<lyrics>[V1]
 I am an instrument of exaltation
 And I was born to lift Your name above all names
 You hear the melody of all creation
 But there's a song of praise that only I can bring

[C1]
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus

[V2]
 You are the infinite God of the ages
 Yet You chose to make my heart Your dwelling place
 You healed my brokennеss, showed me Your glory
 So I have songs of thanks not еven angels sing

[C2]
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
   Who else is worthy? Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus

[B1]
   Lamb of God, anointed one
   Who was and is and is to come
   Seated on the throne above
   Holy, Holy
   Righteous one who shed His blood
   You proved to us the Father's love
   Jesus Christ be lifted up
   Holy, Holy
   Lamb of God, anointed one
   Who was and is and is to come
   Seated on the throne above
   Holy, Holy
   Righteous one who shed His blood
   You proved to us the Father's love
   Jesus Christ be lifted up
   Holy, Holy
   Lamb of God, anointed one
   Who was and is and is to come
   Seated on the throne above
   Holy, Holy
   (You are, You are)
   Righteous one who shed His blood
   You proved to us the Father's love
   Jesus Christ be lifted up</lyrics>
