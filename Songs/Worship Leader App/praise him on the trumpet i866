 Praise Him On The Trumpet
 The Psaltery and harp
 Praise Him On The Timbrel And The Dance
 Praise Him With Stringed Instruments, Too
 Praise Him On The Loud Cymbals
 Praise Him On The Loud Cymbals
 Let Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord

[V2]
 Hallelujah, Praise The Lord
 Hallelujah, Praise The Lord
 Let Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
 Hallelujah, Praise The Lord
 Hallelujah, Praise The Lord
 Let Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord</lyrics>
