<title>Father Make Us One</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Father make us one,
 Father, make us one,
 That the world may know
 Thou hast sent the Son,
 Father, make us one.

[V2]
 Behold how pleasant
 and how good it is
 For brethren to dwell in unity,
 For there the Lord
 commands the blessing,
 Life forever more.</lyrics>
