<lyrics>[V1]
 When the darkness fills my senses
 When my blindness keeps me from Your touch
 Jesus come

[V2]
 When my burden keeps me doubting
 When my memories take the place of You
 Jesus come

[V3]
 And I'll follow You there
 To the place where we meet
 And I'll lay down my pride
 As You search me again

[V4]
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love
 Your unfailing love over me again
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love
 Your unfailing love over me again</lyrics>
