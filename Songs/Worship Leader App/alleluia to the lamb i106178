<lyrics>[V1]
 We've gathered here on holy ground
 Angels hovering all around
 Stand now before Him, oh, magnify Him
 Alleluia to the Lamb!

[C1]
   Adoration and praises fill my soul
   Alleluias I will bestow
   I will sing to the Lord, lifting my hands
   Alleluia to the Lamb!

[V2]
 King of Kings and Lord of Lords
 We come to you in one accord
 Holy, holy, Lamb of Glory
 Alleluia to the Lamb!</lyrics>
