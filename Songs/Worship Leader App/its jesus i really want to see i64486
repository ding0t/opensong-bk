<lyrics>[V1]
 I have truly known the good life filled with family and friends
 I have been blessed with more than my shares
 Yet with all of my good fortune
 My heart is seeking still
 No, I just can't t deny the longing there

[C1]
   Chorus
   It's Jesus I really want to see
   The more I see of this world, the less it means to me
   For it's Jesus I really want to see

[V2]
 I have been a lot of places
 And I have known the great and small
 I have seen the grand and noble works of me
 But in all of all my heart
 I know there's much for me
 So much more than this faded world at hand

[V3]
 Chorus2
 It's Jesus I really want to see
 The more I see of this world, the less it means to me
 For it's Jesus I really want to see</lyrics>
