 If you're happy and you know it,
 clap your hands (2x)
 If you're happy and you know it,
 and you really want to show it,
 If you're happy and you know it,
 clap your hands!

[V2]
 If you're happy and you know it,
 say amen (2x)
 If you're happy and you know it,
 and you really want to show it,
 If you're happy and you know it,
 say amen!</lyrics>
