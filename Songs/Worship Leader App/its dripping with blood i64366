<lyrics>[V1]
 The first one to die for
 This Holy Ghost plan,
 Was John the Baptist,
 But he died like a man;
 Then came the Lord Jesus,
 They crucified Him,
 He taught that the Spirit
 Would save men from sin.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   It's dripping with blood, Yes,
   It's dripping with blood,
   This Holy Ghost Gospel
   Is dripping with blood,
   The blood of disciples
   Who died for the Truth,
   This Holy Ghost Gospel
   Is dripping with blood.

[V2]
 There was Peter and Paul,
 And John the divine,
 They gave up their lives so
 This Gospel could shine;
 They mingled their blood,
 Like the prophets of old,
 So the true Word of God
 Could honest be told.

[V3]
 Then they stoned Stephen,
 He preached against sin,
 He made them so angry,
 They dashed his head in;
 But he died in the Spirit,
 And gave up the ghost,
 And went to join others,
 In that life-giving host.

[V4]
 There's souls under the altar,
 Crying, &quot;How long?&quot;
 For the Lord to punish
 Those who've done wrong;
 But there's going to be more
 Who'll give their life's blood
 For this Holy Ghost Gospel
 And its crimson flood.</lyrics>
