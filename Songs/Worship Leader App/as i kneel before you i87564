 As I kneel before you,
 As I bow my head in prayer,
 Take this day, make it yours
 and fill me with your love.

[C1]
   Ave Maria,
   Gratia plena,
   Dominus tecum,
   Benedicta tu.

[V2]
 All I have I give you,
 Every dream and wish are yours,
 Mother of Christ,
 Mother of mine, present them to my Lord.

[V3]
 As I kneel before you,
 And I see your smiling face,
 Ev'ry thought, ev'ry word
 Is lost in your embrace.</lyrics>
