<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Move among us with holy fire
 As we lay aside all earthly desires
 Hands reach out and our hearts aspire
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
 Holy Spirit we welcome You

[V2]
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Let the breeze of Your presence blow
 That Your children here might truly know
 How to move in the Spirit's flow
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
 Holy Spirit we welcome You

[V3]
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Holy Spirit we welcome You
 Please accomplish in me today
 Some new work of loving grace I pray
 Unreservedly have Your way
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
 Holy Spirit we welcome You</lyrics>
