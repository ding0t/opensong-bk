<lyrics>[C1]
   Only believe, only believe,
   All things are possible, only believe;
   Only believe, only believe,
   All things are possible, only believe.
   (Lord, I believe...)
   (Lord, I receive...)
   (Jesus is here...)

[V1]
 Fear not, little flock,
 From the cross to the throne;
 From death into life
 He went for His own;
 All power in earth,
 All power above,
 Is given to Him
 For the flock of His love.

[C2]
   Only believe, only believe,
   All things are possible, only believe;
   Only believe, only believe,
   All things are possible, only believe.

[V2]
 Fear not, little flock,
 He goeth ahead,
 Your shepherd selecteth
 The path you must tread;
 The waters of Marah
 He'll sweeten for thee,
 He drank all the bitter
 in Gethsemane.

[V3]
 Fear not, little flock,
 What ever your lot,
 He enters all rooms,
 &quot;The doors being shut;&quot;
 He never forsakes,
 He never is gone,
 So count on His presence
 In darkness and dawn.</lyrics>
