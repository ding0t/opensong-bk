<title>Spirit And The Bride</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Deep within
 There's a fire that can't be quenched
 A love for You as strong as death
 Hear us Lord
 The longing of our hearts
 is to be where You are not apart

[P1]
   We feel You near
   Your presence all around us
   Oh Lord we want to see Your face
   So take us away

[C1]
   The Spirit and the bride cry out to You
   Lord we cry out to You
   Come quickly
   We long for the day
   When we will see Your face
   We long to be with You
   Come quickly
   And breathe on us until You come
   Breathe on us until You come</lyrics>
