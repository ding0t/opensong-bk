<title>Always Good</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You meet me on the mountain top
 You see in me in the valley low
 There is no home without You here

[V2]
 I find You in the crowded thoughts
 You quiet all the question marks
 There is no space Your love won't fill

[P1]
   I'll trade all my fear for peace of mind
   All my heaviness for burdens light

[C1]
   This will be my song
   That You are always good
   I'll sing it all day long
   That You are always good
   When the day is through
   I am left with
   You are always
   You are always good

[V3]
 I'll set my eyes on perfect faith
 You'll finish what You start in me
 My heart will be an offering

[B1]
   Every melody
   You're singing back to me
   You're singing back

[P2]
   I traded all my fear for peace of mind
   You took heaviness, my burden's light</lyrics>
