 Chorus:
.    G  Am  C D
 I awaited__
.         G       Am C D
 For the Lord on High
.    G  Am C D
 I awaited,
.                G  Am C D
 And He heard my cry.  (repeat)

[V2]
 Verse 1:
.   Em7       D/F#     G
 He pulled me out of my despair
.    Em7       D/F#          C
 And showed me where to walk:
.     Em7   D/F#   G
 From fear into security
.      Em7     D/F#       C
 From quicksand into rock.

[V3]
 Verse 2:
 I sing to let the people know
 That I have been restored.
 So they will kneel and understand
 To return and trust in the Lord.</lyrics>
