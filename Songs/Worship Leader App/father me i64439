<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 Father, father me, I need your love, I need your love
 Father, pardon me
 I feel so alone, longing for a home
 I need comfort, I need shelter
 I need healing for my soul
 Take this fear that I surrender
 Take me in, take me home, father me
 Father, father me, call me by name, call me by name

[V2]
 Father, oh please pardon me, take me to your home
 Adopt me as your own
 I need comfort, I need shelter
 I need healing for my soul
 Take this pain that I surrender
 Take me in, take me home
 Father, father me, I need your love, I need your love
 Father, father me, take me to your home
 Adopt me as your own, father me</lyrics>
