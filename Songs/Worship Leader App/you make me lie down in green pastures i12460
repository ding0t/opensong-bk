<title>You Make Me Lie Down in Green Pastures</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You make me lie down
 In green pastures
 You make me wanting for nothing
 You fill my hunger
 With honey from your sweet sweet word

[V2]
 You let me worship before you
 So I will love you and adore you
 You are my Shepherd
 You are my Jesus
 You are my Lord</lyrics>
</song>
