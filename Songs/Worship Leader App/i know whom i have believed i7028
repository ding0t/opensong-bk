<aka>I know Not Why</aka>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I know not why God's wondrous grace
 To me He hath made known,
 Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
 Redeemed me for His own.

[C1]
   Refrain:
   But &quot;I know Whom I have believed,
   And am persuaded that He is able
   To keep that which I've committed
   Unto Him against that day.&quot;

[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith
 To me He did impart,
 Nor how believing in His Word
 Wrought peace within my heart.

[C2]
   I know not how the Spirit moves,
   Convincing men of sin,
   Revealing Jesus through the Word,
   Creating faith in Him.

[V3]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me,
 Of weary ways or golden days,
 Before His face I see.

[V4]
 I know not when my Lord may come,
 At night or noonday fair,
 Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
 Or meet Him in the air.</lyrics>
