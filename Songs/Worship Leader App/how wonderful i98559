<lyrics>[C1]
   How wonderful, how glorious
   is the love of God,
   Bringing healing, forgiveness,
   Wonderful love.

[V1]
 Let celebration
 echo through this land;
 We bring reconciliation,
 We bring hope to every man:

[V2]
 We proclaim the kingdom
 Of our God is here;
 Come and join the heavenly anthem,
 Ringing loud and ringing clear:

[V3]
 Listen to the music
 as His praises fill the air;
 With joy and with gladness
 Tell the people everywhere:</lyrics>
