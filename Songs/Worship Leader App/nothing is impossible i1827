.D                            A                    Bm
 Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
.                                G                         D
 Cause its you who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
.D                               A                       Bm
 Through you, blind eyes are open, Strongholds are broken
.                 G
 I am living by faith, nothing is impossible

 I'm not gonna live by what I feel

.  Bm           A                G

   I know that, You can do anything
