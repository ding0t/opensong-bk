.E                                 B C#m A
  Never before have i felt so alive
.E                                      B  A
  Never before have i thought i could fly__
.E                                     B A
  Never before have i ever been so free
.E                                        B C#m A
  'Cause being with you i now begin to see

[V2]
.F#m             E
 That your presence
.Am         Bm
 Overwhelms me

[C1]
.              E         C#m
   Because of you i can dance
.             G#              A
   Because of you i lift my hands
.              E         G#m
   Because of you i can sing
.        A
   I am free

[V3]
. E
 We're jumping
.  C#m
 Shouting, dancing
.  E
 Spinning, singing
.      A
 There's freedom</lyrics>
