.G      D2/F#       B5
 Jesus, Lover of my soul,
.Em7           Am7           C/D
 Jesus, I will never let You go.
.G               D2/F#         B5
 You've taken me from the miry clay,
.Em7                Am7            C/D
 Set my feet upon a rock and now I know:

[C1]
.  G         D/F#
   I love You, I need You,
.  Em        Dm11                Cmaj7            C/D
   Though my world may fall I'll never let You go.
.  G        D/F#
   My Savior, my closest Friend,
.  Em     Dm11         Cmaj7
   I will worship You until the very end.

[B1]
.  Em     Dm11         Cmaj7
   I will worship you until the very end.</lyrics>
