<lyrics>[V1]
 Take us to the river
 Take us there in unity to sing
 a song of Your salvation
 To win this generation for our King
 A song of Your forgiveness
 For it is with grace that river flows
 Take us to the river
 In the city of our God

[C1]
   The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us
   This is the year of the Lord
   The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us
   This is the year of the Lord

[V2]
 Take us to the throne room
 And give us ears to hear the cry of Heaven
 For that cry is mercy
 Mercy to the fallen sons of men
 Mercy it has triumphed
 Triumphed over judgement
 by Your blood
 Take us to the throne room
 in the city of our God

[V3]
 Take us to the mountain
 Lift us in the shadow of Your hand
 Is this Your mighty angel
 Who stands astride the ocean and the land
 In His hand Your mercy
 showers O'er a dry and barren place
 Take us to the mountain
 In the city of our God</lyrics>
