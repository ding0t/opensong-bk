<lyrics>[C1]
   All my life, all I know
   God's been good, good to my soul
   Mountain high, valley low
   I'm gonna sing wherever I go

[V1]
 God is for me, He's not against me
 I will hold to the plans He has for me
 When I'm broken He will fix me
 I will call on the name of the Lord

[V2]
 He's my heart song in my sorrow
 He's my hope and my strength for tomorrow
 When the storms rise all around me
 I will call on the name of the Lord</lyrics>
