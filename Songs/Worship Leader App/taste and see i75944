 Taste and see how good our God can be.
 O Taste and see how good our God can be.

[V2]
 1. I will bless the Lord at all times;
.    
     My mouth will proclaim His praise.
.    
     My soul makes its boast in the Lord our God
.    
     Let the humble hear and be glad.

[V3]
 Taste and see how good our God can be.
 O Taste and see how good our God can be.

[V4]
 2. Come glorify the Lord with me,
 Together let us praise His name.
 Look to Him and grow bright in His radiant light,
 And your face will never be ashamed.

[V5]
 Taste and see how good our God can be.
 O Taste and see how good our God can be.

[V6]
 3. The eyes of the Lord are on the just,
.    
     And His ear toward all their cries.
.    
     The Lord is near to the broken heart
.    
     And the crushed in spirit He saves.

[V7]
 Taste and see how good our God can be.
 O Taste and see how good our God can be.

[V8]
 4. O taste and see the Lord is good,
.    
     And happy are those who trust in Him.
.    
     O fear the Lord you His holy ones,
.    
     Trust in Him and lack no good thing.</lyrics>
