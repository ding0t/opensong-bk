<lyrics>[V1]
.G                  C2                 G                          D
 What a fellowship, what a joy divine! Leaning on the everlasting arms;
.G                   C2                    G                  D       G
 What a blessedness, what a peace is mine! Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[V2]
.G                   C2                   G                          D
 O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, Leaning on the everlasting arms;
.G                     C2                     G                  D       G
 O how bright the path grows from day to day, Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[V3]
.G                     C2                   G                          D
 What have I to dread? What have I to fear? Leaning on the everlasting arms;
.G                    C2                    G                  D       G
 I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[C1]
.  G        C2       G                         D
   Leaning, leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms;
.  G        C2       G                  D       G
   Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.</lyrics>
