  Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away, Slain for us:an___d we remember
.F                        G        (C)                     Dm   C  G         F G C
  The promise made that all who come in faith. Find forgiveness at the cross.

[V2]
 Chorus:

 So we share in this Bread of life, And we drink of His sacrifice,
.              F                        C     F  G
 As a sign of our bonds of (peace / love / grace)

  Around the table of the King.

  The body of our Savior, Jesus Christ, Torn for you: eat and remember
.F                       G        (C)                                Dm   C  G       F G C
  The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life, Paid the price to make us one.

.F                    G       (C)                     Dm   C G                F C G
  The blood that cleanses every stain of sin, Shed for you: drink and remember
.F                                G        (C)             Dm   C  G       F G C

  And so with thankfulness and faith we rise, to respond:an___d to remember.

  Our call to follow in the steps of Christ as His body here on earth.

 As we share in His suffering, We proclaim: Christ will come again!
.                 F                          C     F  G     F        G C
 And we'll join in the feast of heaven, Around the table of the King.</lyrics>
