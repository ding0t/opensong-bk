 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you, Lord
 The whole world is yours
 And I want to live for you

[V2]
 One thing I know
 Is that you've changed my life
 I give you my all
 All you are is good

[V3]
 Give you my heart
 God it's only you I seek
 Give you my praise
 'Cause I believe in you

[V4]
 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you, Lord
 The whole world is yours
 And I want to live for you, O God

[V5]
 All that I know
 Is that you've changed my life
 I give you my all
 And all you are is good

[V6]
 Carry the lost
 Make my prayer in this life real Carry my cross
 Hold on 'til I see you

[V7]
 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you, Lord
 The whole world is yours
 And I want to live for you, O God

[V8]
 And I want to live
 I want to love you more
 I want to be used
 Father in all of the world
 May your word be heard
 May it stay on my lips
 To live what I speak
 Until your kingdom come

[V9]
 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you
 And let us shine for you

[V10]
 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you, Lord
 The whole world is yours
 And I want to live for you

[V11]
 Look across the world
 And let us shine for you, Lord
 The whole world is yours

[V12]
 And I want to live for you
 And I want to live for you
 And I want to live for you</lyrics>
