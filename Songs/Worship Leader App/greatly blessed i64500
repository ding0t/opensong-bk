<lyrics>[V1]
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured*
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God
 [Repeat

[V2]
 Standing upright on God's good earth
 Count my blessings, great things He has done
 Fighting the good fight with the blessed assurance
 That the battle is already won

[V3]
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God

[V4]
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God
 Greatly Blessed and Highly Favoured
 Imperfect but forgiven child of God
 Child of God, I'm a child of God</lyrics>
