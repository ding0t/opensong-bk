<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh kneel me down again, Here at your feet
 Show me how much You love humility
 Oh Spirit be the Star that leads me to
 The Humble heart of love I see in You

[C1]
   You are the God of the broken
   The friend of the weak
   You wash the feet of the weary
   Embraced the ones in need
   I want to be like You, Jesus
   To have this heart in me
   You are the God of the humble
   You are the Humble King</lyrics>
