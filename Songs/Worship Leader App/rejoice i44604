<title>Rejoice</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.           G
 Come and stand before your maker
.         C
 Full of wonder, full of fear;
.        G
 Come behold his power and glory
.          C
 Yet with confidence draw near,
.        Em
 For the one who holds the heavens
.        D
 And commands the stars above
.        C
 Is the God who bends to bless us
.                     D
 With an unrelenting love.

[C1]
.     G               Em
   Rejoice! Come and lift your hands and
.    C         G
   Raise your voice;
.         Em             C
   He is worthy of all praise,
.     Em              C
   Rejoice! Sing the mercies of your King
.             Em    D      G
   And with trembling, rejoice.

[V2]
.         G
 We are children of the promise,
.       C
 The beloved of the Lord.
.         G
 Won with everlasting kindness,
.             C
 Bought with sacrificial blood.
.          Em
 Bringing reconciliation
.      D
 To a world that longs to know
.       C
 The affections of a father
.                         D
 Who will never let them go.

[V3]
.         G
 All our sickness, all our sorrows
.       C
 Jesus carried up the hill.
.        G
 He has walked this path before us,
.       C
 He is walking with us still;
.          Em
 Turning tragedy to triumph,
.        D
 Turning agony to praise,
.           C
 There is blessing in the battle
.                          D
 So take heart and stand amazed.</lyrics>
