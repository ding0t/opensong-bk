<lyrics>[V1]
.G
 I am so glad that our Father in heaven
.D7                       C       D7  G
 Tells of His love in the Book He has given.
.G
 Wonderful things in my Bible I see-
.D7                        C     D7    G
 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

[V2]
.G
 Tho' I forget Him and wander away,
.D7                        C    D7 G
 Still He doth love me wherever I  stray.
.G
 Back to His dear, loving arms would I flee
.D7                   C     D7    G
 When I remember that Jesus loves me.

[V3]
.G
 O if there's only one song I can sing
.D7                   C       D7    G
 When in His beauty I see the great King,
.G
 This shall my song in eternity be:
.D7                     C     D7    G
 &quot;O what a wonder, that Jesus loves me!&quot;

[C1]
.  G                 C
   I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
.  D7              G
   Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.
.  G                 C
   I am so glad that Jesus loves me;
.  D7          C  D   G
   Jesus loves e__ven me.</lyrics>
