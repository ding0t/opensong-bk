<title>Love Of My Lord</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 For I know that nothing can keep me
 From the love of my Lord
 Neither death nor life,
 The fears we have today,
 Or our worries for tomorrow
 For the angels speed it on its way,
 And the powers of hell itself
 Can not keep it away!

[C1]
   It makes no difference
   If I'm on mountain top
   Or at the ocean's end,
   For the Lord has made it all,
   And all is in his hands!</lyrics>
