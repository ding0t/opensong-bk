 Verse 1:
.Esus2               Dsus2
 Sorrow is a lonely feeling
.   Asus              Cmaj7
 Unsettled is a painful place
.Esus2                  Dsus2
 I've lived with both for far too long now
.A                 Cmaj7
 Since we've parted ways
.          Esus2               Dsus2
 I've been wrestling with my conscience
.        A             Cmaj7
 And I found myself to blame
.Cmaj7                  Cm7
 If there's to be any resolution
.Cmaj7                Cm7
 I've got to peel my pride away

[V2]
 Chorus:
.G
 Just between you and me
.Em9
 I've got somethin' to say
 EbM7
 I wanna get it straight
.F
 Before the sun goes down
.G
 Just between you and me
.Em9
 Confession needs to be made
.EbM7               F
 Recompense is my way to freedom (now)
.G
 Just between you and me
.Em9                     F
 I've got something to say

[V3]
 Verse 2:
.Esus2                       Dsus2
 If confession is the road to healing
.A                           Cmaj7
 Forgiveness is the promised land
.Esus2               Dsus2
 I'm reaching out in my conviction
.Asus2                 Cmaj7
 I'm longing to make amends
.        Esus2                  Dsus2
 So, I'm sorry for the words I've spoken
.A                    Cmaj7
 For I've betrayed a friend
.Cmaj7                  Cm7
 We have a love that's worth preserving
.Cmaj7         Cm7
 And a bond I will defend

[V4]

.G
 Just between you and me

 I've got somethin' to say

 I wanna get it straight
.F
 Before the sun goes down
.G
 Just Between you and me
.Em9
 Confession needs to be made
.EbM7              F
 Recompense is my way to freedom (now)
.G
 Just between you and me
.C9                     F
 I've got something to say

[V6]
 Bridge:
.Gm                  F
 In my pursuit of God I thirst for holiness
.Gm                  F
 As I approach the Son I must consider this
.Gm              F
 Offenses unresolved will keep me from the throne
.Gm              F
 Before I go to him my wrong must be atoned
 Pre-Chorus

 I've got to peel my pride away
