<lyrics>[V1]
.D                A
 The prophets foretold
.             Bm
 A king would come
.G         D
 Born to a virgin
.   Em    A
 Of lowly estate

[V2]
 You who are poor
 And discouraged
 Take courage for
 Your king is here
 He will not falter
 Or be discouraged
 Till his kingdom come

[C1]
   Giver of joy giver of hope giver of peace giver of life
   Giver of every good thing has come into the world
   Giver of joy giver of hope giver of peace giver of life
   Giver of every good thing has come into the world

[C2]
   Giver of joy giver of hope giver of peace giver of life (x5)

[V3]
 Sing to the Lord a new song
 Praise Him to the ends of the earth
 You who go down to the sea
 You islands praise the Lord</lyrics>
