<lyrics>[V1]
 I am weary from the waves
 Crashing over every day
 God of mercy, please come rescue me
 I am longing for Your voice
 Gentle whisper in the noise
 Father, tell me everything's all right, yeah

[V2]
 Your power and Your presence
 Breaks strongholds, King of Heaven
 When You speak, mountains move
 I believe there will be breakthrough, yeah

[V3]
 You alone can take my scars
 And piece by piece restore my heart
 Take what's broken, make it whole again, oh-oh

[V4]
 'Cause Your power and Your presence
 Breaks strongholds, King of Heaven
 When You speak, mountains move
 I believe there will be breakthrough, oh-oh
 There will be breakthrough, oh

[V5]
 Shake the mountains, break the walls apart
 Open the Heavens, Almighty God, You are
 Overcomer, Defender of my heart
 It's who You are, God
 By Your power, the oceans open wide
 Your fire falls down, Heaven and Earth collide
 King Jesus, forever by my side
 Shake the mountains, yes
 Shake the mountains, break the walls apart
 Open the Heavens, Almighty God, You are
 Overcomer, Defender of my heart, oh-oh, yeah
 And by Your power, the oceans open wide
 Your fire falls down , Heaven and Earth collide
 King Jesus, forever by my side, yeah

[V6]
 'Cause Your power and Your presence
 Breaks strongholds, King of Heaven
 When You speak, mountains move
 I believe there will be breakthrough
 And Your power and Your presence
 Breaks strongholds, King of Heaven
 When You speak, mountains move
 I believe there will be breakthrough
 There will be breakthrough
 There will be breakthrough
 I know, I know, I know
 There will be breakthrough

[V7]
 I know You are moving now, God
 I know You are healing now, God
 You are moving, You are healing, You are speaking
 There will be, there will be victory
 I know, I know, I know

[V8]
 There will be, there will be victory here
 There will be, there will be victory here
 There will be, there will be victory, oh-oh
 There will be, there will be victory here
 There will be, there will be victory here
 There will be, there will be victory here

 Shake the mountains, you sing , break the walls apart
 Open the Heavens, Almighty God, You are
 Overcomer, Defender of my heart
 And by Your power, the oceans open wide
 Your fire falls down, Heaven and Earth collide
 King Jesus, forever by my side
 Shake the mountains, shake the mountains
