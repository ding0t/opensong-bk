<title>A Thousand Hallelujahs</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
 Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
 Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
 But this joy is mine

[C1]
   With a thousand hallelujahs
   We magnify Your name
   You alone deserve the glory
   The honor and the praise
   Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
   A thousand hallelujahs
   And a thousand more

[V2]
 Who else would die for our redemption?
 Whose resurrection means I'll rise?
 There isn't time enough to sing of all You've done
 But I have eternity to try

[B1]
   Praise to the Lord
   To the lamb
   To the King of Heaven
   Praise for He rose
   Now He reigns
   We will sing forever</lyrics>
