<lyrics>[V1]
.G               C                        G
 One day when Heaven was filled with His praises
.             C                        G
 One day when sin was as black as could be
.           C                       G
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
.           C                   Am7
 Dwelt among men, my example is He
.            C                           Em
 Word became flesh and the light shined among us
.            C
 His glory revealed

[C1]
.              G
   Living, He loved me
.              D
   Dying, He saved me
.               Em                 C
   Buried, He carried my sins far away
.    G                          D
   Rising, He justified freely forever
.               Em
   One day Hes coming
.              C                G  C
   Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

[V2]
.G               C                        G
 One day they led Him up Calvarys mountain
.             C                        G
 One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
.             C                        G
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
.           C                   Am7
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
.            C                           Em
 Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
.            C
 And took the nails for me

[V3]
.G               C                        G
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
.             C                        G
 One day the stone rolled away from the door
.             C                        G
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered
.           C                   Am7
 Now Hes ascended, my Lord evermore
.            C                           Em
 Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
.            C
 From rising again

[B1]
   .C G D
   One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
   .C G D Em
   One day the skies with His glories will shine
   .C G D Em
   Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing
   .C
   My Savior, Jesus, is mine

   Living, He loved me
.             D
   Dying, He saved me
.               Em                 C
   Buried, He carried my sins far away
.    G                          D
   Rising, He justified freely forever
.               Em
   One day Hes coming
.              C                G  C
   Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
