<lyrics>[V1]
.E               B
 God will make a way,
.            A              E
 where there seems to be no way;
.   A                E/G#   C#m
 He works in ways we cannot see,
.F#m            B
 He will make a way for me.
.E             B
 He will be my guide,
.        A              E
 hold me closely to His side;
.     A
 with love and strength
.    E        C#m
 for each new day,
.F#m            B
 He will make a way,
.A       A/B    E
 He will make a way.

[V2]
.     C               D
 By a road way in the wilderness
.      G
 He'll lead me.
.    C             D             E
 And rivers in the desert will I see
.A                     B
 Heaven and Earth will fade,
.        G#m             C#m
 but His Word will still remain
.    A          B               C#
 And He will do something new today</lyrics>
