<lyrics>[V1]
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
 Was blind but now I see

[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[V3]
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares
 I have already come
 This grace that brought me safe thus far
 And grace will lead me home

[V4]
 When we've been here ten thousand years
 Bright, shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 Than when we first begun

[V5]
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
 Was blind but now I see</lyrics>
