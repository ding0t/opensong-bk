<lyrics>[V1]
 Nations are breaking,
 Israel's awaking,
 The signs that the prophets
 foretold;
 The Gentile days numbered,
 With horrors encumbered;
 Eternity soon will unfold.

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   The day of redemption is near,
   Men's hearts are failing for fear;
   Be filled with the Spirit,
   Your lamps trimmed and clear,
   Look up! Your redemption is near.

[V2]
 The fig tree is growing;
 Jerusalem's restoring
 Her national life, long dethroned;
 Today she is calling,
 Her latter rain's falling,
 &quot;Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.&quot;

[V3]
 Heaven's powers are shaking,
 And many are mistaking
 God's meaning to be of the sky;
 God's Church is the power
 That's shaking this hour:
 The day of redemption is nigh.

[V4]
 False prophets are lying,
 God's Truth they're denying,
 That Jesus the Christ is our God;
 Though this generation
 Spurns God's revelation,
 We'll walk where the apostles
 have trod.</lyrics>
