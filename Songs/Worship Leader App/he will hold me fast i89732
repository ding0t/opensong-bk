[V3]
 Those He saves are His delight, Christ will hold me fast;
 Precious in his holy sight, He will hold me fast.
 He'll not let my soul be lost; His promises shall last;
 Bought by Him at such a cost, He will hold me fast.

[V4]
 For my life He bled and died, Christ will hold me fast;
 Justice has been satisfied; He will hold me fast.
 Raised with Him to endless life, He will hold me fast
 'Till our faith is turned to sight, When He comes at last!</lyrics>
