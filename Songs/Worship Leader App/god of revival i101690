<lyrics>[V1]
 We see what you can do, oh God of wonders
 Your power has no end
 The things You've done before in greater measure
 You will do again
 'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through, no

[V2]
 Mountain You can't move, all things are possible
 The darkest night, You can light it up
 You can light it up, God of revival
 Let hope arise, death is overcome
 You've already won, God of revival
 You rose in victory and now You're seated
 Forever on the throne, oh forever on the throne
 So why should my heart fear what You've defeated
 I will trust in You alone
 'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through, no
 Mountain You can't move, all things are possible
 There's no broken body you can't raise, no
 Soul that You can't save, all things are possible
 The darkest night, You can light it up
 You can light it up, oh God of revival
 Let hope arise, death is overcome
 You've already won, oh God of revival
 God of revival
 Yeah, yeah
 Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
 Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
 Every stronghold will crumble and I hear the chains hit the ground
 Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
 Oh, the darkest night, You can light it up
 You can light it up, oh God of revival
 Let hope arise, death is overcome
 You've already won, oh God of revival
 Oh God of revival
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
 God of revival (yeah, yeah)</lyrics>
