<lyrics>[V1]
 He is our God
 Let all creation bow
 The sovereign King Most Holy One
 He sacrificed His life
 Washed and cleansed within
 Portioned by faith
 We're destined to win

[C1]
   Everything that has breath
   Praise the Lord
   Everything that's in me
   Praise the Lord
   I can praise Him on the highest mountain
   Praise Him in the lowest valley
   Everything that's in me
   Praise the Lord</lyrics>
