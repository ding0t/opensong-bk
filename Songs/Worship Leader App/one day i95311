 Verse
 More than I could hope or dream of
 You have poured Your favour on me
 One day in the house of God is better
 Than a thousand days in the world

[V2]
 Chorus
 So blessed
 I can't contain it
 So much
 I've got to give it away
 Your love
 has taught me to live now
 You are more than enough for me

[V3]
 Bridge
 Lord You're more than enough for me
 Lord You're more than enough for me</lyrics>
