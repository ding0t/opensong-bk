<lyrics>[V1]
.A
 I keep fighting voices
.      C#m                    F#m  (D)
 in my mind that say I'm not enough
. A
 Every single lie that tells me
.C#m                  F#m (D)
 I will never measure up__
.A
 Am I more than just the sum
.    C#m                 F#m (D)
 of every high and every low?
.    A                           C#m
 Remind me once again just who I am,
.                   F#m      D
 because I need to know (ooh oh)

[C1]
.                 A                        C#m
   You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
.                F#m                      D
   You say I am strong when I think I am weak
.                A                      C#m
   You say I am held when I am falling short
.                  F#m                        D
   When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
.           A                 C#m
   And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
.                  F#m
   What You say of me (I)
.        D
   I believe

[V2]
.     A
 The only thing that matters now
.    C#m                    F#m (D)
 is everything You think of me__
.   A
 In You I find my worth,
.         C#M           F#m      D
 in You I find my identity, (ooh oh)

[C2]
.                 A                        C#m
   You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
.                F#m                      D
   You say I am strong when I think I am weak
.                A                      C#m
   You say I am held when I am falling short
.                  F#m                        D
   When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
.           A                 C#m
   And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
.                  F#m
   What You say of me (I)
.        D
   I believe

[V3]
. A
 Taking all I have and now
.     C#m               F#m  (D)
 I'm laying it at Your feet__
. A
 You have every failure God,
.    C#m                     F#m      D
 and You'll have every victory, (ooh oh)

[C3]
.                 A                        C#m
   You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
.                F#m                      D
   You say I am strong when I think I am weak
.                A                      C#m
   You say I am held when I am falling short
.                  F#m                        D
   When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
.           A                 C#m
   And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
.                  F#m
   What You say of me (I)
.        D
   I believe

[C4]
.           A                 C#m
   Oh I believe (I), yes I believe (I)
.                  F#m
   What You say of me (I)
.          D        (A C#m F#m D A)
   Oh I believe (oh)</lyrics>
