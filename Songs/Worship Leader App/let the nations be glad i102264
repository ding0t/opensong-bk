<lyrics>[V1]
.        A
 Let the glory of the Lord forever be a joy
.                                E      D
 May redemption be the theme of our song
.       A
 For by grace we have been saved
.       F#m
 And by grace we shall proclaim
.       A              E                     D   E
 To the corners of the earth that Christ has come

[C1]
.          D          A             D   E   F#m
   Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice
.         D        A            E
   For salvation belongs to our God
.          D              A               D       E      F#m

[V2]
.            A
 Through the ages gone before
 Through the trial and the sword
.                                            E    D
 Many saints and martyrs conquered though they died
.            A
 Still we're holding out the cross
.         F#m
 Crossing ocean suffering loss
.       A                   E                D   E
 Shall endure all things to win the crown of life

   Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord
.        D        A             E
   For salvation belongs to our God

[V3]
.        A
 As your holy church goes forth, in the Holy Spirit's power
.                                     E   D
 With the glories of the Gospel to explain
.       F#m
 Now we pray Your kingdom come
.       E/G#              A
 And we pray Your will be done
.        D             E             F#m
 For the honor and the glory of Your name

   For salvation belongs to our God
