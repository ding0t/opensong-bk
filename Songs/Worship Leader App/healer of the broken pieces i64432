<lyrics>[V1]
 You are the Healer - the Healer of my Heart
 The Maker and the God of all we are
 I was the broken vessel in Your Hand
 But You looked beyond the hurt
 And made me whole again

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Healer of the broken pieces
   You touched my heart and made it new
   Now my whole life I surrender
   Lay it down before the Mender
   Lord I give my Life to you
   Love that sought before I knew You
   Has brought me near to where You are
   Now I live to praise You
   Ever may I praise You
   Healer of my Heart

[V2]
 Nothing compares Lord
 To knowing You
 and seeing what
 The Grace of God can do
 You faithfully sought me
 When You called me Your own
 And You made a way
 To bring my wanderingheart back home</lyrics>
