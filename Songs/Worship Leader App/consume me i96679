 Verse 1:
.Bm C#m  F#m
 Lovely traces
.       Bm   C#m      F#m
 I can sense You in everything

 I'm overtaken

 By the way that You deliver me I'm transcended
.D                                      E
 There's no place I'd rather be, Than here in heaven
.D                                  E
 Without You I'm incomplete, It's hopeless

 Like a burning flame running through my veins
.        Bm            F#m

 Anytime anyplace You invade my space

 I am in Your hands
