<lyrics>[V1]
 We have a vision for this nation
 We share a dream for this land
 We join with angels in celebration
 By faith we speak revival in this land

[C1]
   Where every knee shall bow and worship You
   And every tongue confess that You are Lord
   Give us an open heaven
   Anoint our prayers this day
   And move Your sovereign hand
   Across this nation</lyrics>
