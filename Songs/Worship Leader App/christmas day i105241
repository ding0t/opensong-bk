 Joy to the world
 On a night like no other
 Emmanuel, God is with us
 Beggars and kings
 Let us come and adore Him
 Rest in His peace
 And bow before Him

[C1]
   Sing all you people
   The Lord Almighty reigns
   Sing every creature of God
   Come bless His name
   For He is good, for He is good
   He was born to conquer the grave
   Light of the world
   The reason for Christmas day

[V2]
 Stars we have seen
 Over deserts and oceans
 The darkness was deep
 But never hopeless
 Redemption came
 And His name is Jesus

[B1]
   From the mountains
   We will shout it out
   For the Lord our God Almighty reigns
   He is with us
   He is with us now
   For the Lord our God Almighty reigns</lyrics>
