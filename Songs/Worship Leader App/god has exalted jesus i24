<lyrics>[V1]
 God has exalted Jesus to the highest place
 Giving Him the Name that is above every name
 That at the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow
 And every tongue confess that He is Lord

 Hallelujah hosanna, Hallelujah hosanna,
 Hallelujah hosanna, Hallelujah hosanna,
 Hallelujah hosanna, Hallelujah hosanna,
 Hallelujah hosanna, Hallelujah hosanna.
 Halalango Jesu, Halalango Jesu,

[V3]
 Halalango Jesu Halala o halala
 Halalango Jesu, Halalango Jesu,

[V4]
 Halalango Jesu
 Halalango Jesu 'Nkosi</lyrics>
