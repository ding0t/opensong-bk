<lyrics>[V1]
.A        C        D
 Set this place on fire,
.A         C       D
 Send Your Spirit, Savior;
.A      C        D
 Rescue from the mire,
.A         C       D
 Show Your servant favor.
.D                          C
 Yesterday was the day that I was alone,
.    G                      E7
 Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God.

[C1]
.          A    F       C         G
   Yes our God, He is a consuming fire,
.          A      F         D
   And the flames burn down deep in my soul;
.          A   F       C         G
   Yes our God He is a consuming fire,
.     A         F           D                             A    C DACD
   He reaches inside and He melts down this cold heart of stone.

[B1]
.  Em      G              D                      Am
   Did you realize that inside of you there is a flame?
.  Em      G                  D
   Did you ever try to let it burn
.                      A
   Let it burn, let it burn?</lyrics>
