 Jesus' blo - od can make you free
.D        G         C     G
 For he saved the worst among you

 When He sa - ved a wretch like me

[V4]
 To the faint He giveth power,
 Through the mountains makes a way;
 Findeth water in the desert,
 Turns the night to golden day.

[V5]
 In temptation He is near thee,
 Holds the pow'rs of hell at bay;
 Guides you to the path of safety,
 Gives you grace for every day.

[V6]
 He will keep thee while the ages
 Roll throughout eternity;
 Though earth hinders and hell rages,
 All must work for good to thee.</lyrics>
