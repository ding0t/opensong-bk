<lyrics>[V1]
.E  F#m    E   A
  I have a Maker
.E   B
  He formed my heart
.E F#m       E     A
 Before even time began
.   E        B      E
 My life was in his hands

[C1]
.  A   E        B   E
    He knows my name
.  A   E        B      E
    He knows my every thought
.  A   E         B         C#m
    He sees each tear that falls
.     A        B      E   A
   He hears me when I call

[V2]
.E  F#m    G#m   A
  I have a Father
.E                B
  He calls me His own
.E      F#m   E     A
  He'll never leave me
.   E      B       E
 No matter where I go</lyrics>
