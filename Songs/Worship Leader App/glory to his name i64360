<lyrics>[V1]
 Down at the cross
 Where my Savior died,
 Down where for cleansing
 From sin I cried;
 There to my heart
 Was the blood applied;
 Glory to His name!

[C1]
   Glory to His name!
   Glory to His name!
   There to my heart
   Was the blood applied;
   Glory to His name!

[V2]
 I am so wondrously
 Saved from sin,
 Jesus so sweetly
 Abides within,
 There at the cross
 Where He took me in;
 Glory to His name!

[V3]
 Oh, precious fountain
 That saves from sin!
 I am so glad I have entered in;
 There Jesus saves me
 And keeps me clean;
 Glory to His name!

[V4]
 Come to this fountain
 So rich and sweet;
 Cast thy poor soul
 At the Savior's feet;
 Plunge in today
 And be made complete;
 Glory to His name!</lyrics>
