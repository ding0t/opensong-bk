<lyrics>[V1]
.  Em
 Strip me back
.    C
 Of all my pride
.    G       D
 My possesions
.     Em
 Till all I want
.    C
 And all I seek
.         G     D
 Is Your presence

[P1]
.           C
   Awake in me
.               Em
   A fire and a zeal
.                  D
   A fire full of love
.               C
   Heaven open up

[C1]
.   G
   Come and fill this place
.              D
   With Your mercy with Your grace
.         Em            C
   Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
.        G
   With power and with Love
.          D
   All consuming fire come
.         Em            C
   Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit

[B1]
.  G
   We want more of Your presence
.  D
   We want more of Your power
.  Em
   We want more of Your glory
.  C
   We want to know You</lyrics>
