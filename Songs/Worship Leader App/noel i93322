<lyrics>[V1]
.     G     D
 The first noel
.     C          G
 the angels did say
.         C
 Was to certain poor
. G/B          C         D    G
 shepherds in fields as they lay
.    G            D
 In fields where they
.     C             G
 lay keeping their sheep
.      C             G/B        C  D   G
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[C1]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[V2]
.      G      D
 They looked up
.     C     G
 and saw a star
.        C      G/B       C   D    G
 Shining in the east, beyond them far
.    G       D
 And to the earth
.     C         G
 it gave great light
.     C        G/B         C   D   G
 And so it continued both day and night

[C2]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[V3]
.    G         D
 And by the light
.    C        G
 Of that same star
.      C        G/B           C   D    G
 Three wise men came from the country far;
.   G          D
 To seek for a King
.    C       G
 Was their intent,
.       C          G/B       C   D    G
 And to follow the star wherever it went.

[C3]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[V4]
.     G    D
 This star drew nigh
.    C        G
 To the north-west;
.     C     G/B     C    D  G
 O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
.    G        D
 And there it did
.     C        G
 Both stop and stay,
.      C        G/B         C D  G
 Right over the place where Jesus lay.

[C4]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[V5]
.     G       D
 Then entered in
.      C        G
 Those wise men three,
.     C      G/B  C    D     G
 Fell reverently upon their knee,
.    G       D
 And offered there
.       C  G
 In his presence
.      C        G/B       C   D    G
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

[C5]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[V6]
.     G      D
 Then let us all
.     C   G
 With one accord
.     C       G/B      C   D    G
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
.     G    D
 That hath made heav'n
.    C        G
 And earth of nought,
.    C        G/B       C   D    G
 And with his blood mankind has bought.

[C6]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
   Born is the King of Israel

[C7]
.  G     D      C     G
   Noel, noel, noel, noel
.  C            G/B    C D G
