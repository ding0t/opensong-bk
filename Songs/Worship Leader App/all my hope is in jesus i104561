<lyrics>[V1]
 I've been held by the Saviour
 I've felt fire from above
 I've been down to the river
 I ain't the same, a prodigal returned

[C1]
   All my hope is in Jesus
   Thank God that yesterday's gone
   And all my sins are forgiven
   And I've been washed by the blood

[V2]
 I'm no stranger to the prison
 I've worn shackles and chains
 But I've been freed and forgiven
 I'm not going back, I'll never be the same</lyrics>
