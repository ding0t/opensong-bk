.    G
 The splendor of the King,

 Clothed in majesty,

 Let all the earth rejoice,

 All the earth rejoice.
.   G
 He wraps Himself in light,
.    Em
 And darkness tries to hide
.                    C
 And trembles at His voice,
.                D
 Trembles at His voice.

[C1]

   How great is our God, sing with me,
.      Em
   How great is our God, all will see

   How great, how great is our God.

 Age to age He stands,
.    Em
 And time is in His hands,
.                  C
 Beginning and the end,
.                  D
 Beginning and the end.
.    G
 The Godhead, three in one
.Em
 Father Spirit Son.
.                 C
 The Lion and the Lamb,
.                 D
 The Lion and the Lamb.

   Name above all names,
.  Em
   Worthy of all praise,

   My heart will sing

   How great is our God.</lyrics>
