 You said that when we ask we will receive
 We take You at Your Word, so Lord we're asking
 You said Your people will do greater things
 We believe it, we believe

[C1]
   We will see miracles
   We will see giants fall
   We'll walk on water
   This is Your Kingdom come
   This is the battle won
   This is revival
   We will see miracles

[V2]
 You said that
 Nothing is impossible
 We won't back down we know that You are able
 You said Your people will do greater things
 We believe it, we believe

[B1]
   The whole earth will be filled
   With the glory of the Lord
   Like the waters cover the sea

[B2]
   We will see Your glory
   We will see Your glory
   We will see Your glory here</lyrics>
