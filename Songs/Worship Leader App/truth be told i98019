<lyrics>[V1]
.B           B/A#           G#m      B/F#      Emaj7
  Lie number one you're supposed to have it all together
.               B            B/A#
 And when they ask how you're doing
.     G#m              B/A#         Emaj7
 Just smile and tell them, &quot;Never better&quot;

[V2]
.B            B/A#           G#m      B/F#      Emaj7
 Lie number 2 everybody's life is perfect except yours
.              B              F#
 So keep your messes and your wounds
.          G#m               F#          E         F#
 And your secrets safe with you behind closed doors

[V3]
.E         F#
  Truth be told
.     G#m     B/D#     E
 The truth is rarely told, now

[V4]
.           B              F#/A#         G#m           F#           E
 I say I'm fine, yeah I'm fine oh I'm fine, hey I'm fine but I'm not
.     F#
 I'm broken
.B              F#            G#m           F#/A           E
 And when it's out of control I say it's under control but it's not
.         F#
 And you know it
.   E                               F#
 I don't know why it's so hard to admit it
.            G#m          F#           E
 When being honest is the only way to fix it
.            B          F#/A#
 There's no failure, no fall
.           G#m           F#       E
 There's no sin you don't already know
.            F#      B   F# G#m F# E F#
 So let the truth be told

[V5]
 There's a sign on the door, says, &quot;Come as you are&quot; but I doubt it
 'Cause if we lived like it was true, every Sunday morning pew would be crowded

[V6]
 But didn't you say the church should look more like a hospital
 A safe place for the sick, the sinner and the scarred and the prodigals
 Like me
.                   F#            G#m
     Can I really stand here unashamed
.                       B                 E
     Knowin' that Your love for me won't change?
.               F#
     Oh God if that's really true
.          B  F#   G#m  F#  E  F#
     Then let the truth be told</lyrics>
