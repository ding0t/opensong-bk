<lyrics>[V1]
 I just came to praise the Lord
 I just came to praise the Lord
 I just came to praise His Holy Name
 I just came to praise the Lord

[C1]
   He came into my life
   One very special day
   He came into my heart
   To show me a better way
   He said He would never depart
   And this is why I sing:
   I just came to praise the Lord

[V2]
 I just came to thank the Lord
 I just came to thank the Lord
 I just came to praise His Holy Name
 I just came to thank the Lord

[V3]
 I just came to love the Lord
 I just came to love the Lord
 I just came to praise His Holy ame
 I just came to love the Lord</lyrics>
