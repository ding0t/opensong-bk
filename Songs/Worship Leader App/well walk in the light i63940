<title>We'll walk in the light</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 All ye saints of light proclaim,
 Jesus, the light of the world;
 Life and mercy in His name,
 Jesus, the light of the world.

[C1]
   We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,
   Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright;
   Shine all around us by day and by night,
   Jesus, the light of the world.

[V2]
 Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
 Jesus, the light of the world;
 Send the Gospel truth to all,
 Jesus, the light of the world.

[V3]
 Why not seek Him then today,
 Jesus, the light of the world;
 Go with truth the narrow way,
 Jesus, the light of the world.

[V4]
 Come, confess Him as your King,
 Jesus, the light of the world;
 Then the bells of heaven will ring,
 Jesus, the light of the world.</lyrics>
