<lyrics>[C1]
   Trust in the Lord with all your heart and not on your own understanding
   In all of your ways acknowledge Him and He will keep your path straight
   Don´t worry about tomorrow He´s got it under control
   Just trust in the Lord with all your heart and He will carry you through

[V1]
 Lord sometimes it gets so tough To keep my eyes on you when things are going wrong
 Then I turn my eyes up to the sky and I hear your voice
 It says to me</lyrics>
