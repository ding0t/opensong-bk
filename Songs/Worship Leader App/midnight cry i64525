<lyrics>[V1]
 Saints of all the ages that's gone by,
 Longed to see this happ'ning in their time,
 But they died in faith anticipating for the day,
 Which is GOING ON now,
 In this finishing hour.

[V2]
 Chorus
 There was a midnight cry:
 The Bridegroom's drawing nigh!
 There will be a rapture
 In the twinkling of an eye.
 Come, trim the lamp of your heart now,
 Let the Love of Christ shine bright in you
 Let His Life in you abide -
 Jesus Christ is revealed in His Bride.

[V3]
 Darkness holds the world in deadly grip,
 People's hearts are in religious sleep,
 But there's a holy and elected nation pure and
 right,
 For the harvest is ripe,
 Fields are ready and white.

[V4]
 The glorious and spotless, sinless Bride
 Ready to be standing by His side
 She is given the fine linen of righteousness of
 saints,
 The perfection of Christ
 Can be seen in their lives.

[V5]
 How we cherish the Message from God!
 Let us sing a new song to the Lord
 It's a sign to all the nations
 The Divine manifestation,
 For we have a revelation - who we are.</lyrics>
