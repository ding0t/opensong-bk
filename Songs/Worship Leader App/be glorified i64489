<lyrics>[V1]
 Now God our father, You are the father,
 We are the works of Your hands.
 Mold us and make us, make us like Jesus,
 We are the works of your hands.

[V2]
 Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us.
 Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us.

[V3]
 God of creation, in celebration,
 Praising the God of our lives.
 Blessing the nation, Master creator,
 Praising the God of our lives.

[V4]
 // Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us.
 Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us. //

[V5]
 Yours is the kingdom, the power the glory,
 The first hallelujah, the final amen.
 And I was created to praise you forever,
 Created to praise you again, and again.

[V6]
 And everything within my soul,
 gives glory to Your name.
 To Jesus Christ who was and is,
 And is coming again to reign.

[V7]
 Yours is the kingdom, the power the glory,
 The first hallelujah, the final amen.
 And I was created to praise you forever,
 Created to praise you again, and again.

[V8]
 // Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us.
 Be glorified, God of our lives, be glorified in us. //</lyrics>
