<lyrics>[V1]
 Sometimes I wonder, is He faithful?
 Does He see me in my trouble?
 Does He understand?
 Sometimes I question if He's able
 Can He rescue, can He save me
 Again and again?

[P1]
   But when I look back

[C1]
   Did He move every mountain?
   Did He part every sea?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can,
   Did He defeat the darkness?
   Did He deliver me?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can

[V2]
 Cause sometimes those voices try to tell me
 I'm forgotten, and I've fallen
 Too far from His hands
 But I know what kind of God He is
 And I'm trusting in His promises
 I'm believing and I'm singing
 Yes, He can

[C2]
   Did He move every mountain?
   Did He part every sea?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can,
   Did He defeat the darkness?
   Did He deliver me?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can

[B1]
   'Cause I've seen too much, now I can't deny
   He's come through every single time
   From the beginning until the end
   He did, He will, He can

[C3]
   Did He move every mountain?
   Did He part every sea?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can,
   Did He defeat the darkness?
   Did He deliver me?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can
   Did He move every mountain?
   Did He part every sea?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can,
   Did He defeat the darkness?
   Did He deliver me?
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can
   Yes, He did
   So yes, He can</lyrics>
