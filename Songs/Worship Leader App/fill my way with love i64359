<lyrics>[V1]
 Let me walk, blessed Lord,
 in the way Thou hast gone,
 Leading straight to the land above;
 Giving cheer everywhere,
 to the sad and the lone,
 Fill my way every day with love.

[V2]
 CHORUS
 Fill my way every day with love,
 As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
 Let me go all the while, with
 a song and a smile,
 Fill my way every day with love.

[V3]
 Keep me close to the side of
 my Saviour and Guide,
 Let me never in darkness rove;
 Keep my path free from wrath,
 and my soul satisfied,
 Fill my way every day with love.

[V4]
 Soon the race will be o'er, and
 I'll travel no more,
 But abide in my home above;
 Let me sing, blessed King,
 all the way to the shore,
 Fill my way every day with love.</lyrics>
