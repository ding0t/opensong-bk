<lyrics>[V1]
.        Em.          C
 Let it rain, let it rain.
.  G.                      D
 Open the floodgates of Heaven.

[V2]
.Em
 We feel the rains of Your Love,
.C
 We feel the winds of Your Spirit,
.               G
 And now the heartbeat of Heaven,
.         D
 Let us hear.

[V3]
 Because we want to see You;
 Show us Your Glory.
 And we want to know You, Lord.</lyrics>
