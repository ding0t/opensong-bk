<lyrics>[V1]
 He's got it all in control
 He's got it all in control
 He's put that reassurance
 Way down in my soul
 He's got it all in control

[V2]
 I've put my life in His hands
 I've put my life in His hands
 So every road I walk down
 I'm sure is in His plan
 'Cause I've put my life in His hands</lyrics>
