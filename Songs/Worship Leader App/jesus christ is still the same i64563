<lyrics>[V1]
 God Sent To Us His mighty Prophet
 With the Spoken Word
 The Pillar of Fire has descended
 And vindicated His own Word

[C1]
   Chorus
   Jesus Christ is still the same
   Yesterday, eternally
   Just believe and you shall see Him
   Jesus is the same today

[V2]
 God leads His Children out of Babel
 As He did so long time ago
 Oh Come ye out of Her My People!
 Obey the Word of this last hour!

[V3]
 Hear the cry of God's Eagle
 Oh! You My People be prepared
 The Lord is now in His Coming
 Soon we shall meet Him in the air</lyrics>
