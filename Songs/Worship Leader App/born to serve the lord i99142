<lyrics>[V1]
 From the dust of the earth
 my God created man-
 His breath made man a living soul;
 And God so loved the world
 He gave His only Son,
 and that is why I love Him so!

[V2]
 My hands were made
 to help my neighbor,
 my eyes were made
 to read God's word.
 My feet were made
 to walk in His footsteps,
 my body is the temple of the Lord.

[C1]
   I was made in His likeness,
   created in his image,
   for I was born to serve the Lord.
   And I cannot deny Him,
   I will always walk beside Him,
   for I was born to the serve the Lord.</lyrics>
