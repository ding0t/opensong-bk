<title>Like The Woman</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Like the woman
 With the issue of blood
 We press in, we press in
 Like the blind man
 Waiting patiently
 We press in
 Through the crowd

[C1]
   Then suddenly
   A touch from heaven
   Jesus came and rescued me
   Then suddenly
   A touch from heaven
   Jesus came and set me free</lyrics>
