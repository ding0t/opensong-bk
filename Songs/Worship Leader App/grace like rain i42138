<lyrics>[V1]
. C#m    A          E         B
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
.     C#m     A           E  B
 That saved a wretch like me.
.  C#m      A        E       B
 I once was lost but now I'm found;
.    C#m       A     E   B
 Was blind but now I see.

[C1]
.  C#m   A                 E
    Hallelujah, grace like rain
.        B
   falls down on me.
.  C#m   A             E
    Hallelujah, all my stains
.              B
   are washed away.
.  C#m   A                 E
    Hallelujah, grace like rain
.        B
   falls down on me.
.  C#m   A             E
    Hallelujah, all my stains are
.          B            C#m AEB
   washed away, washed away.

[V2]
.      C#m        A         E        B
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
.    C#m      A       E      B
 And grace my fears relieved.
.    C#m      A        E       B
 How precious did that grace appear
.    C#m    A       E      B
 The hour I first believed.

[V3]
.     C#m        A         E        B
 When we've been there ten thousand years,
.       C#m     A      E   B
 Bright shining as the sun,
.      C#m     A       E         B
 We've no less days to sing Your praise
.     C#m     A       E   B
 Than when we first begun.</lyrics>
