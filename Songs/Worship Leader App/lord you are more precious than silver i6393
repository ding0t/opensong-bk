.D         A        G             D
 Lord, You are more precious than silver.
.          A        G           A
 Lord, You are more costly than gold.
.D         A        G              D
 Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds.
.G                A                  D
 Nothing that I desire compares with you.

[B1]

   Nothing that I desire compares with you.</lyrics>
