<title>All to Him</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 For every mountain that is high
 He is higher
 For every burden that is great
 He is greater
 For every valley that is deep
 He is deeper still
 More than we can know

[C1]
   Our promise is Jesus
   Our answer is Jesus
   All to Him, All to Him
   we owe everything
   Our savior is Jesus
   Our future is Jesus
   All to Him, All to Him
   we owe everything

[V2]
 For every fear that closes in
 He is closer
 For every doubt that comes on strong
 He is stronger
 For every battle that we face
 He has conquered all
 More than we can know

[B1]
   We know the great God
   We serve the great God
   We owe the great God
   Everything all to Him</lyrics>
