 Make me a channel of your peace.
 Where there is hatred let me bring your love.
 Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord
 And where there's doubt, true faith in you.

[V2]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope
 Where there is darkness, only light
 And where there's sadness, ever joy.

[V3]
 Oh, Master grant that I may never seek
 So much to be consoled as to console
 To be understood as to understand
 To be loved as to love with all my soul.

[V4]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
 In giving to all men that we receive
 And in dying that we're born to eternal life.

[V5]
 Oh, Master grant that I may never seek
 So much to be consoled as to console
 To be understood as to understand
 To be loved as to love with all my soul.

[V6]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
 In giving to all men that we receive
 And in dying that we're born to eternal life.</lyrics>
