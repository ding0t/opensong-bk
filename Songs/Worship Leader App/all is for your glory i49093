<lyrics>[V1]
.Hm
 There's just one chief end to man's purpose
.Hm
 One main reason for existence
.Hm
 All man's vain and high ambitions
.       Hm                                D            Hm D
 Will one day be brought low will one day be brought low__

[V2]
 To treasure You above all others
 To love You like we love no other
 Your greatness soon will be uncovered
 Will one day be brought low will one day be brought low

[P1]
.         Em               D/F#             Asus A
   For You alone will be exalted in that day
.  Em                          D                          A
   Worthless goals will be exposed as idols that we've made
.         Em              D/F#              Asus-A
   For You alone will be exalted in that day
.  Em                          D                         A
   You'll be seen as rightful King and from our hearts we'll say

[C1]

   That in all things You may have the first place
.              G/H                            D/A
   That in all things You may have preeminence
