<lyrics>[V1]
 It's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.
 It's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.

[V2]
 Not my brother or my sister, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.
 Not my brother or my sister, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.

[V3]
 Not my mother or my father, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.
 Not my mother or my father, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.

[V4]
 Not my stranger or my neighbour, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.
 Not my stranger or my neighbour, but it's me, O Lord,
 Standin' in the need of prayer.</lyrics>
