 You are not a God
 Created by human hands
 You are not a god
 Dependent on any mortal man
 You are not a god
 In need of anything we can give
 By Your plan, that's just the way it is

[C1]
   Chorus:
   You are God alone
   From before time began
   You were on Your throne
   You are God alone
   And right now In the good times and bad
   You are on Your throne
   You are God alone

[V2]
 You're the only God whose power
 none can contend
 You're the only God
 Whose name and praise will never end
 You're the only God
 Who's worthy of everything we can give
 You are God
 And that's just the way it is

[B1]
   Unchangeable
   Unshakable
   Unstoppable
   That's what You are (2x)</lyrics>
