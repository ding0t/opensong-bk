 O daughters of Zion
 O Abraham's sons
 Hear the words of your Father
 Hear His promise of love
 I will make you a blessing
 So count the stars if you can
 You will be a great nation
 I will give you this land

[C1]
   I will bring you back home
   I'll bring you back home, oh my children
   You will no longer roam
   Lost and alone in the night
   There is nothing on earth that could take you away
   Once I gather you under my wings
   I will bring you all back home again

[V2]
 Though you've wandered like strangers
 To the ends of the earth
 I will send you a savior
 I will finish my work
 You have no other shepherd
 You have no other lord
 Green pastures are waiting in Zion once more

[C2]
   I will bring you back home
   I'll bring you back home, oh my children
   You will no longer roam
   Lost and alone in the night
   There is nothing on earth that could take you away
   Once I gather you under my wings
   I will bring you all back home

[B1]
   So we pray for the peace
   But look to the East
   For the Sun rises sudden and fierce
   Every prophet and priest and king in the City
   Will look on the One they have pierced
   We will mourn for the One we have pierced

[V3]
 But don't fear o my daughters
 Or sons of Abraham
 I will wash you with water
 I will offer the Lamb
 Though your sins were like scarlet
 They'll be whiter than snow
 I have always been with you
 I will never let go

[C3]
   I will bring you back home
   I'll bring you back home, oh my children
   You will no longer roam
   Lost and alone in the night
   There is nothing on earth that could take you away
   I will gather you under my wings
   I will bring you all back home
   Oh I will bring you all back home again

[V4]
