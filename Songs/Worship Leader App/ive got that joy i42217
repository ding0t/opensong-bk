<lyrics>[V1]
.              A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  E
 Down in my heart, down in my heart.
.       A
 Where? Down in my heart.
.     E        A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  Bm         E7       A  A7
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay.

[C1]
.             D              A
   And I'm so happy, so very happy
.       E                           A    A7
   I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.
.             D              A
   And I'm so happy, so very happy

   I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.

[V2]
.               A
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
.                   E
 Down in my heart, down in my heart.
.       A
 Where? Down in my heart.
.     E        A
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
.                  Bm         E7       A A7
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay.</lyrics>
