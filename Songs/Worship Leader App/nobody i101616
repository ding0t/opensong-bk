 Verse 1
.             Em
 Why You ever chose me
.    C             G
 Has always been a mystery
.       Em
 All my life, I've been told I belong
.       C          G
 At the end of the line
.                   Em
 With all the other Not-Quites
.     C             G
 With all the Never-Get-It-Rights
.       Em
 But it turns out they're the ones You were looking for
.C        G
 All this time

[V2]
 Chorus
.                  Em     C              G
 'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
.          Em           C        G
 All about Somebody who saved my soul
.               Em              C               G
 Ever since You rescued me, You gave my heart a song to sing
.                   C        G              D Em
 I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

 I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

 Verse 2
.          Em
 Moses had stage fright
.    C               G
 And David brought a rock to a sword fight
.           Em
 You picked twelve outsiders nobody would've chosen
.        C           G
 And You changed the world
.                       Em
 Well, the moral of the story is
.     C            G
 Everybody's got a purpose
.          Em
 So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
.     C                G
 &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; I'll say...

 Chorus

[V5]
 Bridge
.             G                   C
 So let me go down, down, down in history
.           G                                   D
 As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
.            Em                               A
 And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
.                   C        G              D G
 I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
.             G                   C
 So let me go down, down, down in history (Go down in history)
.           G                                   D
 As another blood-bought faithful member of the family (It's all I ever wanna be)
.            Em                               A
 And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
.
