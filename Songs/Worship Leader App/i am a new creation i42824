<lyrics>[V1]
 I Am a New Creation,
 No more in Condemnation,
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.

[V2]
 My Heart is Overflowing,
 My Love just keeps on Growing,
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.

[V3]
 And I will Praise You, Lord,
 Yes, I will Praise You, Lord,
 And I will Sing of all that You have done.

[V4]
 A Joy that knows no limit,
 A Lightness in My Spirit
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.

[V5]
 And I will Praise You, Lord,

[V6]
 Yes, I will Praise You, Lord,
 And I will Sing of all that You have done.
 A Joy that knows no limit,
 A Lightness in My Spirit
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.
 Here in the Grace of God, I stand.</lyrics>
