<lyrics>[V1]
 When I saw the cleansing fountain
 Open wide for all my sin,
 I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
 When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

[C1]
   CHORUS
   I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
   Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
   Give Him glory, all ye people,
   For His blood has washed away
   each stain.

[V2]
 Though the way seems straight
 and narrow,
 All I claimed was swept away;
 My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
 At my feet in ashes lay.

[V3]
 Then God's fire upon the altar
 Of my heart was set aflame;
 I shall never cease to praise Him,
 Glory, glory to His name!

[V4]
 Blessed be the name of Jesus!
 I'm so glad He took me in;
 He's forgiven my transgressions,
 He has cleansed my heart from sin.</lyrics>
