<lyrics>[C1]
   Jesus you are my salvation
   Jesus you are my way home
   I long to live forever
   Where you are on your mighty throne

[V1]
 When it´s my time to leave this world behind me
 When it´s my time to spread my wings
 Lord I want to be found worthy
 Because it´s your face that I long to see

[V2]
 I remember my sad days of sorrow
 I remember being down on my knees
 Then you touched me and my eyes were opened
 And now it´s your face that I long to see.</lyrics>
