<lyrics>[V1]
 My God is awesome,
 He can move mountains
 Keep me in the valley,
 hide me from the rain
 My God is awesome,
 heals me when I'm broken
 Strength where I've been weakened,
 forever He will reign

[C1]
   My God is awesome, awesome,
   awesome, awesome
   My God is awesome, awesome,
   awesome, awesome

[V2]
 My God is awesome,
 Savior of the whole world
 Giver of salvation,
 by His stripes I am healed
 My God is awesome,
 today I am forgiven
 His grace is why I'm living,
 praise His holy Name

[C2]
   He's mighty, He's mighty,
   He's mighty, He's mighty,
   Awesome, Awesome

[C3]
   He's Holy, He's Holy,
   He's Holy, He's Holy,
   Awesome, Awesome

[C4]
   He's Great, He's Great,
   He's Great, He's Great,
   Awesome, Awesome

[C5]
   Deliverer, Deliverer,
   Deliverer, Deliverer,
   Awesome, Awesome
