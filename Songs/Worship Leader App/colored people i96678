 Intro:
 D A G

[V2]
 Verse 1:
.Bm      G         Em
 Pardon me, your epidermis is showing, mister
.Bm           G                 Em
 I couldn't help but note your shade of melanin
.Bm        G         Em
 I tip my hat to the colorful arrangement
.Bm                G            Em
 Cause I see the beauty in the tones of our skin

[V3]
 Pre-Chorus:
.Cadd9              G                     A
 We've gotta come together and thank the maker of us all

[V4]
 Chorus:
.D                             A          G
 We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place
.D                                A           G
 We're colored people, and they call us the human race
.D                       A          G
 We've got a history so full of mistakes
.           D                    A          G     D  A D A D
 And we are colored people who depend on a Holy Grace

[V5]
 Verse 2:
.Bm           G        Em
 A piece of canvas is only the beginning
.Bm            G             Em
 It takes on character with every loving stroke
.Bm              G             Em
 This thing of beauty is the passion of an artist's heart
.Bm          G        Em
 By God's design, we are a skin kaleidoscope

[V6]
 (Pre-Chorus)

[V7]
 (Chorus)

[V8]
 Bridge:
.Bm
 Ignorance has wronged some races
.Bm
 And vengeance is the Lord's
.Bm
 If we aspire to share this space
.Em                    C A
 Repentance is the cure

[V9]
 Interlude:
 D A G

[V10]
 Rap:
.D
 Well, just a day in the shoes of a color blind man
.                A               G
 Should make it easy for you to see
.D
 That these diverse tones do more than cover our bones
.      A               G
 As a part of our anatomy</lyrics>
