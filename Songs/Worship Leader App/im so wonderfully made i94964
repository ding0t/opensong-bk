<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm so wonderfully made. (I am?)
 You're so wonderfully made. (You are!)
 God has made us in a special way,
 And we're so wonderfully made.

[V2]
 I can blink my eyes (Blink, blink!)
 And I can jump so high (Whee!)
 'Cause I'm so wonderfully,
 You're so wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully made.

[V3]
 I can clap my hands for you (Clap, clap)
 I can sneeze my nose, Ah-choo (AH-CHOO!)
 'Cause I'm so wonderfully,
 You're so wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully made.

[V4]
 Even when you could not see me
 Before the day that I was born,
 I was so wonderfully,
 You were so wonderfully,
 We were so wonderfully made.

[V5]
 I can stomp my feet (Stomp, stomp!)
 Touch my head, touch my belly, touch the street (Slap, slap!)
 'Cause I'm so wonderfully,
 You're so wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully made.

[V6]
 I can shout, &quot;Yahoo!&quot; (YAHOO!)
 'Cause God loves me and you (That's true!)
 'Cause I'm so wonderfully,
 You're so wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully made.

[V7]
 Even when you could not see me
 Before the day that I was born,
 I was so wonderfully,
 You were so wonderfully,
 We were so wonderfully made.

[V8]
 I'm so wonderfully made.
 You're so wonderfully made.
 God has made us in a special way,
 And we're so wonderfully made.

[V9]
 I'm so wonderfully,
 You're so wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully,
 Wonderfully, wonderfully,
 We're so wonderfully made.
 (HOORAY!)</lyrics>
