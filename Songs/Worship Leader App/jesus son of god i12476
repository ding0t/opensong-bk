<title>Jesus Son Of God</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You came down, from heaven's throne
 This earth You formed, was not Your home
 A love like this, the world had never known
 A crown of thorns, to mock your name
 Forgiveness fell upon Your face
 A love like this, the world had never known

[C1]
   On the altar of our praise
   Let there be no higher name
   Jesus Son of God
   You laid down Your perfect life
   You are the sacrifice
   Jesus Son of God
   You are Jesus Son of God

[V2]
 You took our sin
 You bore our shame
 You rose to life
 You defeated the grave
 A love like this, the world has never known

[B1]
   Be lifted higher
   Than all You've overcome
   Your name be louder
   Than any other song
   There is no power
   That can come against Your love
   The cross was enough
   The cross was enough</lyrics>
