 In Your presence there is joy
 In Your presence there is freedom
 But the greatest joy of all
 Is to know we′ve made You smile
 In Your presence there is life
 In Your presence there is healing
 But the greatest joy of all
 Is to know we've reached Your heart

[V2]
 God of glory we give You praise
 (We) lift You up in this holy place
 Our hearts are ready
 Our lives made new
 It′s all we long to do
 God of glory we give You praise
 (We) lift You up in this holy place
 Our hearts are ready
 Our lives made new
 God of glory we worship You</lyrics>
