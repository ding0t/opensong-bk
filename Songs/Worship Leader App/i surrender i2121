.Am                   C
 Here I am down on my knees again
.             G                 F
 Surrendering all, surrendering all

[V2]
.Am                        C
 Find me here, Lord as You draw me near
.              G                  F
 Desperate for You, Desperate for You

[C1]
.  Am           C
   I surrender, I surrender
.            Dm                       F
   I want to know You more, I want to know You more

[V3]
.Am                           C
 Drench my soul, as mercy and grace unfold
.             G                   F
 I hunger and thirst I hunger and thirst

[V4]
.     Am                              C
 With arms stretched wide, I know You hear my cry
.            G                F
 Speak to me now, Speak to me now

[B1]
.         F       C              F       G                  Dm                  Am     G
   Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathe within Lord have Your way, Lord have Your way in me
.         F      C              F        G
   Like a mighty storm, Stir within my soul
.                 Dm                  Am     G
   Lord have Your way, Lord have Your way in me</lyrics>
