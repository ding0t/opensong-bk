 Upon the cross, our Savior hung
 Bearing all our sin and shame
 But on the third day, He arose with victory
 Defeating death and taking away our blame taking away our blame

[V2]
 Chorus:
 Jesus rose from the cross
 He conquered death and paid the cost
 Our salvation is found in Him alone
 Jesus rose from the cross, His love shown yes his love is shown

[V3]
 Verse 2:
 The stone was rolled away, an empty tomb revealed
 Proving that He is alive forevermore
 His grace and mercy freely given to all who believe
 In His name we find hope, peace and so much more

[V4]
 Chorus:
 Jesus rose from the cross
 He conquered death and paid the cost
 Our salvation is found in Him alone
 Jesus rose from the cross, His love shown yes his love is shown

[V5]
 Bridge:
 Oh what a Savior we serve
 Who took upon Himself our sin
 Now we can live in freedom eternal life
 For Jesus has risen again

[V6]
 Chorus:
 Jesus rose from the cross
 He conquered death and paid the cost
 Our salvation is found in Him alone
 Jesus rose from the cross, His love shown

[V7]

 Let us lift high His name
 Praise be to God for sending His Son
 Forever grateful for what He's done
 We will worship Him till eternity has begun.</lyrics>
