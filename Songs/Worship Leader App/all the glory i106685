<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 While walking on this earth,
 We are nothing in ourselves,
 Yet God's chosen to use us
 In His mighty hand;
 For the Master's plan requires
 human instruments;
 But they must not ever glorify
 themselves.

[V2]
 All the glory must be to the Lord,
 Only He is worthy of our praise.
 No one on earth should give glory
 to himself;
 For all the glory must be to the
 Lord.

[V3]
 Are we ready to obey Him
 When He urges us to go?
 Are we willing to be nothing
 but servants of the cross?
 In the times of trial and hardship,
 Or when shining from the top,
 Are we willing to lay down our lives
 for Him?</lyrics>
