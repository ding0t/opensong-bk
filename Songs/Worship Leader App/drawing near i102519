<lyrics>[V1]
 // Drawing near to you God
 We bow humbly before you
 We repent of all our sins
 As we seek your face //

[V2]
 Would you hear us Lord, and forgive each one of us
 Would you hear us Lord and bring healing to our land

[V3]
 Let your peace fill this place
 Let your love be poured out
 Let your mercy flow freely in our land
 May your gospel be heard
 May each heart turn to you
 May your name be exalted in our land

[V4]
 // Do this for your sake our Lord
 As we cry out in your name
 Not on account of us oh God
 but because of your great love //</lyrics>
