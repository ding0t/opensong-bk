<lyrics>[V1]
.G    Em       G        Am     D
 I am weak but Thou art strong;
.D                  Dsus G
 Jesus keep me from all  wrong.
.G       Em           C2
 I'll be satisfied as long
.     G            D          Dsus G
 As I walk, let me walk close to   Thee.

[C1]
.  G      Em     G         Am   D
   Just a closer walk with Thee,
.  D                   Dsus G
   Grant it, Jesus, is my   plea.
.  G     Em               C2
   Daily walking close to Thee,
.         G        D         Dsus G
   Let it be, dear Lord, let it   be.

[V2]
.G          Em       G        Am     D
 Thro' this world of toil and snares,
.D                  Dsus G
 If I faulter, Lord who  cares?
.G        Em           C2
 Who with me my burden shares?
.         G          D          Dsus G
 None but Thee, dear Lord, none but  Thee.

[V3]
.G         Em     G       Am   D
 When this feeble life is o'er,
.D                   Dsus G
 Time for me will be no   more;
.G        Em             C2
 Guide me gently, safely o'er
.       G       D         Dsus G
 To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy  shore.</lyrics>
