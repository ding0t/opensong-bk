<lyrics>[V1]
 From the highest throne
 To the earth below, You laid down Your life
 For the likes of us
 Great is the love of the Saviour

[V2]
 From the wounded heart
 To a life made whole, Every human heart
 Will declare as one
 Great is the love of the Saviour

[C1]
   Lord of endless light
   Let Your glory shine forever
   All the earth All the earth
   Sing Your Praise

[V3]
 From the mountain heights
 To the valleys low All created things
 Given life to show
 Jesus we live for Your glory

[V4]
 From the rising sun
 To the still of night Every waking moment
 For Your delight
 Jesus we live for Your glory

[C2]
   Lord of endless light
   Let Your glory shine forever
   All the earth All the earth
   Sing Your Praise
   Hope of every heart
   Let Your name be lifted higher
   All our hearts All our hearts
   Sing Your Praise

[B1]
   God be exalted, God be exalted
   In everything
   We live for Your glory
   Live for Your glory</lyrics>
