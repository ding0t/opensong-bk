 Well, I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me (x3)
 I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me

[V2]
 You know
 He's under my feet (x6)
 Satan is under my feet

[V3]
 I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me (x3)
 I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me

[V4]
 You know
 He's under my feet (x6)
 Satan is under my feet
 I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me (x3)
 I went to the enemy's camp and
 I took back what he stole from me

[V5]
 You know
 He's under my feet (x6)
 Satan is under my feet</lyrics>
