<lyrics>[V1]
 Mine eyes have seen the glory
 of the coming of the Lord;
 He is trampling out the vintage
 Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
 He hath loosed the fateful lightning
 of His terrible swift sword;
 His truth is marching on.

[C1]
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   His Truth is marching on.

[V2]
 I have seen Him in the watchfires
 of a hundred circling camps;
 They have builded Him an altar
 in the evening dews and damps;
 I can read His righteous sentence
 by the dim and flaring lamps;
 His day is marching on.

[V3]
 He has sounded forth the trumpet
 that shall never sound retreat;
 He is sifting out the hearts of men
 before His judgment seat;
 Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
 be jubilant, my feet!
 Our God is marching on.

[V4]
 In the beauty of the lilies
 Christ was born across the sea,
 With a glory in His bosom
 that transfigures you and me;
 As He died to make men holy,
 let us die to make men free;
 While God is marching on.</lyrics>
