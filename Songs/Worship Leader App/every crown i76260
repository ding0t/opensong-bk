<lyrics>[V1]
.       Dm                             Bb
 I have watched how You drove back the sea
.              F             C
 That swallowed up my every fear
.       Dm                            Bb
 I have walked from the shore to the deep
.          F              C
 Through it all You were there

[P1]
.  Bb
   Mighty Redeemer
.  C
   Strong to deliver
.  Dm              C   Bb
   You are the Great I Am

[C1]
.     F
   We crown You with every crown
   For the way You saved us
.   Dm
   Crown You with every crown
   For the way You love us
.  C
   High King of Heaven
.        Bb                 F
   We crown You the Lord of all

[V2]
.       Dm                              Bb
 I have watched how You led through the wild
.            F/A              C
 A cloud by day and fire by night
.        Dm                  Bb
 Guiding me to Your promised land
.       F/A        C
 Every step by my side

[B1]
.      F/A           Bb
   All hail redeemer hail
.      F/A               C
   For You have died for me
.      F/A          Bb      C  Dm
   Your praise will never never fail
.         Bb   C   F
   Through all eternity</lyrics>
