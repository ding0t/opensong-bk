<lyrics>[V1]
 There are two roads you may take
 One by sight, one by faith
 Take the Word of God or what you see,
 What you believe is what will be.

[C1]
   Set your wings to the winds of faith
   You can fly in a higher place.
   Do not struggle, it's by grace.
   Set your wings to the winds of faith

[V2]
 What's your need, what's your cry,
 What's your mountain much too high.
 Speak the Word of God, and by and by,
 It will move or you will fly.

[V3]
 Watch the eagle in the sky,
 He does not struggle, he does not strive.
 For the power that makes him rise,
 is already in the sky.</lyrics>
