<lyrics>[V1]
 The God of Israel is mighty
 The God of Israel knows no defeat
 He leads His people into battle
 Before Him His enemies must flee

[C1]
   Cry out with a shout of victory
   Lift your voice all the earth
   Sing and dance at the triumph of our King
   For He has won the war
   And spoiled the enemy

[V2]
 The God of Israel is our champion
 His right arm has got the victory
 Our praises rise as incense before Him
 He fights for us and routs the enemy</lyrics>
