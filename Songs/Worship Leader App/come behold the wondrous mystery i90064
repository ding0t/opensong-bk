<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 Come, behold the wondrous mystery
 In the dawning of the king
 He the theme of Heaven's praises
 Robed in frail humanity
 In our longing, in our darkness
 Now, the light of life has come
 Look to Christ who condescended
 Took on flesh to ransom us

[V2]
 Come, behold the wondrous mystery
 He is the perfect son of man
 In His living, in His suffering
 Never trace nor stain of sin
 See the true and better Adam
 Come to save the hell-bound man
 Christ, the great and sure fulfilment
 Of the law; in Him, we stand

[V3]
 Come, behold the wondrous mystery
 Christ, the Lord upon the tree
 In the stead of ruined sinners
 Hangs the lamb in victory
 See the price of our redemption
 See the Father's plan unfold
 Bringing many sons to glory
 Grace unmeasured, love untold

[V4]
 Come, behold the wondrous mystery
 Slain by death, the God of life
 But no grave could ever restrain Him
 Praise the Lord, He is alive
 What a foretaste of deliverance
 How unwavering our hope
 Christ in power resurrected
 As we will be when He comes</lyrics>
