<lyrics>[V1]
 God of Jacob, Great I Am
 King of angels, Son of Man
 Voice of many waters
 Song of Heaven's throne
 Louder than the thunder
 Make Your glory known

[C1]
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Roar (roar)
   Roar (roar)
   Roar

[V2]
 Pride of Zion, prophets spoke
 Our Messiah flesh and bone
 You alone are worthy to open up the scroll
 Like a lamb, You suffered,
 but the Lion has arose

[C2]
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar
   Hail, hail Lion of Judah
   Let the Lion roar!
   Roar! (Roar!)
   Roar! (Roar!)
   Roar! (Roar!)

[B1]
   Let it roar, let it roar, let it roar
   Let the Lion roar

[B2]
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way of the Lord
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way of the Lord
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way of the Lord
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way of the Lord
