<lyrics>[V1]
 Falling on my knees in worship
 Giving all I am to seek Your face
 Lord, all I am is Yours

[V2]
 My whole life, I place in your hands
 God of Mercy, humbled, I bow down
 In Your presence, at Your throne

[V3]
 I called, You answered
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are

[V4]
 My whole life, I place in your hands
 God of Mercy, humbled, I bow down
 In Your presence, at Your throne

[V5]
 And I called, You answered
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are

[V6]
 I called, You answered
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are

[V7]
 In my life, be lifted high
 In our world, be lifted high
 In our love, be lifted high (our love, our love)

[V8]
 In my life, be lifted high
 In our world, be lifted high
 In our love, be lifted high

[V9]
 Falling on my knees in worship
 Giving all I am to seek Your face
 Lord, all I am is Yours

[V10]
 My whole life, I place in your hands
 God of Mercy, humbled, I bow down
 In Your presence, at Your throne

[V11]
 I called, You answered
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are

[V12]
 My whole life, I place in your hands
 God of Mercy, humbled, I bow down
 In Your presence, at Your throne

[V13]
 And I called, You answered
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are
 I called, You answered

[V14]
 And You came to my rescue, and I
 Wanna be where You are

[V15]
 In my life, be lifted high
 In our world, be lifted high
 In our love, be lifted high (our love, our love)

[V16]
 In my life, be lifted high
 In our world, be lifted high
 In our love, be lifted high</lyrics>
