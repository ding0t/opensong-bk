<title>Like a fire</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Like a fire shut up in my bones
 I want the world to know You are God
 With a passion burning deep within
 I want the world to know that You live
 Let Your presence come and saturate
 Every part of me make me new
 Let Your Spirit come and move within
 Fill me once again cause I need more
 Jesus I'm desperate for You
 Jesus I'm hungry for You
 Jesus I'm longing for You
 Lord You are all I want
 Let Your presence come and saturate
 Every part of me make me new
 Let Your Spirit come and move within
 Fill me once again cause I need more
 Jesus I'm desperate for You
 Jesus I'm hungry for You
 Jesus I'm longing for You
 Lord You are all I want
 Jesus I'm desperate for You
 Jesus I'm hungry for You
 Jesus I'm longing for You
 Lord You are all I want
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Oh Lord
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Jesus I'm desperate for You
 Jesus I'm hungry for You
 Jesus I'm longing for You
 Lord You are all I want
 Jesus I'm desperate for You
 Jesus I'm hungry for You
 Jesus I'm longing for You
 Lord You are all I want
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Come on Lord
 Come on Lord
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want
 Come like a flood and saturate me now
 You're all I want
 Come like the wind
 And sweep throughout this place
 You're all we want</lyrics>
