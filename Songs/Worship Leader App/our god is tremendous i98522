 When I'm in need, I call on the Lord
 And He hears me, yes, He helps me
 He is faithful and true
 Won't forget His own
 My companion, my best friend
 The only true God, there's no one greater
 A wonderful Savior, Jesus, the Lion of Judah

[C1]
   Our God is Tremendous, His strength never faileth
   He goes through a fire just to save a sinner
   Yes, He is almighty, He sends His angels to guide me
   There is no storm too powerful
   Our God cannot handle
   Our God in simplicity, revealed in you and me
   Came down from His glory and gave us the victory
   The greatest love story

[V2]
 When your in trouble Jehovah Nissi
 The great enforcer, God almighty, will fight your battles
 Oh yes, He will stand for you
 Your victory will come not the way you think it should
 But my great Jehovah just loves the paradox
 Just stay in your position and watch the miraculous
 Come into action</lyrics>
