 1 I've a message from the Lord, Hallelujah!
 The message unto you I'll give.
 'Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!
 It is only that you &quot;look and live.&quot;
 Refrain:
 &quot;Look and live,&quot; my brother, live.
 Look to Jesus now and live.
 'Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!
 It is only that you &quot;look and live.&quot;
 2 I've a message full of love, Hallelujah!
 A message, O my friend, for you.
 'Tis a message from above, Hallelujah!
 Jesus said it, and I know 'tis true. [Refrain]
 3 Life is offered unto you. Hallelujah!
 Eternal life your soul shall have
 If you'll only look to Him. Hallelujah!
 Look to Jesus, who alone can save. [Refrain]
 4 I will tell you how I came, Hallelujah!
 To Jesus when He made me whole:
 'Twas believing on His name, Hallelujah!
 I trusted and He saved my soul. [Refrain]</lyrics>
