 I heard my loving Savior say,
 There's room at the fountain for thee,
 Come, wash the stains of sin away,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V2]
 CHORUS
 Room, room, yes, there is room,
 Room at the fountain for thee;
 Room, room, yes, there is room,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V3]
 I came to Him, my sins confessed,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 When I gave up, my heart was blest,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V4]
 I plunged beneath the crimson tide,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 And now by faith am sanctified,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V5]
 I found the crimson stream I know,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 His blood has washed me white as snow,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V6]
 He cleansed my heart from inbred sin,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 And new He keeps me pure within,
 There's room at the fountain for thee,

[V7]
 I'll praise Him while He gives me breath,
 There was room at the fountain for mc;
 He saved me from an awful death
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V8]
 His blood was shed but once for all,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 Oh, don't reject sweet Mercy's call,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.

[V9]
 We'll sing with all the saints above,
 There was room at the fountain for me;
 And praise Him for redeeming love,
 There's room at the fountain for thee.</lyrics>
