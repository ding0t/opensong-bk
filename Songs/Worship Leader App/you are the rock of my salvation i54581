<lyrics>[V1]
. Am          G      Am     G
 You are the rock of my salvation,
. F             G             Am G
 You are the strength of my life.
. Am          G         Am     G
 You are my hope and my inspiration,
. F       G              Am
 Lord unto You will I cry.

[C1]

   I believe in you, believe in You,
.            F         G       Am
   For Your faithful love to me.
.            F         G     Em       Am
   You have been my help in time of need;
.   F                    E
   Lord, unto You will cleave.</lyrics>
