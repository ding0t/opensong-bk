<lyrics>[V1]
 Let the living water flow o'er my soul
 Let the Holy spirit come and take
 control
 In every situation that has come o'er
 my mind
 All my cares and trials unto you i
 resign.

[C1]
   Father , Father ,Father
   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
   Spirit, Spirit, Spirit

[V2]
 Come down Holy spirit and take
 control
 Hold me in your loving arms and
 make me whole
 Wipe away all doubts and fears and
 take my pride
 Hold me to your love and keep me
 by your side

[C2]
   Father , Father Father
   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
   Spirit, Spirit, Spirit

[V3]
 Give your life to Jesus, let him take
 your soul
 Let him take you in His arms and
 make you whole
 As you give your life to Him He'll
 make you whole
 You will live and reign with him eternally

[C3]
   Father , Father Father
   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
   Spirit, Spirit, Spirit</lyrics>
