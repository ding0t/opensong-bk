<title>Believe the Armour of God</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.    B        G#m        A#
 My hope is anchored in God
.           B           G#m        A#
 And I wil trust in His unfailing love

[P1]
.       C#m          E           F#
   I believe He is bringing new life
.       C#m                   E               F#
   I believe, therefore it's written as if I spoke

[V2]
.         B                    G#m
 I'll proclaim your righteous deed,
.           A#
 yes Yours alone
.             B                 G#m
 Your mighty acts, as sovereign LORD,
.          A#
 I will proclaim

[P2]
.       C#m          E           F#
   I believe He is bringing new life
.       C#m                   E               F#
   I believe, therefore it's written as if I spoke

[B1]
.               B          G#m
   I wear the helmet of salvation
.       C#m     F#
   and feet of peace
.                  B               G#m
   Breastplate of righteousness together
.           C#m      F#
   with the belt of truth
.       A#              A#
   My shield of faith protects me
.      G#m
   My spirit sword fights war
.            C#m
   With the armour of my God
.                F#
   I'm standing strong</lyrics>
