.C            G/B      Am7  C/G
 Search me oh Lord and know me
.F          C      Dm7   G
 Break my heart, change me
.C             G/B  Am7  C/G
 according to Your Word__
.F                    C
 And fill me up with Your Presence
.Em         Am7    F
 until I overflow, so
.G       F      G
 Use me, Lord, use me

[V2]
.       C                      G/B
 Like a Lighthouse that shines at night
.    Am7            G
 A bridge over the water
.    F              C
 A shelter in the desert,
.     Am7/F               G
 The arrow that hits the target
.   C          G/B       Am7              G
 I want to be used in a way that pleases You,
.   F        Em7     Dm7        G
 Anytime, anywhere, here is my life
.     C        F   G
 Use me, Lord, Use me

[V3]
.  C           Am7        F
 Search me, Break me, Change me
.  Dm7        F  G    C
 Fill me and use me Lord</lyrics>
