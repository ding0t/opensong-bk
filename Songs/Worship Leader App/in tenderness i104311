.A        C#m      E     B
 In tenderness He sought me
.A         C#m        E  B
 Weary and sick with sin
.A          C#m         E     B
 And on His shoulders brought me
.A           C#m  E     B
 Back to His fold again
.A            C#m    E        B
 While angels in His presence sang,
.A          C#m       E      B
 Until the courts of heaven rang

[C1]
.  A       C#m     E         B
   O - o - oh the love that sought me!
.  A       C#m      E         B
   O - o - oh the blood that bought me!
.  A      C#m          E                B       A
   Oh the grace that brought me to the fold of God
.  C#m                    B                 E
   Grace that brought me to the fold of God

[V2]
.A           C#m             E  B
 He died for me while I was sinning..
.A         C#m        E   B
 Needy and poor and blind
.A            C#m   E    B
 He whispered to assure me...
.A                 C#m       E    B
 &quot;I've found thee; thou art Mine&quot;
.A       C#m     E        B
 I never heard a sweeter voice,
.A          C#m     E       B
 It made my aching heart rejoice

[V3]
.A        C#m               E  B
 Upon His grace I'll daily ponder
.A         C#m       E    B
 And sing anew His praise
.A         C#m     E  B
 With all adoring wonder,
.A             C#m   E    B
 His blessings I retrace.
.A           C#m  E      B
 It seems as if eternal days,
.A           C#m       E         B
 Are far too short to sing His praise.</lyrics>
