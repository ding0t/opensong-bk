 INTRO:
 G C Em D C

[V2]
 VERSE1:
.Em        D                 C
  Standing tall in this wide space
.Em       D            C
  Getting lost in Your embrace
.Am       G/B         C
  I see a fire burning brighter
.Am            G/B            D
  It's calling me to catch the flame

[V3]
 VERSE2:
.Em                  D             C
  You're drawing me closer to Your side
.Em                D                    C
  It's the safest place I know where to hide
.Am         G/B                  C
  With one glance You captured my heart
.Am              G/B                                    D
  You speak Your words, You speak Your words that set me apart

[V4]
 CHORUS:
.G                D/F#
  I feel like I'm falling
.Em         C
  over and over in love with You
.Am               Bm
  It's not just a feeling
.C      D
  but I know that He is real
.G                D/F#
  I feel like I'm falling
.Em        C
  into the arms of the mighty God
.Am               Bm
  It's not just a feeling
.C      D
  but I know that He is real

[V5]

 I feel like I'm falling
.Em               D
  I feel like I'm falling
.C                G/B
  I feel like I'm falling
.Am          D
  Falling into the arms of love</lyrics>
