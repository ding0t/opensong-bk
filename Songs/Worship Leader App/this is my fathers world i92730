<lyrics>[V1]
 This is my Father's world,
 And to my listening ears
 All nature sings, and round me rings
 The music of the spheres.

[V2]
 This is my Father's world,
 The birds their carols raise,
 The morning light, the lily white,
 Declare their maker's praise.

[V3]
 This is my Father's world:
 He shines in all that's fair;
 In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
 He speaks to me everywhere.

[V4]
 This is my Father's world.
 O let me ne'er forget
 That though the wrong
 Seems oft so strong,
 God is the ruler yet.

[V5]
 This is my Father's world,
 Should my heart be ever sad?
 The lord is King-let the heavens ring.
 God reigns-let the earth be glad.

[V6]
 This is my Father's world:
 I rest me in the thought
 Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
 His hand the wonders wrought.

[V7]
 This is my Father's world:
 The battle is not done:
 Jesus who died shall be satisfied,
 And earth and Heav'n be one.

[V8]
 This is my Father's world,
 Dreaming, I see His face.
 I ope my eyes, and in glad surprise
 Cry, The Lord is in this place.

[V9]
 This is my Father's world,
 From the shining courts above,
 The Beloved One, His Only Son,
 Came-a pledge of deathless love.

[V10]
 This is my Father's world.
 Now closer to Heaven bound,
 For dear to God is the earth Christ trod.
 No place but is holy ground.

[V11]
 This is my Father's world.
 I walk a desert lone.
 In a bush ablaze to my wondering gaze
 God makes His glory known.

[V12]
 This is my Father's world,
 A wanderer I may roam;
 Whate'er my lot, it matters not,
 My heart is still at home.</lyrics>
