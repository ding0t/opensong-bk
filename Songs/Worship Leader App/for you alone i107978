<lyrics>[V1]
.G                       Bm7
 You are the peace that guards my heart
.   Am7               D7
 My help in times of need
.G                       Bm7
 You are the hope that leads me on
.    Cmaj7            D
 And brings me to my knees
.        Em              Bm7    Cmaj7              G
 For there I find you waiting and there I find relief
.        Am7                     G
 So with all my heart I'll worship
.    Cmaj7          D7
 And unto you I'll sing

[C1]
.          Cmaj7           D7
   For you alone deserve all glory
.          Bm7             Em
   For you alone deserve all praise
.             Cmaj7        D7
   Father we worship and adore you
.            Bm7           E(m)
   Father we long to see your face
.          Cmaj7           D
   For you alone deserve all glory
.          Bm7             Em
   For you alone deserve all praise
.           Am7               D7               G
   Father we love you and we worship you this day</lyrics>
