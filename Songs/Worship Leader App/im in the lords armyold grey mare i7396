 I may never march in the Infantry, (march)
 Ride in the cavalry, (pretend you're riding a horse)
 Shoot the artillery. (clap hands together)
 I may never zoom o'er the enemy, (spread arms out and pretend to be a plane)
 But I'm in the Lord's Army. (point one finger up to God)
 I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!) (salute)
 I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!)
 I may never march in the Infantry,
 Ride in the cavalry,
 Shoot the artillery.
 I may never zoom o'er the enemy,
 But I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!)</lyrics>
