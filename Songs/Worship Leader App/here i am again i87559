<lyrics>[V1]
 Here I am again dear Lord
 I'm calling on Your name
 I've done it many times before
 But this time's not the same
 'Cause I didn't come to ask You
 To give me something more
 I only came to say
 I love You Lord

[C1]
   I love You Lord
   More than tongue can ever tell
   And I know that You can see into
   The depths of my heart's well
   I love You Lord
   There's no other love like Yours
   I only came to say I love You Lord

[V2]
 Here I am again dear Lord
 I hope you didn't mind
 Times that I kept coming back
 With all the same old lines
 But this time I came to tell you
 What my heart can't keep inside
 I came to say I love You
 One more time</lyrics>
