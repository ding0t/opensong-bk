<lyrics>[V1]
 He came from Heaven's throne
 Embraced a crown of thorns
 Our Saviour and our King
 The sinner's friend

[V2]
 Clothed in flesh and bone
 Redemption in His blood
 New life flows through His veins
 Poured out for us

[V3]
 We sing worthy is The Lamb
 Worthy to be praised
 High and lifted up
 Jesus reigns

[V4]
 There's freedom in His scars
 And healing in His wounds
 O death, where is your sting
 Our saviour lives

[V5]
 We sing worthy is The Lamb
 Worthy to be praised
 High and lifted up
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns

[V6]
 What other King would take off His crown
 What other King would give up His throne
 What other King would hang on a cross,
 and lay down His life for love

[V7]
 What other King has risen from death
 What other King has conquered the grave
 What other King has rolled back the stone
 and walked from the tomb alive

[V8]
 What other King is mighty to save
 What other King is worthy of praise
 What other King is seated on high,
 in Heaven above in glory

[V9]
 We sing worthy is The Lamb
 Worthy to be praised
 High and lifted up
 Jesus reigns

[V10]
 We sing worthy is The Lamb
 Worthy to be praised
 High and lifted up
 Jesus reigns</lyrics>
