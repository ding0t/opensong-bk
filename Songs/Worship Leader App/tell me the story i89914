 There's a story come down thru the ages

[V2]
 But it's fresh every time that it's told
 You can find it in sweet holy pages
 And on lips of the young and the old.

[V3]
 Chorus: Tell me the story most precious
 Tell me the story so dear
 Tell me the story of Jesus
 that I still love to hear

[V4]
 Let me hear how the children stood 'round Him
 Let me hear how He walked on the sea
 How I long to hear how He gave His life
 For sinners like you and like me

[V5]
 There's the story of Shepherds and Angels
 How He healed and forgave from all sin
 But I know that the story's not over
 For His coming from glory again

[V6]
 Chorus for the last verse:
 Won't you tell me the story most precious
 Tell me the story so dear
 Tell me the story of Jesus
 that I still love to hear
 That I still love to hear, to hear</lyrics>
<title>Tell me the story</title>
