<lyrics>[V1]
 For of Him and through Him
 And to Him are all things
 For of Him and through Him
 And to Him are all things

[C1]
   To Him be glory
   To Him be glory
   To Him be glory
   Forever, amen

[V2]
 O the depth of the riches both
 Of the wisdom and knowledge of God
 How unsearchable are
 His judgments and His ways</lyrics>
