<lyrics>[V1]
 I've got something that the world can't give,
 and the world can't take away.
 I've got something that the world can't give,
 and it keeps me day by day.
 I've got something worth talking about.
 It makes me sing and it makes me shout:
 I've got something that the world can't give,
 and the world can't take away.</lyrics>
