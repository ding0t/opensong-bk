<lyrics>[V1]
 Alas, and did my Savior bleed and did my sovereign die
 Would He devote that sacred head for such a worm as I
 At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the Light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away, rolled away
 It was there by Faith, I received my sight
 And now I am happy all the day
 Was it for crimes that I have done, He crawled up on the tree
 Amazing pity, grace unknown and love beyond degree
 At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the Light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away, rolled away
 It was there by Faith, I received my sight
 And now, and now, and now I am happy all the day
 All the day.Alas, and did my Savior bleed and did my sovereign die
 Would He devote that sacred head for such a worm as I
 At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the Light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away, rolled away
 It was there by Faith, I received my sight
 And now I am happy all the day
 Was it for crimes that I have done, He crawled up on the tree
 Amazing pity, grace unknown and love beyond degree
 At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the Light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away, rolled away
 It was there by Faith, I received my sight
 And now, and now, and now I am happy all the day
 All the day.</lyrics>
