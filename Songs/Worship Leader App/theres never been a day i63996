<lyrics>[V1]
 There's never been a day
 Like this day to me,
 There's never been a day
 Like this day I see,
 There's never been a light
 That shines so bright
 As this day, this glorious day.

[V2]
 For Christ is revealing
 Himself unto me
 He's opened my eyes
 and now I can see
 His word has become
 a reality in this day
 this glorious day.</lyrics>
