<title>Stand in Your Love</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.     G          D          C
 When darkness tries to roll over my bones
.     G            C
 When sorrow comes to steal the joy I own
.   Em         D     C
 In brokenness and pain is all I know
.       Em              C
 Oh, I won't be shaken no, I won't be shaken

[C1]
.        G           D       C
   My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
.        G           D       C
   My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
.        Em          D       C
   My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love

[V2]
.       G                           D      C
 Oh and shame no longer has a place to hide
.  G                       C
 I am not a captive to the lies
.    Em                     D      C
 I'm not afraid to leave my past behind
.                 Em                 C
 Oh, I won't be shaken no, I won't be shaken

[B1]
.     D                Em
   There's power that can break off every chain
.     C                G
   There's power that can empty out a grave
.     D                  Em
   There's resurrection power that can save
.           C          G
   There's power in Your name power in Your name

[V3]
.  G        C
 I am standing on the rock
.Em        C       G
 I am standing in Your love
.  G     D      C
 I am standing on the rock
.    Em               C
 My firm foundation, my firm foundation</lyrics>
