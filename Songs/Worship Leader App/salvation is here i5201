<lyrics>[V1]
 God above all the world in motion,
 God above all my hopes and fears,
 Well I don't care what the world throws at me now,
 It's gonna be alright!

[V2]
 Hear the sounds of the generatorions,
 Making loud our freedom song,
 All in all that the world will know Your name,
 We're gonna be alright!

[V3]
 Cause I know my God saved the day,
 And I know His word never fails,
 And I know my God made a way for me,
 Salvation is here.

[V4]
 God above all the world in motion,
 God above all my hopes and fears,
 Well I don't care what the world throws at me now,
 It's gonna be alright!

[V5]
 Cause I know my God saved the day,
 And I know His word never fails,
 And I know my God made a way for me,
 It's gonna be alright!

[V6]
 Cause I know my God saved the day,
 And I know His word never fails,
 And I know my God made a way for me,
 Salvation is here.

[V7]
 Salvation is here,
 Salvation is here and it lives in me,
 Salvation is here,
 Salvation in God means to set me free,
 Salvation is here,
 Salvation is here and it lives in me,
 Salvation is here,
 Cause you are alive and you live in me!
 Salvation is here,
 Salvation is here and it lives in me,
 Salvation is here,
 Cause you are alive and you live in me!

[V8]
 Cause I know my God saved the day,
 And I know His word never fails,
 And I know my God made a way for me,
 It's gonna be alright!

[V9]
 Cause I know my God saved the day,
 And I know His word never fails,
 And I know my God made a way for me,
 Salvation is here.

[V10]
 Salvation is here and it lives in me,
 Salvation is here,
 Cause you are alive and you live in me!
 Salvation is here.</lyrics>
