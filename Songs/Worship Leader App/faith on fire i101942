 (Versus)
.         D
 There's an ember
.         G
 Deep within me
.       D
 But it's only
.      A
 A little flame
.       D
 But my faith keeps
.        G
 Growing stronger
.            D   A
 And it won't be long
.           D
 'Til it starts a blaze

[V2]
 (Chorus)
.      A      D
 Set my faith on fire
.        G   D
 That's my one desire
.        Bm
 Make my life
.  D          Asus A
 A pure and holy flame

[V3]
.      A      D
 So the world can see
.           G    D
 That there's a fire in me
.       Bm   D
 Burning by the power
.      Asus A
 Of your name

[V4]
.      Em
 Start a blaze
.         Asus A
 And set my faith
.      D   G  D
 Faith on fire

[V5]
 (Bridge)
.C
 We've got a message
.       G
 We must share it with the world
.D                  Asus
 Igniting every man and woman
.A
 Boy and girl

[V6]
