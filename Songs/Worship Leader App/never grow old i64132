<lyrics>[V1]
 I have heard of a land
 on the far away strand,
 'tis a beautiful home of the soul.
 Built by Jesus on high,
 there we never shall die,
 'tis a land where we never grow old.

[C1]
   kor:
   Never grow old, never grow old,
   in a land where we'll never grow old.
   Never grow old, never grow old,
   in a land where we never grow old.

[V2]
 In that beautiful home
 where we'll nevermore roam,
 we shall be in the sweet by and by.
 Happy praise to the king,
 through eternity sing,
 'tis a land where we never shall die.

[V3]
 When our work here is done
 and the life-crown is won,
 and our troubles and trials are o'er.
 All our sorrows will end,
 and our voices will blend,
 with the loved ones
 who've gone on before.</lyrics>
