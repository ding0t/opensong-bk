<lyrics>[V1]
 At night I laid in bed, and I begin to cry
 And my mind just fails to know exactly why
 I can't explain with tongue or pen
 The Spirit's groanings deep within
 It must be God here in my soul
 Cause I feel the pull.

[C1]
   I feel the pull
   I hear the call
   And I know His Spirit's moving me
   To give my all
   He speaks to me
   And I agree
   Lord please come and take control
   I feel the pull

[V2]
 I went to hear the Word
 And with each line and phrase
 Oh, He was drawing me to give a higher praise
 There is a deep, calling to the deep
 Like a great magnet pulling me
 I know for sure That I reach the goal
 Cause I feel the pull</lyrics>
