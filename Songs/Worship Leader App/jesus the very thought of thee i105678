.G          D    C       D  G
 Jesus, the very thought of Thee,
.G              A     D
 With sweetness fills my breast;
.C           D       A       D
 But sweeter far Thy face to see,
.G      C   G   D    G
 And in Thy presence rest.

[V2]
 [Verse 2]
.G            D        C     D   G
 No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
.G           A   D
 Nor can the memory find
.C         D          A      D
 A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
.G       C   G  D  G
 The Saviour of mankind.

[V3]
 [Verse 3]
.G         D     C   D    G
 O hope of every contrite heart!
.G        A   D
 O joy of all the meek,
.C            D         A         D
 To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
.G        C  G     D   G
 How good to those who seek!

[V4]
 [Verse 4]
.G           D         C     D   G
 But what to those who find? Ah! This
.G              A   D
 Nor tongue nor pen can show;
.C           D     A       D
 The love of Jesus-what it is,
.G        C   G     D    G
 None but His loved ones know.

[V5]
 [Verse 5]
.G          D    C   D  G
 Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
.G           A          D
 As Thou our prize wilt be;
.C          D       A     D
 In Thee be all our glory now,
.G           C G   D  G
 And through E-ter-ni-ty</lyrics>
