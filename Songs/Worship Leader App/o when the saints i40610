<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh, when the saints go marching in
 Oh, when the saints go marching in
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in

[V2]
 Oh, when the drums begin to bang
 Oh, when the drums begin to bang
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in

[V3]
 Oh, when the stars fall from the sky
 Oh, when the stars fall from the sky
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in

[V4]
 Oh, when the moon turns red with blood
 Oh, when the moon turns red with blood
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in

[V5]
 Oh, when the trumpet sounds its call
 Oh, when the trumpet sounds its call
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in

[V6]
 Oh, when the horsemen begin to ride
 Oh, when the horsemen begin to ride
 Oh Lord I want to be in that number
 When the saints go marching in</lyrics>
