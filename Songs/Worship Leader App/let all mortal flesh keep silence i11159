<lyrics>[V1]
.Dm                        C
 Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
.Bbmaj7                      Asus
 And with fear and trembling stand;
.Dm                     C
 Ponder nothing earthly minded,
.Bb                       Asus
 For with blessing in His hand,
.Dm                C2  C    Bb  Asus
 Christ our God to earth descendeth,
.Gm7             C2  C  Dm
 Our full homage to de-mand.

[V2]
.Dm                        C
 King of kings, yet born of Mary,
.Bbmaj7                 Asus
 As of old on earth He stood,
.Dm                       C
 Lord of lords, in human vesture,
.Bb                   Asus
 In the body and the blood;
.Dm              C2  C   Bb    Asus
 He will give to all the faith-ful
.Gm7               C2   C  Dm
 His own self for heav'nly food.

[V3]
.Dm                       C
 Rank on rank the host of heaven
.Bbmaj7                      Asus
 Spreads its vanguard on the way,
.Dm                       C
 As the Light of light descendeth
.Bb                         Asus
 From the realms of endless day,
.Dm                 C2       Bb  Asus
 That the pow'rs of hell may van-ish
.Gm7             C2  C  Dm
 As the darkness clears away.

[V4]
.Dm                         C
 At His feet the six winged seraph,
.Bbmaj7                  Asus
 Cherubim with sleepless eye,
.Dm                      C
 Veil their faces to the presence,
.Bb                           Asus
 As with ceaseless voice they cry:
.Dm         C2 C Bb  Asus
 Alleluia, Alleluia__
.Gm7       C2   C    Dm
 Alleluia, Lord Most High!</lyrics>
