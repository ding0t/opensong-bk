<lyrics>[V1]
 Cause you're an Eagle! You where born to soar up in the sky!
 Trusting in your wings to rise and fly in liberty
 Things beyond this nest you'll view
 Greater works than this you'll do
 Doubts you will defy to fly so high, so high, so high.
 Fly so high, so high, so high.

[V2]
 All the earthly trials I am facing on my way
 Help me know my Saviour better day by day
 Jesus calls me higher an I hold His promise tight,
 I am Joining Him in this celestial fight.

[V3]
 Cause I'm an eagle
 I was born to soar up in the sky!
 Trusting in your wings to rise and fly in liberty
 Things beyond this nest you'll view
 Greater works than this you'll do
 Coming to the place
 where my theophany I'll face</lyrics>
