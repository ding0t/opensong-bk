<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse 1]
 My past embraced
 My sin forgiven
 I'm blameless in Your sight
 My history rewritten

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 'Cause You delight in showing mercy
 And mercy triumphs over judgment
 You delight in showing mercy
 And mercy triumphs over judgment

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 Oh, love great love
 Fear cannot be found in You
 And there will never be a day
 You're uncertain of the ones You choose

[V4]
 [Chorus]
 'Cause You delight in showing mercy
 And mercy triumphs over judgment
 You delight in showing mercy
 And mercy triumphs judgment

[V5]
 [Bridge]
 So I will awake and spend my days
 Loving the One who has raised me up
 From death to life, from wrong to right
 You're making all things beautiful</lyrics>
