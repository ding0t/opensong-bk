<lyrics>[C1]
   God gave me a song
   I will sing for the rest of my life
   Jesus is the light
   The light of the world
   Come let us celebrate him
   Lift up your voices and sing
   Jesus is the light
   The light of the world

[V1]
 His Love is everlasting
 It will never fade away
 On Christ the solid rock I stand
 With darkness all around me
 When no one else could find me
 He came my way
 And turned my night to day

[V2]
 He's Alpha and Omega
 The beginning and the end
 Everlasting Father, the great I Am
 Sing holy holy holy
 is our God almighty
 All heaven declares
 the glory of His name

[V3]
 (Bridge)
 Celebrate the King
 Put all your trust in Him
 Celebrate the King
 Lift your voice and sing</lyrics>
