<lyrics>[C1]
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home with You
   Yeah

[V1]
 I lift my voice to praise You
 I lift my voice to praise You
 My concrete heart won't stop me
 My concrete heart won't stop me

[V2]
 I'll sing like it's the first time
 I'll sing like it's the first time
 And leave behind the cynic
 I leave behind the cynic in my soul

[P1]
   We're letting praise like fireworks
   Loose from our thankful hearts

[C2]
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home with You
   Yeah

[C3]
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing You our lives
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing You our lives
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing all our lives to You
   Yeah

[V3]
 Through joy and pain we worship
 Through joy and pain we worship
 With heart and soul wide open
 With heart and soul wide open

[V4]
 Your strength will never fail us
 Your strength will never fail us
 We're not lost in the darkness
 We're not lost in the darkness
 You are here

[P2]
   We're letting praise like fireworks
   Loose from our thankful hearts

[C4]
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home
   You've given us a heart, given us a home with You
   Yeah

[C5]
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing You our lives
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing You our lives
   We're bringing You our praise, bringing all our lives to You
   Yeah</lyrics>
