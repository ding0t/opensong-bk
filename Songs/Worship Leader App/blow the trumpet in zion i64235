<title>Blow The Trumpet in Zion</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 They rush on the city; they run on the wall.
 Great is the army that carries out His Word
 They rush on the city; they run on the wall
 Great is the army that carries out His Word
 The Lord utters His voice before His army.
 The Lord utters His voice before His army.

[C1]
   Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion.
   Sound the alarm on my holy mountain.
   Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion.
   Sound the alarm.</lyrics>
