<lyrics>[V1]
 From the rising of the sun
 to the going down of the same,
 the name of the Lord shall be praised.
 From the rising of the sun
 to the going down of the same,
 the Lord's name shall be praised.
 So praise ye the Lord.

[C1]
   Praise ye the Lord.
   From the rising of the sun
   to the going down of the same,
   the name of the Lord shall be praised.</lyrics>
