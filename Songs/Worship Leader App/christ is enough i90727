<lyrics>[V1]
.Bm           G
 Christ is my reward
.                 D    Asus/C#
 And all of my devotion
.              Bm              G
 Now there's nothing in this world
.                     D Asus/C#
 That could ever satisfy
.        F#m     G
 Through every trial
.     A        Bm
 My soul will sing
.     D/F#      G
 No turning back
.       Bm       A
 I've been set free

[C1]
.  D         Dsus       D
   Christ is enough for me
.  Bm                   A G
   Christ is enough for me
.  G            A       Bm
   Everything I need is in You
.  G            A
   Everything I need

[V2]
 Christ my all in all
 The joy of my salvation
 And this hope will never fail
 Heaven is our home
 Through every storm
 My soul will sing
 Jesus is here
 To God be the glory

[V3]
 Christ is enough for me
 Christ is enough for me
 Everything I need is in You
 Everything I need

[V4]
 I have decided to follow Jesus
 No turning back
 No turning back
 I have decided to follow Jesus
 No turning back
 No turning back (the cross)
 The cross before me
 The world behind me
 No turning back
 No turning back
 The cross before me
 The world behind me
 No turning back
 No turning back</lyrics>
