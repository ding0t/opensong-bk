.A        D             A
 I believe in the Holy Father
.                     E
 I believe in Jesus Christ
.      A  D             A
 I believe in the Holy Spirit
.         E          A
 I believe in God alright

[C1]
.         E  D              A
   And I know that He came down
.          E D           A
   To find me in my hometown
.           D                   A
   And to gently knock upon my door
.               E                 A
   But I believe there's so much more

[V2]
.           A  D               A
 More than just that I should open -
.        A              E
 Up my heart and to be saved
.        A   D                 A
 To be healed from all that's broken
.            A       E               A
 So that my road to heaven could be paved

[C2]
.           E   D             A
   No, I believe He came for more
.             E                         A
   More than just to settle sinners' scores
.             D                      A
   More than just to come and set me free
.               E             A
   But to establish Christ in me

[V3]
.          A  D             A
 You have made me in Your image
.        A                E
 So that I could be like You
.        A  D              A
 Father God, Holy Spirit, Jesus
.            A E               A
 Make Your wildest dreams come true

[C3]
.            E  D              A
   'Cause I know You came for more
.             E                       A
   More than just to settle sinners' scores
.             D                        A
   More than just to come and set me free
.            A   E            A
   But to establish Christ in me

[B1]
.           E   D            A
   Lord my heart belongs to You
.            E D               A
   Show me what You want me to do
.            D                  A
   Take me where You want me to be
.         A   E             A
   Come establish Christ in me</lyrics>
