<lyrics>[C1]
   Where do I go
   When I need a shelter
   Where do I go
   When I need a friend
   Where do I go
   When I need some helping
   Where do I go
   Back on my knees again

[V1]
 Ask me this question, I'll tell you no lies
 How did I get this fire in my life
 All is not certain, but I will get by
 Listen, I'll tell you why

[C2]
   Where do I go
   When I need a shelter
   Where do I go
   When I need a friend
   Where do I go
   When I need some helping
   Where do I go
   Back on my knees again

[V2]
 Sure as the winter comes after the fall
 Sure as true love tears down any wall
 Jesus is able to carry it all
 He will answer your call

[C3]
   Where do I go
   When I need a shelter
   Where do I go
   When I need a friend
   Where do I go
   When I need some helping
   Where do I go
   Back on my knees again</lyrics>
