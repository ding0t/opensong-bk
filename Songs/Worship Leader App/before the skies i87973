<title>Before the Skies</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Before the skies were stretched abroad
 From everlasting was the Word
 God was He; the Word was God
 And He must be adored
 By the Word all came to be
 The universe and all contained
 Showing God's authority
 His power and His reign

[C1]
   Glory, glory
   Glory in the highest
   Glory, glory
   Glory God is with us
   With us

[V2]
 Though His glories still proceed
 Never changing from our Lord
 He laid down His majesty
 And took on human form
 Mortals here beheld His face
 The Heav'nly Father's perfect Son
 Full of truth and full of grace
 The Savior now has come!

[V3]
 He gave up His life in love
 So our lips could gladly tell
 Christ, the Word, has come to us
 Our Lord, Immanuel</lyrics>
