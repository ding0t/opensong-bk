 Verse: 1
.B
 Have you ever seen the wonder
.B
 In the glimmer of first sight
.            E
 As the eyes begin to open
.          G#m7
 And the blindness meets the light
.E
 If you have so say

.  B
   I see the world in light
.  B
   I see the world in wonder
.  B
   I see the world in life
.  B
   Bursting in living colour
.  E
   I see the world Your way
.              B
   And I'm walking in the light

[V2]

 If you have so say
