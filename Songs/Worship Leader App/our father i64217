 Hear our prayer
 we are your children and
 we've gathered here today
 We've gathered here to pray

[V2]
 Hear our cry, Lord we need your mercy
 And we need your grace today
 hear us as we pray

[C1]
   Our Father who art in heaven
   hallowed be thy name'
   our father hear us from heaven
   forgive our sins we pray

[V3]
 Hear our song
 As it rises to heaven
 May your glory fill the earth
 as the water covers the sea

[V4]
 See our heart
 And remove anything
 that is standing in the way
 Of coming to you today

[C2]
   Our Father who art in heaven
   hallowed be thy name'
   our father hear us from heaven
   forgive our sins we pray

[B1]
   And though we are few
   we're surrounded by many
   Who have crossed that river before
   And this is the song we'll be singing for ever:

[B2]
   HOLY is the LORD, HOLY is the LORD,
   HOLY is the LORD, HOLY is the LORD

[B3]
   HOLY is the LORD, HOLY is the LORD,
   HOLY is the LORD, HOLY is the LORD

[C3]
   Our Father who art in heaven
   hallowed be thy name'
   our father hear us from heaven
   // forgive our sins we pray //  (x3)</lyrics>
