 Holy words long preserved

 For our walk in this world

 Oh, let the ancient words impart

 Holy words of our Faith
 Handed down to this age
 Came to us through sacrifice
 Oh, heed the faithful words of Christ

 Holy words long preserved
 For our walk in this world
 They resound with God's own heart
 Oh, let the ancient words impart

[C2]
   Word of God ever true
   Changing me and changing you
   We have come with open hearts
   Oh, let the word of God impart</lyrics>
