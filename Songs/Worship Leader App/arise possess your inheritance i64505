<lyrics>[C1]
   Arise! and possess your inheritance
   This is the year of jubilee
   Arise! and brake the yoke of bondage
   For Christ has come to set the captives free

[V1]
 I was entangled with heavy chains of captivity
 I was bruised and mattered by sin
 once condemned, and sentenced to a life of bondage
 Oh God - there was no peace within

[V2]
 But then a sound was heard
 It was like the abundance of rain
 It said &quot;Rejoice, you have received the atonement.
 Accept the pardoning work which was provided for you
 because - you're not of the bound woman;
 You're of the free

[V3]
 Aren't you tired of living underprivileged
 Saints don't you, listen, don't you hear that sound
 Setting freedom to the captives
 restoration to the blind
 Setting free those who are bruiced

[V4]
 Saints, empty your vessels and let him fill them with gold
 You are free, you are free, you are free

[V5]
 So when the creditor comes,
 to take away your land
 Show him your account
 settled a long ago by Calvary's Lamb
 I am free, I am free, I am free

[V6]
 Now I can tell the world that I am free
 I have heard the trumpet sound Jubilee
 It sounded freedom from all burdens and sin
 The Comforter has given me peace within
 and &quot;Whom The Son has set free is free indeed&quot;</lyrics>
