<lyrics>[V1]
 At break of day
 In hope we rise
 We speak your name
 We lift our eyes
 Tune our hearts
 Into your beat
 Where we walk there You'll be

[P1]
   With fire in our eyes
   Our lives a light
   Your love untamed
   It's blazing out
   The streets will glow
   Forever bright
   Your glory's breaking through the night

[C1]
   // You will never fade away
   Your love is here to stay
   By my side in my life
   Shining through me everyday //

[V2]
 You wake within me
 Wake within me
 You're in my heart forever
 You wake within me
 Wake within me
 You're in my heart forever

[B1]
   /// Forever, Forever, Forever In Your love ///
   Forever, Forever, Forever, We know that</lyrics>
