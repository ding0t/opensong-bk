<lyrics>[V1]
 There is a river
 that flows from deep within.
 There is a fountain
 that frees my soul from sin.
 Come to this water,
 there is a vast supply.
 There is a river
 that never shall run dry.

[V2]
 There was a thirsty woman,
 Who was drawing from a well,
 Her life was ruined and wasted,
 Her soul was bound for hell.
 Then she met the Master,
 Who told of her great sin,
 He said, &quot;If you drink this water,
 You'll never thirst again.&quot;

[V3]
 There came a sound from Heaven
 As a rushing, mighty wind,
 It filled their hearts with singing,
 And gave them peace within.
 The prophet gave the promise,
 The Spirit will descend,
 And from your inner being,
 A river with no end.</lyrics>
