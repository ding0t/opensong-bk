<lyrics>[V1]
 Amazing Grace shall always
 be my song of praise,
 For it was Grace that
 bought my liberty
 I do not know just how
 He came to love me so
 He looked beyond my faults
 and saw my needs

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   I shall forever lift
   my eyes to Calvary,
   to view the cross where
   Jesus gave His life for me,
   how marvelous the Grace
   that caught my falling soul
   He looked beyond my
   faults and saw my needs

[V2]
 It was God's Grace that
 brought me out of darkness
 and to the light where
 I can clearly see
 I'll shout it from the mountains
 and the valleys
 He looked beyond my faults
 and saw my needs</lyrics>
