<lyrics>[V1]
 When we sing praises the Earth begins to tremble
 and the walls will fall down !
 When we adore You the chains will be broken
 and the walls will fall down !

[C1]
   // The walls are falling down //
   with a shout of victory
   they will fall
   // The walls are falling down //
   with a song of jubilee
   they will fall

[V2]
 When we dance in You we find our strenght
 and the walls will fall down !
 When we shout Your anthem, the enemy will flee
 and the walls will fall down !

[P1]
   The walls are falling (x8)
   Caen los muros (x8)

[B1]
   // We're dancing, rejoicing
   The walls are falling down
   We're shouting, declaring:
   The walls are falling down ! //</lyrics>
