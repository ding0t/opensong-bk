<lyrics>[V1]
 My faith looks up to Thee,
 Thou Lamb of Calvary,
 Savior divine!
 Now hear me while I pray,
 Take all my guilt away,
 O let me from this day
 Be wholly Thine!

[V2]
 May Thy rich grace impart
 Strength to my fainting heart,
 My zeal inspire;
 As Thou hast died for me,
 O may my love to Thee
 Pure, warm, and changeless be,
 A living fire!

[V3]
 While life's dark maze I tread,
 And griefs around me spread,
 Be Thou my Guide;
 Bid darkness turn to day,
 Wipe sorrow's tears away,
 Nor let me ever stray
 From Thee aside.

[V4]
 When ends life's transient dream,
 When death's cold, sullen stream
 Shall o'er me roll;
 Blest Savior, then, in love,
 Fear and distrust remove;
 O bear me safe above,
 A ransomed soul!</lyrics>
