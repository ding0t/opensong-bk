 Touch your fingers to your nose,
 Bend from the waist way down
 And touch your toes,
 And when you come up slowly,
 Start to sing, and say to the Lord,
 &quot;I love you.&quot;

[C1]
   &quot;I love you, I love you.&quot;
   Say to the Lord,
   &quot;I love you.&quot;
   &quot;I love you, I love you.&quot;
   Say to the Lord,
   &quot;I love you!&quot;

[V2]
 Reach your hands up to the sky,
 Look to your left, then right,
 And blink your eyes,
 And when you turn around,
 You'll start to sing, and say to the Lord,
 &quot;I love you.&quot;</lyrics>
