.G
 Lord how You've loved me, I don't deserve
.Em       C      G
 Grace on top of grace
.G
 More than I've asked for, more than I'm worth
.Em       C      G
 Grace on top of grace

[P1]
.  Em        G
   How sweet the sound
.  Am         G
   Once lost, now found
.  Em     G
   Heaven came down
.  C                  G
   And grace rescued me

[C1]
.       C     G    D
   Hallelujah I am free
.          Em           C
   From my sin and penalty
.                   G       D
   At the cross You took my place
.            Em       C      G
   With Your grace on top of grace

[B1]
.  Em      G       C       G
   Oooh Oh Oooh Oh Oooh Oh Oooh
.  Em      G       C       D
   Oooh Oh Oooh Oh Oooh Oh Oooh

[V2]
.    G          C             G
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
.     G                   D
 That saved a wretch like me
.  G        Bm        C       G
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
.    Em         D      C
 Was blind, but now I see</lyrics>
