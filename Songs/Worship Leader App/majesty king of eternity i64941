<lyrics>[V1]
 Ma-jes-ty, King for Eternity
 Earth and sea and Heaven
 All is made by you
 Ma-jes-ty, King for Eternity
 Fortress of deliverance
 Safest place to hide

[C1]
   We will exault your name King Jesus
   Every knee must bow infront of you
   We will exault your name king Jesus
   There is non like you
   For there is non like you.

[V2]
 King of kings,
 Majesty, God of heaven
 Living in me
 Gentle Saviour, closest friend
 Strong deliverer, beginning and end
 All within me, fall at your feet
 Your ma-jes-ty

[C2]
   Your majesty, I can't but bow
   I lift my all, before you now
   In royal robes, I don't deserve
   I live to serve your ma-jes-ty</lyrics>
<title>Majesty King of Eternity</title>
