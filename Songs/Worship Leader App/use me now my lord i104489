<lyrics>[V1]
 Use me now my Lord, I am your servant
 Let me be your shining light
 Use me now my Lord, to reach to others
 Fill me up with Your Spirit, until You shine so bright
 So use me oh please, my Lord use me now

[C1]
   I'll be your light will start to shine to others
   A beacon for my sisters and brothers
   Shelter for the pouring rain
   So you can take the pain
   I'll be a bridge upon the troubled waters
   A friend to guide sons and daughters
   Into your willing arms embrace
   So You can loving me
   Give us your grace

[V2]
 Use me now my Lord, help me to be humble
 Help me to be strong and to grow
 Use me now my Lord, to teach your gospel
 Fill me up with Your Presence until i overflow
 So use me, oh please, my Lord. Use me now

[B1]
   Use me now. Fill me up
   Reach out to me. Give us your grace
   Till i see you, my Lord</lyrics>
