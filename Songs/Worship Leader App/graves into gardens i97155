<lyrics>[V1]
.E/B            B
 I searched the world
.    E/B         B
 But it couldn't fill me
.             G#m
 Man's empty praise
.                   F#
 and treasures that fade
.           E
 Are never enough
.               B
 Then You came along
.E/B                B
 And put me back together
.           G#m               F#
 And every desire is now satisfied
.             E
 Here in Your love

[V2]
 CHORUS
.            B
 Oh there's nothing better than You
.        G#m
 There's nothing better than You
.              E
 Lord there's nothing, nothing is better

[V3]
.     B
 than You

[V4]

 VERSE 3
.         B
 I'm not afraid
.   E              B
 To show You my weakness
.                G#m
 My failures and flaws
.                      F#
 Lord You've seen them all
.                      E
 And You still call me friend
.                       B
 'Cause the God of the mountain
.       C#m         B
 Is the God of the valley
.              G#m
 There's not a place
.               F#
 Your mercy and grace
.              E
 Won't find me again

[B1]
.  B       E B
    You turn mourning to dancing
.                           E B
   You give beauty for ashes
   You turn shame into glory
.             G#m  E       B
   You're the only one who can.

[B2]
   You turn graves into gardens
   You turn bones into armies
   You turn seas into highways
   You're the only one who can.</lyrics>
