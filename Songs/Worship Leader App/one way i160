 I lay my life down at Your feet

 Cause You're the only One I need
.A.                                G
 I turn to You and You are always there
.D
 In troubled times it's You I seek
.Bm
 I put You first that's all I need
.A.                       G
 I humble all I am, all to You

 You are always always there

 Everyhow and everywhere

 You will never ever change

 Forever 'til forever meets no end
