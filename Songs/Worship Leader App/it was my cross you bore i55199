<title>It Was My Cross You Bore</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 It was my cross You bore
 So I could live in the freedom You died for
 And now my life is Yours
 And I will sing of Your goodness forevermore

[C1]
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name

[V2]
 And now my shame is gone
 I stand amazed in Your love undeniable
 Your grace goes on and on
 And I will sing of Your goodness forever more

[C2]
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name

[B1]
   Be exalted now in the heavens
   As Your glory fills this place
   You alone deserve our praise
   You're the name above all names

[C3]
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name
   Worthy is Your name, Jesus
   You deserve the praise
   Worthy is Your name</lyrics>
