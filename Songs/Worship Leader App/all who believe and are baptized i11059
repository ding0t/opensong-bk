 All who believe and are baptized shall see the Lord's salvation; baptized into the death of Christ, they are a new creation. through Christ's redemption they shall stand among the glorious heav'nly band of every tribe and nation.

[V2]
 With one accord, O God, we pray: grant us thy Holy Spirit; look thou on our infirmity through Jesus' blood and merit. Grant us to grow in grace each day that by this sacrament we may eternal life inherit.</lyrics>
