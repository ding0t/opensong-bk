<lyrics>[C1]
   He's got the whole world in His hands,
   He's got the whole wide world in His hands,
   He's got the whole world in His hands,
   He's got the whole wide world in His hands.

[V1]
 He's got my father and my mother in His hands,
 He's got my brother and my sister in His hands,
 He's got you and me my friend, in His hands,
 He's got the whole world in His hands.

[V2]
 He's got the sun and the rain in His hands,
 He's got the moon and the stars in His hands,
 He's got the wind and the clouds in His hands,
 He's got the whole world in His hands.

[V3]
 He's got the rivers and the mountains in His hands,
 He's got the oceans and the seas in His hands,
 He's got you and he's got me in His hands,
 He's got the whole world in His hands.

[V4]
 He's got everybody here in His hands,
 He's got everybody there in His hands,
 He's got everybody everywhere in His hands,
 He's got the whole world in His hands.</lyrics>
