<lyrics>[V1]
.C
  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
.F
  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
.Am                 G                      F
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings
.C
  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
.F
  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
.Am                 G                      F
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings

[C1]
.                    C
   This is amazing grace
.                     F
   This is unfailing love
.                          Am
   That You would take my place
.                         Gsus G
   That You would bear my cross
.                           C
   You would lay down Your life
.                       F
   That I would be set free
.      Am
   Ohhh Jesus, I sing for
.  G                           C
    All that You've done for me

[V2]
.C
  Who brings our chaos back into order
.F
  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
.Am                 G                F
  The King of Glory, The King of Glory
.C
  Who rules the nations with truth and justice
.F
  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
.Am                 G                        F
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings

[B1]
.  C
   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
.  F
   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
.  Am
   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
.  F
   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave</lyrics>
