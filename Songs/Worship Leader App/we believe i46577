.D                  Dsus  D                              Dsus
 In a time of desperation, when all we know is doubt and fear,
.Bm                     G             D           Dsus
 There is only one foundation: we believe, we believe.

 In this broken generation, when all is dark, You help us see;
.Bm                    G             D           Dsus
 There is only one salvation: we believe, we believe.

 So, let our faith be more than anthems, greater than the songs we sing;
.       Bm                   G            D           Dsus4
 And in our weakness and temptations we believe, we believe.

   Let the lost be found and dead be raised, in the here and now, let love invade,
.            G                    A                  Bm         F#m

   And the gates of hell will not prevail, for the power of God has torn the veil,
.           G                   A               Bm         F#m/C#
