<lyrics>[V1]
 Once I was clothed in the rags of my sin
 Wretched and poor lost and lonely within
 But with wonderous compassion the King of all Kings
 In pity and love took me under his wing.

[C1]
   Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King
   His royal blood now flows in my veins
   And I who was wretched and poor now can sing
   Praise God Praise God I'm a child of the King.

[V2]
 Now I'm a child with a heavenly home
 My holy father has made me his own
 And I am cleansed by his blood and I'm clothed in his love
 And someday I'll sing with the angels above.

[C2]
   Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King
   His royal blood now flows in my veins
   And I who was wretched and poor now can sing
   Praise God Praise God I'm a child of the King!</lyrics>
