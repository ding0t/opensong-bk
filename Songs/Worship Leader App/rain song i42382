.Em                         D2   Em                D2
 Bring rivers in this wasteland, clouds into the sky.
.Em                      D2            Em                 D2
 Bring springs of life into the wells that have been run dry.

[P1]
.  Em                 D2 Em                D2
   Rise up in this city. Gather in this light.
.  Em                    D2 Em                     D2
   Pour down on your people Your glory and Your life.

[C1]
.  Em
   Rain. Lord, we thirst for water.
.  G
   Rain. We are desert land.
.  Asus
   Rain on your sons and daughters.
.  C
   Rain. Bring your rain again.

[V2]
.Em                      D2   Em                   D2
 Speak dreams into this water and vision to this land.
.Em                 D2 Em                     D2
 Let oceans be divided and bring forth life again.

[B1]
.  Am                   C                     Em
    Let the tide roll in, washing over our lives.
.  Am                        C
    Let your water fall again.
.  Em                          D2  Em               D2
   Bring rivers in this wasteland, clouds into the sky.

[B2]
.  Em
    Bring your rain again.
.  G                        Asus
    Let your water fall down.
.                            C
   Bring your rain again now. (2X)</lyrics>
