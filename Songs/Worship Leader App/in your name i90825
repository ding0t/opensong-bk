<lyrics>[V1]
 When life is overwhelming
 And fear is all I feel
 Your word that lives inside me
 Reminds me You are here
 My hope You restore
 Your promise is sure
 And I am convinced
 That You are faithful
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 The stars they hold Your promise
 You guide me through the night
 My heart is set to worship
 My great reward is Christ
 My hope You restore
 Your promise is sure
 And I am convinced
 That You are faithful
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 (Your name, Jesus)
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 (Oh, Your holy name)
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 (In Your name)
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 All shadows are lost
 Your light's breaking through
 Shaken no more
 I see only You
 All shadows are lost
 Your light's breaking through
 Shaken no more
 I see only You
 All shadows are lost
 Your light's breaking through
 Shaken no more
 I see only you
 I see only you
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 (In Your name)
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 (It is Your name, Jesus)
 All things are possible
 In Your name
 We believe in Your power, Jesus
 We believe in Your name
 All things are possible</lyrics>
