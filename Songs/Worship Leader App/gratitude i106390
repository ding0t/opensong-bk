<lyrics>[V1]
 All my words fall short
 I got nothing new
 How could I express
 All my gratitude?

[V2]
 I could sing these songs
 As I often do
 But every song must end
 And You never do

[C1]
   So I throw up my hands
   And praise You again and again
   'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
   Hallelujah

[C2]
   And I know it's not much
   But I've nothing else fit for a King
   Except for a heart singing hallelujah
   Hallelujah

[V3]
 I've got one response
 I've got just one move
 With my arm stretched wide
 I will worship You

[C3]
   So I throw up my hands
   And praise You again and again
   'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
   Hallelujah

[C4]
   And I know it's not much
   But I've nothing else fit for a King
   Except for a heart singing hallelujah
   Hallelujah

[B1]
   So come on, my soul
   Oh, don't you get shy on me
   Lift up your song
   'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs</lyrics>
