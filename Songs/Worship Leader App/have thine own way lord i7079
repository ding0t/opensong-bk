.Eb
 Have Thine own way, Lord!
.             Bb7
 Have Thy own way!
.                              Eb
 Thou art the Potter; I am the clay.
.                    Eb7       Ab
 Mold me and make me after Thy will,
.           Eb       Bb7         Eb
 While I am waiting, Yielded and still.

 Search me and try me, Master, today!

 As in Thy presence Humbly I bow.
