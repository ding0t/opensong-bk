<lyrics>[V1]
 I want to scream it out
 From every mountain top
 Your goodness knows no bounds
 Your goodness never stops
 Your mercy follows me
 Your kindness fills my life
 Your Love amazes me

[C1]
   I sing because you are good
   And I dance because you are good
   And I
   shout because you are good
   You are good to me to me

[V2]
 Nothing and no one comes
 Anywhere close to you
 The earth and oceans deep
 Only reflect this truth
 And in my darkest night
 You shine as bright as day
 Your Love amazes me

[B1]
   With a cry of praise, my heart will proclaim
   You are good! You are good!
   In the sun or rain, my life celebrates
   You are good You are good
   With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
   You are good! You are good!
   In the sun or rain, my life celebrates
   You are good! You are good!</lyrics>
