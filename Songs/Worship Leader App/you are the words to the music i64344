 You are the words and the music,
 You are the song that I sing.
 You are the melody,
 You are the harmony,
 Praise to Your name I will bring..
 You are the mighty God,
 You are the Lord of lords,
 You are the King of all kings.
 // Now I return to You
 the song that You gave to me.
 You are the song that I sing. //</lyrics>
