<lyrics>[V1]
.C     G       Am
 Jesus draw me close,
.F      C       G
 Closer Lord to You;
.C       G      Am       F     G
 Let the world around me fade away;

[V2]
.C     G       Am
 Jesus draw me close,
.F      C       G
 Closer Lord to You;
.    F   G       Am      G    F   C
 For I desire to worship and obey.</lyrics>
