.         E
 Put your hand in the hand of the man
.                B
 Who stilled the water
.         F#m                     B
 Put your hand in the hand of the man
.               E
 Who calmed the sea
.       Bm
 Take a look at yourself
.    E7              A               Edim
 And you can look at others differently
.         E/B                     B
 Put your hand in the hand of the man
.         E
