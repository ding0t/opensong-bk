<lyrics>[V1]
 1 Years I spent in vanity and pride,
 Caring not my Lord was crucified,
 Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
 Refrain:
 Mercy there was great and grace was free,
 Pardon there was multiplied to me,
 There my burdened soul found liberty-
 At Calvary.
 2 By God's Word at last my sin I learned-
 Then I trembled at the Law I'd spurned,
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary. [Refrain]
 3 Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything,
 Now I gladly own Him as my King,
 Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary. [Refrain]
 4 O the love that drew salvation's plan!
 O the grace that brought it down to man!
 O the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary. [Refrain]</lyrics>
