   Intro

[V1]
.G              A                      Bm
  I tasted the world, seen more than enough
.    D/F#
 Its promises fleeting
.G              A                   Bm
  Of water and wine, I emptied the cup
.     D/F#
 And found myself wanting

[P2]
.  G                A                  Bm  A
    But there is a well that never runs dry
.  G              A                     Bm
    The water of life, the blood of the vine

[C1]
.  A     D
   All I know is
.    A                        Bm
   E - verything I have means nothing
.     G                      D
   Je - sus if you're not my one thing
.    A                        Bm
   E - verything I need right now
.                          G
   All I need is You right now

   (Instrumental)

[V2]
.G                  A                   Bm
  Just one thing I ask and this I will seek
.   D/F#
 If only to know You
.G                A                    Bm
  To be where You are and go where You lead
.    D/F#
 My God, I will follow

[P4]
.  G                   A                    Bm   A
    The things of this world I've counted as loss
.  G             A                   Bm
    I lay it all down to take up this cross

[C2]

   'Cause all I want is
.      A                     Bm
   E - verything You are and nothing
.       G                    D
   Je - sus if You're not my one thing
.      A                     Bm G
   E - verything to me right now

   And to be with You, my God
