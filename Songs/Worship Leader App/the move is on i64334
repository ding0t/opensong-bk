<lyrics>[C1]
   The move is on, my Lord,
   the move is on;
   The move is on, my Lord,
   the move is on.
   I can hear the rustle
   in the mulberry trees,
   and I know, I know, I know
   the move is on.

[V1]
 Move on brother,
 move on sister,
 this is the moving day.
 Move a little closer,
 where the streams are flowing,
 move on brother, move on.</lyrics>
