<lyrics>[V1]
 God's attributes were manifested
 to His Bride in this last age,
 We have caught the revelation
 By the last prophet's message;
 And we know who we are
 And what we are raised up for,
 Praise the Lord for the Original Life.

[C1]
   The Original Life, the Original Seed,
   The Original Word is what I believe;
   The Son of Man is revealed,
   The Seventh Seal is unveiled,
   The Original Life, the Original Seed.

[V2]
 We are the Word made flesh today,
 This is what the Scriptures say;
 And our names are seen within,
 Redeemed and perfect without sin;
 Yes, we are anointed and inspired
 By our God, Who's the Original Life.

[V3]
 Our eyes of understanding
 He has opened up at last,
 And sweet victory is ours
 Who were chained down in the past;
 True Jubilee has sounded
 And we have responded
 To our God, Who's the Original Life.

[V4]
 We are called unto adoption,
 Full authority and power;
 Sleeping saints will wake and join us
 For translation in this hour.
 Gentiles' days soon will be over,
 Glory, hallelujah!
 To our God, Who's the Original Life.</lyrics>
