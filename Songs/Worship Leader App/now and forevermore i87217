.Em        C           D    C
 Long before the world began
.      Em             C           D C
 My name was carved upon Your hand
.Am                            G      D
 Waiting through the years that passed
.      Am                       D  Em
 To give Your love to me, at last__

.  Em                  C                           D G D G
   Years passing by could not alter my value to You
.  Em              C                              D G D G
   Time is my ally in proving Your love to be true
