<lyrics>[V1]
 Search me, O God, and know my heart today,
 Try me, O Savior, know my thoughts, I pray;
 See if there be some wicked way in me;
 Cleanse me from every sin, and set me free.

[V2]
 I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
 Fulfill Thy word and make me pure within;
 Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame;
 Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.

[V3]
 Lord, take my life, and make it wholly Thine;
 Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
 Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
 I now surrender, Lord, in me abide.

[V4]
 O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;
 Send a revival, start the work in me;
 Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
 For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead</lyrics>
