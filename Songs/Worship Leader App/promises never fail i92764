<lyrics>[V1]
.Eb
 You are with me
 What can separate us
.Eb
 You are for me
 What can stand against us
.Cm
 Your love it won't let go
.Ab
 I know it won't

[V2]
 Darkness, shadows
 Have no power over me
 Fear is empty
 Shame has no authority
 Your love it won't let go
 I know it won't

[C1]
.      Eb
   I know Your thoughts Your plans for me are good
.      Cm7
   I know You hold My future and my hope
.  Ab             Eb
   Your promises never fail
.  Ab             Bb
   Your promises never fail

[V3]
 Healing and freedom
 As You speak favor over me
 Faith is breaking
 All impossibility
 Your name has overcome
 Your name alone

[B1]
.  Eb
   I am standing on every promise that You make
.     Ab                  Eb           Cm7           Ab
   I will see it come to pass in Your name, in Your name
.   Cm7                      Ab              Eb
   Jesus I will trust every word I hear You say
.          Ab             Eb       Cm7               Ab
   I will see it come to pass in Your name, in Your name</lyrics>
