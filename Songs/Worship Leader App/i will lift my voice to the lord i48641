<title>I will lift my voice to the Lord</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry

[V2]
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead, I will plead
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead

[V3]
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him

[V4]
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry

[V5]
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead, I will plead
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead

[V6]
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him

[V7]
 (INTERLUDE)

[V8]
 I will tell of my woes before him
 I will tell of my woes before him

[V9]
 I will tell of my woes before him
 I will tell of my woes before him

[V10]
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord

[V11]
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord</lyrics>
