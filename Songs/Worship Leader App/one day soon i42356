<lyrics>[V1]
 One day soon
 I'll be with You (Whoa)
 One day soon
 When life is through (Whoa)
 I'll go home (go home)
 To be (to be)
 Forever You ooohhhhh

[C1]
   Suddenly in the blink of an eye
   We'll be caught up
   To meet him in the sky
   So don't cry if you're feeling way down
   We're gonna kiss this world good-bye!
   (Smooch, Smooch, smooch)</lyrics>
