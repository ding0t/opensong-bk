<lyrics>[V1]
 Hope has found its home within me
 Now that I've been found in You
 Let all that I am be all You want me to be
 'Cause all I want is more of You
 'Cause all I want is more of You

[V2]
 Let Your presence fall upon us
 I want to see You face to face
 Let me live forever lost in Your love
 'Cause all I want is more of You
 'Cause all I want is more of You

[C1]
   I'm living for this cause
   I lay down my life into Your hands
   I'm living for the truth
   The hope of the world, in You I'll stand

[C2]
   All I want is You
   All I want is You
   All I want is You</lyrics>
