<lyrics>[V1]
 This is the day You've made
 So I will lift my voice and give You praise
 This is the day You've made
 So I will lift my voice and give You praise
 You are worthy
 You are worthy
 You are worthy
 You are worthy

[V2]
 Lord when You are glorified
 My heart is satisfied to know
 All praise and honor are Yours
 And when all creation sings
 To You the King of Kings we know
 All praise and honor are Yours</lyrics>
