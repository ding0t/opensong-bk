<lyrics>[V1]
.D             Am
  Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
.C               G
  Holy, Holy, is He
.D                Am
  Sing a new song, to him who sits on
.C                G
  Heaven's mercy seat

[C1]
.  D
    Holy, Holy, Holy
.  Am
    Is the Lord God Almighty
.  C                            G
    Who was, and is, and is to come
.  D
    With all creation I sing
.  Am
    Praise to the King of Kings
.  C
    You are my everything
.  G                   D   Am, C, G
    And I will adore You...

[V2]
.D                    Am
  Clothed in rainbows, of living color
.C                        G
  Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
.D                                Am
  Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
.C                     G
  To You the only wise King

[V3]
.D                   Am
  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
.C                        G
  At the mention of your name
.D
  Jesus your name is power
.Am
  Breath, and living water
.C                    G
  Such a marvellous mystery...</lyrics>
