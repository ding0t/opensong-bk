<lyrics>[V1]
 When I think of all He left,
 and what he came to.
 I'm convinced that it's the greatest mystery.
 Just to think that Heaven's King would leave it all and
 come for one like me.

[C1]
   Isn't it Amazing
   (Isn't It amazing that He'd come to where we are)
   Isn't it Amazing
   (Isn't it amazing that a King would go that far)
   Doesn't it Amaze you
   (Doesn't it amaze you that we'd find Him in this place)
   Ohh Isn't it Amazing Grace

[V2]
 If I started writing now and wrote forever.
 I know that all my words would not convey.
 The depth of love so great that brings the spotless lamb to
 take my place.

[C2]
   Isn't it Amazing
   (Isn't It amazing that He'd come to where we are)
   Isn't it Amazing
   (Isn't it amazing that a King would go that far)
   Doesn't it Amaze you
   (Doesn't it amaze you that we'd find Him in this place)
   Ohh Isn't it Amazing Grace

[V3]
 For our sin and death he brought us life forever.
 For our broken lives he brought us perfect peace.
 From the shackles and the chain the King of Glory
 came to set us free.
 He Set Us Free.

[C3]
   Lord I want to Thank You
   (Lord I want to Thank You that you come to where we are)
   Lord I want to Thank You
   (Lord I want to Thank You that a King would go that far)
   Lord I want to Thank You
   (Lord I want to Thank You that we feel You in this place)
   Thank you Jesus for Amazing Grace</lyrics>
