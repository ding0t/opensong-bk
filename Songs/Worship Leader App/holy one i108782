<lyrics>[V1]
 holy one
 righteous king
 merciful you are
 merciful i'll be

[V2]
 broken one
 bruised for me
 in your death o lord
 you have set me free

[V3]
 because your father loved me so
 you came to me lord Jesus so that i would know
 love unconditional
 and life eternal
 oh my lord
 my god my all

[V4]
 risen one
 majesty
 restoration
 lord breathe new life in me</lyrics>
