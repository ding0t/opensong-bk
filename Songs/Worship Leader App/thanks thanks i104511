   Thanks thanks I give you thanks For all you´ve done
   I am so blessed My soul has found rest
   Oh Lord I give you thanks

[V1]
 I thank you for the strength you give to simply carry on
 Through life´s toils and tests in the worst and best I´m not ever left alone
 You are always right beside me Hear me every time I pray
 Since I first began, you´ve been dearest friend
 And I give you all the praise

[V2]
 I give you thanks this moment And I will continually
 For each day I live new grace you give I´m blessed abundantly
 And I can´t forget that moment when in my life you made such a change
 Since the spirit came I´ve not been the same I just want to give you thanks</lyrics>
