<lyrics>[V1]
 Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
 Hear my humble cry;
 While on others Thou art calling,
 Do not pass me by.

[C1]
   Savior, Savior,
   Hear my humble cry;
   While on others Thou art calling,
   Do not pass me by.

[V2]
 Let me at a throne of mercy
 Find a sweet relief;
 Kneeling there in deep contrition,
 Help my unbelief.

[V3]
 Trusting only in Thy merit,
 Would I seek Thy face;
 Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
 Save me by Thy grace.

[V4]
 Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
 More than life to me;
 Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
 Whom in heav'n but Thee?</lyrics>
