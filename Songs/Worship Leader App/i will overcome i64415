 When the battle that I'm fighting
 Brings me to my knees
 When I feel alone and stranded
 And no one seems to see
 I won't let this valley steal my faith
 Satan won't have victory
 I will stand upon the word of God
 I will overcome with him

[C1]
   I will triumph in the trials
   I will glory in the cross
   I will stand upon the mountain
   Walk through the fire untouched
   Though the world may rise against me
   My strength is in the Lord
   I will be an overcomer, for he has overcome the world.

[V2]
 Problems may be great
 But my God is greater still
 So I'll walk out of this valley
 And proclaim the Fathers will
 When it feels just like the end
 He will open up a door
 I know that I shall overcome
 And be much stronger than before.</lyrics>
