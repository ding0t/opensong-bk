<lyrics>[V1]
 Glorify Him!
 There's none like Him!
 Recognize the faithfulness of God!
 Magnify Him!
 Come beside Him!
 Recognize the graciousness of our God!

[P1]
   Praise God and call on His name! Our lives are never the same...

[C1]
   For the Lord! Lift our voice in one accord!
   You are the one who answers, then and again and after.
   Show us Lord! By faith and through the Word,
   You are the one who leads us; in pain and joy you meet us.

[B1]
   We receive grace upon grace!
   We believe you, Lord! (Now shout it out!)</lyrics>
