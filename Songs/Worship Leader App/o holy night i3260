 O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;

 It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.

 Long lay the world in sin and error pining,

 Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.
.    G                   C
 A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
.      G             C
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

 O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,

 Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.

   The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;

   In all our trials born to be our friends.

 His law is love and His gospel is peace.

 Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.

 And in his name all oppression shall cease.
