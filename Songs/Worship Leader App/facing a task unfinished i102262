<title>Facing a Task Unfinished</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.   C           C/G   G          F         G      C
 Facing a task unfinished that drives us to our knees
.  C/E             F          Dm7                G/B
 A need that, undiminished, rebukes our slothful ease
.    C              F    C/E     Am             Dm7
 We, who rejoice to know Thee, renew before Thy throne
.   C/G              Fmaj7        Dm7    G7sus4    C   Am  F
 The solemn pledge we owe Thee, to go and make Thee known__

[V2]
.      C            C/G   G        F       G         C
 Where other lords beside Thee hold their unhindered sway
.      C/E            F           Dm7             G/B
 Where forces that defied Thee, defy Thee still today
.     C                  F     C/E     Am                  Dm7
 With none to heed their cry - ing for life, and love, and light
.  C/G                Fmaj7     Dm7    G7sus4 C
 Unnumbered souls are dying and pass into the night

[C1]
.     G     F       C          G       F     C
   We go to all the world with kingdom hope unfurled
.     F     G        Em7      Am        Dm7   G          C
   No other name has pow'r to save, but Jesus Christ the Lord

[V3]
.   C                   C/G    G        F        G        C
 We bear the torch that flam - ing fell from the hands of those
.    C/E                  F            Dm7            G/B
 Who gave their lives proclaiming that Jesus died and rose
.     C              F   C/E      Am                Dm7
 Ours is the same commission, the same glad message ours
.      C/G           Fmaj7     Dm7     G7sus4    C
 Fired by the same ambition to Thee we yield our pow'rs

[V4]
.  C             C/G    G       F      G      C
 O Father who sustained them, O Spirit who inspired
.   C/E                   F              Dm7              G/B
 Saviour, whose love constrained them to toil with zeal untired
.     C           F   C/E      Am        Dm7
 From cowardice defend us, from lethargy awake
.     C/G              Fmaj7      Dm7    G7sus4  C
 Forth on Thine errands send us to labour for Thy sake</lyrics>
