<lyrics>[V1]
 He's promised a second ride }
 And has returned to prove His }
 Word; }
 He's here with us who are }
 honest in our hearts. }2x

[V2]
 CHORUS
 He has comeback for the honest in
 heart,
 Who'll lay down their lives,
 Willingly sacrifice;
 He's going back for the honest in
 heart,
 Going back for the honest in heart.

[V3]
 By faith, Rahab the harlot
 Perished not with all the rest;
 For she received the spies with
 peace,
 And she was blessed;
 The token was applied and even }
 though the walls fell down, }
 The spies went back for her, }
 (She was saved) }
 For she was honest in her heart. }2x

[V4]
 On His way to Jerusalem
 He picked up the ones and twos;
 Blind man, Bartimaeus,
 And little Zacchaeus too;
 We've seen Himself repeated }
 In His Bride as she moves on, }
 He's seeking out all the }
 honest in heart. }2x

[V5]
 Our Lord, so rich in mercy,
 Even there upon the cross
 Love burned deep within His heart,
 To reach out for the lost;
 The thief hanging at His side }
 Humbly asked to be }
 And in that hour He reached out}
 for an honest one. }2x

[V6]
 Even, way down in the Philippines,
 As we've heard it testified,
 How the Lord, He did work things
 out,
 For the sake of His little Bride;
 He never forgets His own }
 no matter what the condition, }
 He kept His Word, }
 He reached out for the honest}
 one. }2x</lyrics>
