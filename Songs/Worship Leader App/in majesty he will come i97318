   In majesty He will come
   With the sound of the trumpet
   To claim the redeemed
   In majesty He will come
   Jesus the Savior eternal King
   Every knee in heaven and earth will bow
   To this most Holy One
   In majesty He will come

[V1]
 Born of a mighty God
 Sent from His heavenly throne
 Given to reign over kings and priests
 The sins of man to atone
 The Messiah will return
 The hour unknownto men
 A fanfare of praise will inhabit the earth
 As creation rejoices in Him</lyrics>
