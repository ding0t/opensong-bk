 Invading all my weakness
 You wrapped me up in grace
 The worst of me succeeded by the best of You

[V2]
 My heart is overtaken
 My soul is overwhelmed
 The worst of me succeeded by the best of You

[V3]
 My dreams have found their purpose
 My future in Your hands
 This life would have no meaning
 If it weren't for You

[P1]
   So I lay me down
   For kingdom come
   Steal all that is within me
   'Cause all I want in this world
   Is more of You

[C1]
   In the less of me it is You
   Increasing as I fade away
   Your light for all the world to see

[C2]
   God it is You who breaks the chains
   It is You who lights the way
   And everything I am cries out for You

[V4]
 Lord make my life transparent
 Your life in mine displayed
 Let every earthly glory go back to You

[B1]
   Woah

[P2]
   So I lay me down
   So I lay me down</lyrics>
