<lyrics>[V1]
. C                       G/B
 When I feel the cold of winter
.                   F/A
 And this cloak of sadness

[V2]
.         C
 I need You
.C                          G/B
 All the evil things that shake me
.                     F/A
 All the words that break me
.        C
 I need You

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  Am        Em
   Over the mountains
.  Dm      Am
   Over the sea
.   Am           Em/G
   Here You come running
.      F       C
   My Lover to me

[V3]
 Verse:
 Do not hide me from Your presence
 Pull me from these shadows
 I need You
 Beauty wrap Your arms around me
 Sing Your song of kindness
 I need You

[C2]
   Bridge:
.  Am             Em
   Oh through the valleys
.  Dm                   Am
   Through the dark of night
.  Am            Em/G
   Here You come running
.      F                 C
   To hold me until it's light

[V4]
 Refrain:
.C
  I'll come running
.           Bb
 I'll come running
.           F
 I'll come running
.         C
