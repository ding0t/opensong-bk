 Super Star Billy Brown,

[V3]
 Whatcha' doing to this town?

.                 A5 G D
 Wants to be like you

[V4]

 All of your adoring fans,

 Sitting in the seats and stands

 Listening to every word you say
.                    A5 G D
 And watching every move

[V6]
 PRE-Chorus:
.B                      C#
 Once I saw a sign that said

 &quot;Billy Brown for President&quot;

[V7]
 Chorus:
.           D            A
 It ain't easy being a star
.           D                  A
 It ain't easy to be who you are
.           D                     F#
 It ain't easy but you're going far
.          B
 Well, you say there's nothing to it
.         D                  A5
 But somebody's gotta do it, boy

 Super Star Billy Brown
.A5                       G  D
 Stop and listen to the crowd
.D5
 Everywhere you go
.                               A5  G D
 Everybody's screaming out your name

[V9]
 PRE-Chorus:
.B                       C#
 Do they know the reason why
.               F#     E      D
 You point your finger to the sky

[V10]
 REPEAT Chorus:

[V11]
.BRIDGE:
 F#
 We all are watching and expect
.B
  That whatever you are doing next
.E               D            A
  Well, it is gonna be the greatest thing
.     G#
 That we have ever seen
