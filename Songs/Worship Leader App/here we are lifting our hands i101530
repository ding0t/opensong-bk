   Here we are
   Lifting our hands to You
   Here we are
   Giving You thanks for all You do
   And as we praise
   And worship Your holy name
   You are here
   Dwelling within our praise

[V1]
 For every answered prayer
 For always being there
 For love that hears us when we call
 For arms that lift us when we fall
 You have always been
 Right beside us, leading us all along the way
 And we made it through
 Because of You

[C2]
   And here we are
   Lifting our hands to You
   Here we are
   Giving You thanks for all You do
   And as we praise
   And worship Your holy name
   You are here
   Dwelling within our praise

[V2]
 For days we cannot see (for days we cannot see)
 For all that yet to be (so much is yet to be)
 The trials we may have to face
 When we'll be leaning on your grace
 It will be your strength
 That saves us
 Your love that makes us strong
 And through it all (through it all)
 We'll sing this song

[C3]
   Here we are
   Lifting our hands to You
   Here we areGiving You thanks for all You do
   As we praise
   And worship Your holy name
   You are here
   Dwelling within our praise
   You are here
   Dwelling within our praise
   You are here
   Dwelling within our praise</lyrics>
