<lyrics>[C1]
   Rising up, rising up,
   Ther's a new testment church rising up
   Rising up, rising up,
   Ther's a new testment church rising up

[V1]
 As I looked out accross the land,
 I see God's mighty hand
 A Bride of Christ adorned in wedding gown.
 Just like in the days of old
 They stood with courrag bold.
 They turned this old world upside down.

[V2]
 Now the bible plainly tells
 how the Holy Ghost fell
 Signs and wonders were done
 by the appostles hands
 Demon spirits were cast out
 And in jail the sung and shout
 while surrounded
 by God's holy Angel band

[V3]
 Well if you think it's all long gone
 and the miracles are done.
 I have some good news to bring to you
 In the last days He'll pour
 of His spirit, more and more
 Like a mighty eagle,
 His strength He'll renew.</lyrics>
