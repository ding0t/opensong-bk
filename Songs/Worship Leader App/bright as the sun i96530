<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, how sweet did You gaze

[V2]
 On my perilous heart
 To befriend me to my bitter end
 And carry the burden
 For as graven my failure
 You prevailed in pure love
 To be found in the depths of Your heart
 As good as forgiven
 O how You graced that cross
 Where Jesus died and death took the loss
 Wild as the floodgates of heaven
 Flung wide open within His scars
 Now mine is the life You raised
 Yours the glory that took down that grave
 Bright as the sun almighty in love
 God forever Your Kingdom come
 O how sweet is the sound
 Of a heart drenched in grace
 Rising up from the ashes in praise
 Alive to Your greatness
 Hope as brazen as mercy
 Through the terrible night
 How You blaze through the darkness I fight
 Bright as the morning
 O how You graced that cross
 Where Jesus died and death took the loss
 Wild as the floodgates of heaven
 Flung wide open within His scars
 Now mine is the life You raised
 Yours the glory that took down that grave
 Bright as the sun almighty in love
 God forever Your Kingdom come
 My heart burns wild in my chest
 In awe of Your heart in all that You are
 Let Your praise run wild on my breath
 In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again
 How My heart burns wild in my chest
 In awe of Your heart in all that You are
 Let Your praise run wild on my breath
 In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again
 How My heart burns wild in my chest
 In awe of Your heart in all that You are
 Let Your praise run wild on my breath
 In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again
 Till my heart beats out of my chest
 I'll sing of Your love in awe of Your heart
 Till Your praise is all I have left
 I'll sing of Your love again and again
 Till my heart beats out of my chest
 I'll sing of Your love in awe of Your heart
 Till Your praise is all I have left
 I'll sing of Your love again and again
 How You graced that cross
 Where Jesus died and death took the loss
 Wild as the floodgates of heaven
 Flung wide open within His scars
 Mine is the life You raised
 Yours the glory that took down that grave
 Bright as the sun almighty in love
 God forever Your Kingdom come
 Bright as the sun
 Let us see Your Kingdom come
 Bright as the sun
 Have Your way Your Kingdom come</lyrics>
