<title>My God is so Big</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 // My God is so great
 So strong
 And so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do //

[V2]
 The mountains are His
 The rivers are His
 The stars are His handiwork too

[V3]
 My God is so great
 So strong
 And so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do, for you!</lyrics>
