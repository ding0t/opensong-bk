<lyrics>[V1]
.D
 Sanctify me
.D
 Clean out my closet
.A
 Take away anything
.A                         D
 That is not pleasing to You
.D
 Purify me
.D
 Destroy all my anger
.A
 Wash away everything
.A                         D
 That is not pleasing to You

[C1]
.                G     A
   I will be white as snow
.            D/F#      G
   I will be pure as gold
.            Em          A
   Jesus my heart must know
.                   D
   I'm pleasing to You
.             G       A
   I give my life my all
.              D/F#           G
   Taking the cross I will follow
.             Em          A
   Jesus my heart must know
.                  D
   I'm pleasing to You

[V2]
 Sanctify me
 You are the light to guide me
 To the place where I am
 Only pleasing to You
 Oh come and Purify me
 Lord I need your light inside me
 So the darkness flees
 And I can be pleasing to You</lyrics>
