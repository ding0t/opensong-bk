 My heavenly home
 Is bright and fair,
 I feel like traveling on,
 No pain, nor death
 Can enter there,
 I feel like traveling on.

[C1]
   Yes, I feel like traveling on,
   I feel like traveling on;
   My heavenly home
   Is bright and fair,
   I feel like traveling on.

[V2]
 Its glittering towers
 the sun outshine,
 I feel like traveling on;
 That heavenly mansion
 shall be mine,
 I feel like traveling on.

[V3]
 Let others seek a home below,
 I feel like traveling on;
 Which flames devour,
 Or waves o'er flow,
 I feel like traveling on.

[V4]
 The Lord has been so
 good to me,
 I feel like traveling on;
 Until that blessed home I see,
 I feel like traveling on.</lyrics>
