<lyrics>[V1]
 Broken, mocked and stoned
 was a man hanging from a cross
 with a crown of thorns

[V2]
 Who is He, this man who died for me
 his given Son who was born to die
 so we could be redeemed

[C1]
   He died for you
   He died for me
   He took my pain and he bought my shame
   that day on Calvary
   The bleeding One, Gods only Son
   What kind of man is this
   who walked this road alone
   Jesus

[V3]
 It was supposed to be me
 hanging from that tree
 it was my sin, that crucified him
 I dont deserve any mercy

[V4]
 But as we come to you today
 we remember what you gave
 through His bleeding word
 you have revealed to us our names

[V5]
 I didn't see but I believe</lyrics>
