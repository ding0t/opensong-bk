.        D        A7  D
 When we walk with the Lord
.      A7           D
 In the light of His Word
.        G        D          A   A7
 What a glory He sheds on our way
.        D       A7  D
 While we do His good will
.   A7             D
 He abides with us still
 . G D A7 D
 And with all who will trust and o-bey

[C1]
.  A7         D
   Trust and obey
.             B7       Em
   For there's no other way
.        A7       D
   To be happy in Jesus
.  D       A7      A7 D
   But to trust and o-bey

[V2]
.       D    A7 D
 Not a burden we bear
.      A7       D
 Not a sorrow we share
.        G           D        A   A7
 But our toil He doth richly repay
.       D     A7 D
 Not a grief or a loss
.     A7         D
 Not a frown or a cross
.      G             D        A7 D
 But is blessed if we trust and o-bey

[V3]
.        D   A7  D
 But we never can prove
.      A7           D
 The delights of His love
.      G           D      A  A7
 Until all on the altar we lay
.         D   A7 D
 For the favor He shows
.        A7       D
 And the joy He bestows
.        G            D        A7 D
 Are for them who will trust and o-bey

[V4]
.              A7  D
 Then in fellowship sweet
.        A7        D
 We will sit at His feet
.         G           D          A  A7
 Or we'll walk by His side in the way
.        D      A7   D
 What He says we will do
.        A7            D
 Where He sends we will go
.      G         D        A7 D
 Never fear, only trust and o-bey</lyrics>
