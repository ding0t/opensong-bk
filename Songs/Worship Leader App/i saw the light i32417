[V2]
 [Verse 1]
.G
 I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
.C                             G
 I wouldn't let my dear savior in
.G
 Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[V3]
 [Chorus]
.G
 I saw the light, I saw the light
.C                         G
 No more darkness, no more night
.G
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light
.G D G
  

[V4]
 [Verse 2]
.G
 Just like a blind man I wandered along
.C                                  G
 Worries and fears I claimed for my own
.G
 Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[V5]
 [Chorus]
.G
 I saw the light, I saw the light
.C                         G
 No more darkness, no more night
.G
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light

 [Verse 3]
.G
 I was a fool to wander and stray
.C                                       G
 For straight is the gate and narrow the way
.G
 Now I have traded the wrong for the right
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[V10]
 [Chorus]
.G
 I saw the light, I saw the light
.C                         G
 No more darkness, no more night
.G
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
.G                D         G
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light
