<lyrics>[V1]
.G                  Am           C
 What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
.G                  G       D
 Leaning on the everlasting arms;
.G                   Am              C
 What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
.G                      D7  G
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[C1]
.          C        G               D    G    D
   Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms;
.  G        C        G                      D7  G
   Leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.</lyrics>
