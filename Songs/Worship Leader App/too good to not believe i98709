.             F                                       C
 I've lived stories that have proved your faithfulness
.           Am                            G
 I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend
.           F                          Am
 There is beauty in what I can't understand
.              C
 Jesus, it's You

 Jesus, it's You

   All the miracles I've seen
.                       F
   Too good to not believe

   You're the wonder-working God
.                             C
   And You heal because You love
.                          G
   Oh the miracles we'll see

[V2]
.         F                            C
 I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
.               Am                                 G
 But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead
.          F                         Am
 All the glory to the only one who can
.              C
 Jesus, it's You

 Jesus, it's You
