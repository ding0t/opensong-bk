<lyrics>[V1]
 We choose the fear of the Lord
 We choose the fear of the Lord
 For the fear of the Lord is to hate all evil
 We choose the fear of the Lord
 We choose the fear of the Lord

[V2]
 We choose the way of the Lord
 We choose the way of the Lord
 For the way of the Lord is the way of wisdom
 We choose the way of the Lord
 We choose the way of the Lord

[C1]
   He who delights in the Word of the Lord
   Shall be blessed in all of his ways
   For the friendship of God is with those who fear Him
   So we choose the fear of the Lord
   We choose the Word of the Lord

[V3]
 We choose the Word of the Lord
 We choose the Word of the Lord
 For the Word of the Lord shall endure forever
 We choose the Word of the Lord
 We choose the Word of the Lord</lyrics>
