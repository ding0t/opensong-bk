<title>Come Alive (Dry Bones)</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Through the eyes of men it seems
 There's so much we have lost
 As we look down the road
 Where all the prodigals have walked
 One by one
 The enemy has whispered lies
 And led them off as slaves

[V2]
 But we know that you are God
 Yours is the victory
 We know there is more to come
 That we may not yet see
 So with the faith you've given us
 We'll step into the valley unafraid, yeah

[V3]
 As we call out to dry bones
 Come alive, come alive
 We call out to dead hearts
 Come alive, come alive
 Up out of the ashes
 Let us see an army rise
 We call out to dry bones, come alive

[V4]
 God of endless mercy
 God of unrelenting love
 Rescue every daughter
 Bring us back the wayward son
 And By your spirit breathe upon them
 Show the world that you alone can save
 You alone can save

[V5]
 As we call out to dry bones
 Come alive, come alive
 We call out to dead hearts
 Come alive, come alive
 Up out of the ashes
 Let us see an army rise
 We call out to dry bones come alive

[V6]
 So breathe, oh breath of God
 Now breathe, oh breath of God
 Breathe, oh breath of God
 Now breathe

[V7]
 Breathe, oh breath of God
 Now breathe, oh breath of God
 Breathe, oh breath of God, now breathe

[V8]
 As we call out to dry bones
 Come alive, come alive
 We call out to dead hearts
 Come alive, come alive
 Up out of the ashes
 Let us see an army rise
 We call out to dry bones come alive, yeah
 We call out to dry bones, come alive</lyrics>
