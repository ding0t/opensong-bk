 There's only One strong enough to save
 There's only One who overcame the grave
 There's only One who's worthy of all praise
 And in His hands, the keys of death and hell
 And in His name, a power that can heal
 And by His blood, our sins are washed away

[C1]
   His name is Jesus
   His name is Jesus
   His name is Wonderful
   Counselor, Almighty God!

[V2]
 Nations kneel
 And glorify the Lord!
 Let all the earth
 Tremble for He comes!
 And He will judge the living and the dead!
 The Son of Man coming on the clouds
 With trumpet sound and every knee will bow
 And tongue confess the Name above all names!

[B1]
   HE IS COUNSELOR!
   HE IS MIGHTY GOD!
   HE'S THE PRINCE OF PEACE!
   THE OMNIPOTENT!
   HE IS WONDERFUL!
   HE IS RADIANT!
   THE ALMIGHTY GOD!

[B2]
   We worship You
   We give our lives to You
   We sing out
   We cry out</lyrics>
