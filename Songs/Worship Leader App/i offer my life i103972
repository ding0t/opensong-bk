<lyrics>[V1]
.E              A
 All that I am, all that I have
.B                       F#m     E
 I lay them down before You, O Lord
.C#m             A
 All my regrets, all my acclaim
.F#m                E         A           B
 the joy and the pain I'm making them Yours

[V2]
 Chorus
.E                  C#m
 Lord, I offer my life to You

 Everything I've been through

 Use it for Your glory

 Lord, I offer my days to You

 Lifting my praise to You

 Lord, I offer You my life

 Verse2
.E                   A
 Things in the past, things yet unseen
.B                          A             E
 Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
.C#m              A
 All of my hopes, all of my plans
.F#m               E        A        B
 My heart and my hand are lifted to You

[V4]
 Bridge
.C            D        Bm             Em
 What can we give that You have not given
.     Am           D         Bm           Em
 And what do we have that is not already Yours
.Am           D            Bm          E
 All we possess are these lives we're living
.     Am              G        B
 And that's what we give to You</lyrics>
