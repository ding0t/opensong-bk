<lyrics>[V1]
 I will sing the wondrous story
 Of the Christ who died for me.
 How He left His home in glory
 For the cross of Calvary.
 I was lost, but Jesus found me,
 Found the sheep that went astray,
 Threw His loving arms around me,
 Drew me back into His way.

[V2]
 I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;
 Faint was I from many a fall;
 Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
 But He freed me from them all.
 Days of darkness still come o'er me,
 Sorrow's paths I often tread,
 But the Savior still is with me;
 By His hand I'm safely led.

[V3]
 He will keep me till the river
 Rolls its waters at my feet;
 Then He'll bear me safely over,
 Where the loved ones I shall meet.
 Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
 Of the Christ who died for me,
 Sing it with the saints in glory,
 Gathered by the crystal sea.</lyrics>
