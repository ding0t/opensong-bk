<lyrics>[V1]
.C                   F     C
 In my wrestling and in my doubts
.F     C            G
 In my failures You won't walk out
.C                    F       C
 Your great love will lead me through
.F            C           G        C
  You are the peace in my troubled sea
.F            C           G        C
  You are the peace in my troubled sea

[V2]
 In the silence, You won't let go
 In the questions, Your truth will hold
 Your great love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 You are the peace in my troubled sea

[C1]
.  F        C     Am       G
   My lighthouse, my lighthouse
.  F                C       Am             G
   Shining in the darkness. I will follow You
.  F        C     Am       G
   My lighthouse, my lighthouse
.  F                   C
   I will trust the promise
.  Am               G         F C G
   You will carry me safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
.           F C G
   Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
.           F C G
   Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
.            C
   Safe to shore

[V3]
 I won't fear what tomorrow brings
 With each morning I'll rise and sing
 My God's love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 You are the peace in my troubled sea

[B1]
   Fire before us your the brightest,
   You will lead us through the storms.
   Fire before us your the brightest,
   You will lead us through the storms.(Hey)
   Fire before us your the brightest,
   You will lead us through the storms.
   Fire before us your the brightest,
   You will lead us through the storms.</lyrics>
