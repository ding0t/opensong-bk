 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,

 Is laid for your faith in His ex__cellent word!

 What more can He say than to you He hath said,
.   G   C       G Em      G/D D7       G
 To you who for refuge to Je__sus hath fled.

 Upheld by My righteous, omni__potent hand.&quot;

 &quot;When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
.    G C       G  Em        G/D D7  G
 The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;

 &quot;When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,

 My grace, all sufficient shall be  thy supply;

 Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.&quot;

 &quot;The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
.  G    C      G    Em    G/D  D7     G
 I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
.     G                Em            G         D
 That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
.     G C       G Em      G/D D7     G
 I'll never, no never, no ne__ver forsake!&quot;</lyrics>
