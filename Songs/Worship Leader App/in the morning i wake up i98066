 // In the morning I wake up, I call out to You.
 Joyfully, I sing to You; My praise is for You. //

[P1]
   My song to You, is what You long for.
   My life to You alone devoted.
   All day long, it's You I'm praising
   Flooded with love, my whole soul worships

[C1]
   //// O Isa, (O Isa), O Isa, Isa, O Isa
   Come to me right now my Lord,
   I long for You! ////

[B1]
   I love You Lord, O King of Kings, You are my God!</lyrics>
