 Here we are
.                          E  B E
 Gathered together as a family
. A
 Bound as one Lifting up our voices
.          E       B E
 To the King of kings
 We cry

[C1]

   Abba, Father, worthy is Your name
.  C#m   G#m       F#m      B      E
   Abba, Father, worthy is Your name

[V2]
 Here we are
 Singing together as a family
 Bound as one
 Lifting up our voices
 To the King of kings
 We sing

[C2]
   Abba, Father, holy is Your name
   Abba, Father, holy is Your name</lyrics>
