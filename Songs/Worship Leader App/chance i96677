 Intro:
.Bm  A5 Em
 G G/F# Em

[V2]
 Chorus:

[V3]
.Em Bm
 People watching, every life a mystery
 Sunny faces, but you know the story's incomplete
 Satisfaction. seems a million miles away
 But I'm moving (in) to another state of mind
 I'm believing there's no better place or better time

[V4]
.Bm  A5 Em
 Everyday we live, there's a chance to give
.G G/F# Em
 Everytime we speak, there's a chance for peace
 Everyday we live, there's a chance

[V5]
 Little sister, put aside your fear and breath
 In the secret, so you hear the voice of heaven
 (sayin') Come together, hope is stronger than it seems
 Where you're standing there's no running out on love
 Only human, but you've set your eyes on things above

[V6]
 A chance for you, a chance for me
 A chance to serve in a time of need
 A chance to live, a chance to touch
 A chance to live, a chance to tell
 A chance to pray for a father's love
 A chance to lose yourself for somebody else
 Or a chance top pray for the chance to love

[V7]
