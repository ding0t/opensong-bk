<lyrics>[V1]
 I woke up this morning feeling fine I woke up with heaven on my mind
 I woke up with joy in my soul cause I knew my Lord had control
 I knew I was walkin' in the light cause I'd been on my knees in the night
 And I'd pray till the Lord gave a sign and now I'm feeling mighty fine

[C1]
   Well I'm feeling mighty fine I've got heaven on my mind
   Don't you know I want to go where the milk and honey flow
   There's a light that always shines deep inside this heart of mine
   I've got heaven on my mind and I'm feeling mighty fine

[V2]
 We're walking with Jesus all the time we're walking and talking as we climb
 We're traveling a road to the sky where I know I'll live when I die
 He's been telling me all about that land and he tells me that everything is grand
 And he says that a home will be mine and now I'm feeling mighty fine</lyrics>
