<lyrics>[V1]
 Praise Him, praise Him,
 Praise Him in the morning,
 Praise Him in the noon-time,
 Praise Him, praise Him,
 Praise Him when the
 sun goes down.

[V2]
 Love Him, love Him,
 Love Him in the morning,
 Love Him in the noon-time.
 Love Him, love Him,
 Love Him when the
 sun goes down.

[V3]
 Serve Him, serve Him,
 Serve Him in the morning,
 Serve Him in the noon-time.
 Serve Him, serve Him,
 Serve Him when the
 sun goes down

[V4]
 Thank Him, thank Him,
 Thank Him in the morning,
 Thank Him in the noon-time.
 Thank Him, thank Him,
 Thank Him when the
 sun goes down.</lyrics>
