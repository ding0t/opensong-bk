 This is the day, this is the day.
 That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made.
 We will rejoice, we will rejoice,
 And be glad in it, and be glad in it.

[C1]
   This is the day that the Lord has made.
   We will rejoice and be glad in it.
   This is the day, this is the day
   That the Lord has made.

[V2]
 We are the sons, we are the sons,
 Of the living God, of the living God.
 We will rejoice, we will rejoice,
 And be glad in Him, and be glad in Him.

[C2]
   We are the sons of the living God.
   We will rejoice and be glad in Him.
   We are the sons, we are the sons
   Of the living God.</lyrics>
