[V2]
 The light that shines is the light of love
 I'm gonna let it shine
 The light that shines is the light of love
 I'm gonna let it shine
 The light that shines is the light of love
 I'm gonna let it shine
 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

[V3]
 It shines on me and it shines on you
 I'm gonna let it shine
 It shines on me and it shines on you
 I'm gonna let it shine
 It shines on me and it shines on you
 I'm gonna let it shine
 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

[V4]
 Let it shine till Jesus comes
 I'm gonna let it shine
 Let it shine till Jesus comes
 I'm gonna let it shine
 Let it shine till Jesus comes
 I'm gonna let it shine
 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

[B1]
.     G
   On Monday he gave me the gift of love,
.  C
   Tuesday peace came from above.
.     G
   On Wednesday he told me to have more faith,
.     D7
   on Thursday he gave me a little more grace.
.     G
   On Friday he told me just to watch and pray,
.     C
   on Saturday he told me just what to say,
.     G
   on Sunday he gave me the pow'r divine
.     D7                  F
   to let my little light shine.</lyrics>
