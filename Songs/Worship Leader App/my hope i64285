   My hope is in the Lord,
   from this time on
   and ever more.
   Oh, my hope is in the Lord
   forever more.

[V1]
 I stand in awe within
 the presence of the Lord,
 in whom the wisdom of the ages lies.
 For whom the raging of the sea subsides,
 the living sacrifice, the only source of life.

[V2]
 His tender mercies come
 with every rising sun.
 To meet the sinner in his brokeness.
 To offer healing and forgiveness.
 And those who trust in him,
 Will find their hearts at rest

[C2]
   Mitt håp står til min Gud
   fra denne dag
   til evig tid
   Åh, mitt håp står til min Gud
   til evig tid</lyrics>
