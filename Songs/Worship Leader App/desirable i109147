<lyrics>[V1]
 What did You see in me
 To love me the way You do?
 So much patience
 So much mercy
 You made me desirable to You

[V2]
 Before I ever told You yes, You chose me
 So much grace that I could not resist
 I heard You say my name
 You bought me with Your blood
 You made me desirable to You

[C1]
   Draw me to You, Lord, to the chambers of Your love
   It's the place where I am one with You
   Draw me to You, Lord, to the center of Your heart
   It's the place where I belong in You</lyrics>
