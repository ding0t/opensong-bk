 You call the sun to rise
 And You lay it down to rest
 You hold this heart of mine
 And You hold my every breath

[V2]
 Such an awesome God
 So mighty
 So holy
 So wonderful
 Such an awesome God
 So selfless
 So generous
 So faithful, You are

[V3]
 Seated in majesty

[V4]
 Reigning in holiness
 The table is set for me
 For You are the living bread

[V5]
 Such an awesome God
 So mighty
 So holy
 So wonderful
 Such an awesome God
 So selfless
 So generous
 So faithful, You are

[V6]
 And nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty
 Nothing as sweet as His love and mercy
 Nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty
 And nothing as sweet as Your love and mercy
 Oh, nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty (oh)
 Nothing as sweet as His love and mercy
 Oh, nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty
 Nothing as sweet as Your love and mercy
 There's nothing sweeter, sweeter than Your love, Jesus
 Jesus, the son of God
 Hung on a cross to die
 But not even death itself
 Could hold You down, for You rose to life

[V7]
 Such an awesome God

[V8]
 So mighty
 So holy
 So wonderful
 Such an awesome God
 So selfless
 So generous
 So faithful
 You are faithful to me</lyrics>
