<lyrics>[V1]
 Shackled by a heavy burden
 'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
 Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
 And now I am no longer the same.

[C1]
   He touched me,
   Oh, He touched me,
   And oh, the joy
   That floods my soul!
   Something happened,
   And now I know,
   He touched me,
   And made me whole.

[V2]
 Since I met this blessed Saviour,
 Since He cleansed
 And made me whole,
 I shall never cease to praise Him,
 I'll shout it while eternity rolls.</lyrics>
