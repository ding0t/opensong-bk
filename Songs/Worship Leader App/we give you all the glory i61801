<lyrics>[V1]
 I just want to lift
 my hands to You, Lord
 You are a wonderful God
 Miraculous King
 Fill this place with all
 Your Holy Presence
 and pour Your power on us
 as we seek more of You

[P1]
   // I believe in You
   and what You'll do in me //
   in me...in me

[C1]
   We give You
   all, all the glory
   We give You
   all, all the honor
   Amazing Son of God.</lyrics>
