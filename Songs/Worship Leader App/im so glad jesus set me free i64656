<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm so glad
 Jesus set me free,
 I'm so glad
 Jesus set me free,
 I'm so glad
 Jesus set me free,
 singing glory, hallelujah,
 Jesus set me free.

[V2]
 I'm so glad Jesus lifted me,
 I'm so glad Jesus lifted me,
 I'm so glad Jesus lifted me,
 Singing, glory, hallelujah,
 Jesus set me free.

[V3]
 I'm on my way to heaven
 shouting victory
 I'm on my way to heaven
 shouting victory
 singing glory, hallelujah,
 Jesus set me free.

[V4]
 Satan had me bound,
 but Jesus set me free
 Satan had me bound,
 but Jesus set me free
 singing glory, hallelujah,
 Jesus set me free.</lyrics>
