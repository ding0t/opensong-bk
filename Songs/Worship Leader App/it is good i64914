<lyrics>[V1]
 It Is Good To Praise The Lord
 And Make Music To Your Name
 O God Most High
 To Proclaim Your Love And Faithfulness
 All The Day And Through The Night

[V2]
 Lai Lai Lai
 Lai Lai Lai Lai Lai...

[V3]
 May I Dwell In Your Courts O Lord
 Then To Flourish Like The Trees Of Lebanon
 Planted In The House Of Adonai
 There To Live Forever more</lyrics>
