<lyrics>[V1]
 Peace of God cover me
 cover me, cover me.
 Peace of God, cover me,
 Through the storm, cover me.

[C1]
   Only in You I am safe
   Only in You I'm secure
   Only in You I find peace
   So Cover me, cover me.

[B1]
   Cover me when I am hurting
   Cover me when I'm not strong
   Cover me when I am going through the storm
   Cover me when all seems hopeless
   Cover me when my faith is gone
   Let the Peace that passes all I understand
   Cover Me, cover Me.</lyrics>
