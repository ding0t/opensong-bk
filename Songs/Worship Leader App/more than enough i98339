 Beyond all my wildest dreams
 Your grace is alive in me
 I'm caught in the overflow
 Of mercy that won't let go

[C1]
   Here on this holy ground
   Standing before You now
   Jesus
   You are more than enough
   If there's one thing I know
   It's how You love me so
   Jesus
   You are more than enough for me

[V2]
 Finally my eyes can see
 You've never abandoned me
 I'm held by the kindness of
 A Father who won't give up
 My Father, You'll never give up

[C2]
   Forever strong
   Forever faithful
   All my life, You are enough for me
   In every storm
   In every battle
   All my life, You are enough for me

[B1]
   You are more than enough for me
   Fear could never conquer me
   Cause You already have, you already have
   Worry could never conquer me</lyrics>
