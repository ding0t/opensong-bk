<title>Bound For The Promised Land</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
 And cast a wishful eye,
 Toward Canaan's fair and happy land,
 Where my possessions lie.

[C1]
   I am bound for the promised land,
   I am bound for the promised land;
   Oh who will come and go with me?
   I am bound for the promised land.

[V2]
 O'er all those wide extended plains
 Shines one eternal day;
 There God the Son forever reigns,
 And scatters night away.

[V3]
 No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
 Can reach that healthful shore;
 Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
 Are feared and felt no more.

[V4]
 When shall I reach that happy place,
 And be forever blest!
 When shall I see my Father's face,
 And in His bosom rest?</lyrics>
