 God be with you till we meet again!
 By His counsels guide, uphold you,
 With His sheep securely fold you;
 God be with you till we meet again!

[C1]
   Till we meet! till we meet!
   Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
   Till we meet! till we meet!
   God be with you till we meet again!

[V2]
 God be with you till we meet again!
 'Neath His wings securely hide you,
 Daily manna still provide you;
 God be with you till we meet again!

[V3]
 God be with you till we meet again!
 When life's perils thick confound you,
 Put His arms unfailing round you;
 God be with you till we meet again!

[V4]
 God be with you till we meet again!
 Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
 Smite death's threat'ning wave before
 you'
 God lie with you till we meet again!</lyrics>
