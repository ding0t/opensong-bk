 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
 And wonder how He could love me,
 A sinner condemned, unclean.

[C1]
   How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
   How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!

[V2]
 For me it was in the garden,
 He prayed: &quot;Not my will, but Thine.&quot;
 He had no tears for His own griefs,
 But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

[V3]
 In pity angels beheld Him,
 And came from the world of light
 To strengthen Him in the sorrows
 He bore for my soul that night.

[V4]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
 And suffered, and died alone.

[V5]
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see,
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me.</lyrics>
