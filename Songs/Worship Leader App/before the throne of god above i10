.C         F/C C
 Before the throne of God above
.                           Em
 I have a strong, a perfect plea;
.             F             G        Am
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
.C        F      C   Dm7   F   C
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.
.           F             G
 My name is graven on His hands,
.C           F             Am
 My name is written on His heart;
.C           F                  Am
 I know that while in heaven He stands
.              F             G C   G Am F C G Am F
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[V2]
.           C         F/C   C
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
.                             Em
 And tells me of the guilt within,
.         F          G      Am
 Upward I look, and see Him there
.C           F   C   Dm7 F  C
 Who made an end of all my sin.
.            F               G
 Because the sinless Saviour died,
.C         F               Am
 My sinful soul is counted free;
.C            F             Am
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
.           F       G      Bb Am Bb F G
 To look on Him and pardon me.

[V3]
.           C          F/C   C
 Behold Him there! the risen Lamb!
.                               Em
 My perfect, spotless, Righteousness,
.            F       G     Am
 The great unchangeable I AM,
.C           F   C  Dm7 F    C
 The King of glory and of grace!
.            F              G
 One with Himself, I cannot die;
.C          F                Am
 My soul is purchased by His blood;
.C          F                  Am
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.                F       G      C   G Am F C G Am F
 With Christ, my Saviour and my God.</lyrics>
