.     A5
 Come praise and glorify our God the Father of our Lord

 In Christ He has in heav'nly realms, His blessings on us poured
.    F#m      A         D                F#m      A     D
 For pure and blameless in His sight, He destined us to be
.    A              Em7                 D            A
 And now we've been adopted through His Son eternally

[C1]
.         F#m            E
   To the praise of Your glory
.         A                        D
   To the praise of Your mercy and grace
.         F#m            E
   To the praise of Your glory
.  G       D       A
   You are the God who saves

.   A                Em7          D                     A
 In Him our sins are washed away, redeemed through sacrifice
.   F#m     A        D               F#m     A      D
 In Him God has made known to us the myst'ry of His will
.     A                    Em7             D                 A
 That Christ should be the head of all His purpose to fulfill

[V3]
.     A5
 Come praise and glorify our God for we've believed the Word
.    A5
 And through our faith we have a seal the Spirit of the Lord
.    F#m    A     D               F#m   A          D
 The Spirit guarantees our hope until redemption's done
.   A             Em7               D
 Until we join in endless praise to God the Three in One</lyrics>
