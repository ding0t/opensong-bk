<lyrics>[V1]
 As I journey through the land, singing
 as I go,
 Pointing souls to Calvary, to the crimson
 flow,
 Many arrows pierce my soul from
 without, within;
 But my Lord leads me on, through Him
 I must win.

[V2]
 CHORUS
 Oh, I want to see Him, look upon His face,
 There to sing forever of His saving grace;
 On the streets of Glory let me lift my
 voice;
 Cares all past, home at last, ever to
 rejoice.

[V3]
 When in service for my Lord, dark may
 be the night,
 But I'll cling more close to Him, He will
 give me light;
 Satan's snares may vex my soul, turn my
 thoughts aside;
 But my Lord goes ahead, leads whate'er
 betide.

[V4]
 When in valleys low I look toward the
 mountain height.
 And behold my Saviour there, leading
 in the fight,
 With a tender hand outstretched toward
 the valley low;
 Guiding me, I can see, as I onward go.

[V5]
 When before me billows rise from the
 mighty deep,
 Then my Lord directs my bark, He doth
 safely keep,
 And He leads me gently on through this
 world below;
 He's a real Friend to me, O I love Him so.</lyrics>
