 I need You here
 I need You here
 You're like the rain that falls
 Fall on this heart and make me new

[V2]
 I look to You
 I look to You
 You're king king above the earth
 And You have put heaven in my heart

[V3]
 I only want to be where You are

[V4]
 Holy, holy is the Lord king of glory
 Forever saviour of the world

[V5]
 Though mountains may be moved
 And fall into the raging seas
 You'll never let me fall
 You hold me in Your nail-scared hands</lyrics>
