<lyrics>[V1]
 Bigger than all the shadows that fall across my path,
 God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.
 He's bigger than all the confusion, bigger than anything;
 God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.

[V2]
 Chorus
 He's bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my fears;
 God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.
 Oh, yes, he's bigger than all my questions, bigger than anything;
 God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.

[V3]
 He's bigger than all the giants of pain and unbelief;
 God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.
 He's bigger than any discouragement, bigger than anything;
 My God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see</lyrics>
