 CORNERSTONE

[V2]
 capo 5th fret

[V3]
.Am                        Dm        E7
 i lay in zion for a foundation, a stone
.Am                        Dm        E7
 i lay in zion for a foundation, a stone
.  Dm               Am
 a tried stone, a precious cornerstone,
.             E7                 Am
 a sure foundation, a sure foundation;
.  Dm               Am
 a tried stone, a precious cornerstone,
.          E7                              Am
 he that believeth shall, shall not make haste.</lyrics>
