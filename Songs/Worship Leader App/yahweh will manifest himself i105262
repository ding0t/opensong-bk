 Your glory is tangible in this place
 Lord, You're doing something great
 Awaken supernatural faith

[C1]
   Yahweh, Rapha, Elohim, Shaddai
   Jireh, Adonai, will manifest Himself

[B1]
   If you worship He will manifest Himself
   If you call Him He will manifest Himself
   If you seek Him He will manifest Himself

[B2]
   Yahweh will manifest Himself
   Jireh will manifest Himself
   Rapha will manifest Himself
   Will manifest Himself</lyrics>
