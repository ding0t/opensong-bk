<lyrics>[V1]
 If I climbed up to the sky
 Where nothing else could ever find
 Your love reaches
 Your love reaches me

[V2]
 If I descended to the ocean floor
 Fathoms down beneath us
 Your love reaches
 Your love reaches me

[V3]
 Because of what You did that day
 Because Your love has made a way
 Your love reaches
 Your love reaches me

[V4]
 Because You tore the veil in two
 Because Your light came breaking through
 Your love reaches
 Your love reaches me

[V5]
 Hallelujah,
 The Lord Almighty reigns
 King forever, and always</lyrics>
