<lyrics>[V1]
.       D          A      D
 Just as I am without one plea
.     A         G                D
 But that thy blood was shed for me
.      D               G
 And that thou bid me come to thee
.   D              A     D
 O Lamb of God I come I come

[V2]
 Just as I am and waiting not
 To rid my soul of one dark blot
 To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
.                         A
 O Lamb of God I come I come

[C1]
.             G            D
   O Lamb of God I come I come
.             G            A
   O Lamb of God I come I come
.             Em             Hm A
   O Lamb of God I come I come__
.            D
   I come I come

[V3]
 Just as I am thou will receive
 To welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
 Because thy promise I believe
 O Lamb of God I come I come

[B1]
.  D        Em      Hm      A      G
   Lamb of God I come I come I come</lyrics>
