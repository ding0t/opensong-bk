<lyrics>[V1]
.        G       G/C     G
 Rock of ages, cleft for me
.        G     G/C       G
 Let me hide myself in thee
.         C              G
 Let the water and the blood
.          C                   G
 From thy wounded side which flowed
.       G       G/C    G
 Be of sin the double cure
.            G        D       G
 Save from wrath and make me pure

[V2]
.         G     G/C    G
 Not the labors of my hands
.        G       G/C      G
 Can fulfill the laws commands
.           C             G
 Should my passion never fade
.       C                G
 And my efforts all be weighed
.        G         G/C   G
 All for sin could not atone
.          G        D    G
 You must save and you alone

[C1]
.          Em   G
   Rock of ages
.          C          G
   No one takes your life
.           C                 G
   Yet you died that I might live
.           C               Em
   Costly grace you freely give
.          C    G
   Rock of ages
.            Am        Em
   You have paid the price
.             C             G
   You were cleft to cover me
.          C               G
   Let me hide myself in thee

[V3]
.        G     G/C      G
 Nothing in my hand I bring
.       G       [G/C      G
 Simply to the c]ross I cling
.       C                 G
 Naked come to thee for dress
.          C                 G
 Helpless look to thee for grace
.         G      G/C      G
 Wretched to the fount I fly
.         G     D     G
 Wash me Savior or I die

[B1]
.        Em      G     C       G
   And while I draw my final breath
.        Em    G         D
   I'll rest upon your grace
.       Em      G      C        G
   And when I close my eyes in death
.        Em      G        D
   I'll wake to see your face</lyrics>
