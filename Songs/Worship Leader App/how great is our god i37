<title>How Great Is Our God</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.    G
 The splendor of the King,
.Em
 Clothed in majesty,
.                    C
 Let all the earth rejoice,
.                D
 All the earth rejoice.
.   G
 He wraps Himself in light,
.    Em
 And darkness tries to hide
.                    C
 And trembles at His voice,
.                D
 Trembles at His voice.

[C1]
.      G
   How great is our God, sing with me,
.      Em
   How great is our God, all will see
.      C          D            G
   How great, how great is our God.

[V2]
.G
 Age to age He stands,
.    Em
 And time is in His hands,
.                  C
 Beginning and the end,
.                  D
 Beginning and the end.
.    G
 The Godhead, three in one
.Em
 Father Spirit Son.
.                 C
 The Lion and the Lamb,
.                 D
 The Lion and the Lamb.

[B1]
.  G
   Name above all names,
.  Em
   Worthy of all praise,
.     C
   My heart will sing
.      D            G
   How great is our God.</lyrics>
