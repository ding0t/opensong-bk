 I'VE READ IN THE BIBLE HOW SAINTS IN THE PAST
 HELD FAST TO GOD'S PROMISE WITH THEIR FAITH PUT TO TEST
 I KNOW THEY HAD HOLD OF A POWERFUL HAND
 AND IN THE MIDST OF THE STORMS WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN
 THEY FOUND STRENGTH TO STAND.

[C1]
   SO LET THE FLOOD WATERS ROLL LET THE STORM WINDS BLOW
   LET EVERYTHING HELL HAS TEAR AT MY SOUL
   IT MAY HINDER ME BRING ME DOWN ON MY KNEES
   BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS I'LL GO NOT A BATTLES BEEN LOST ON THAT OLD RUGGED CROSS
   I'M GOING TO REACH HEAVEN NO MATTER THE COST THE NEXT MOUNTAIN I CLIMB I JUST MIGHT FIND
   SWEET HEAVEN IN VIEW.

[V2]
 THESE DARK STORMY DAYS THAT WE'RE LIVING IN
 ARE BOUND TO SHAKE US TIME AND AGAIN
 BUT THE SAME GRACE HE GAVE THEM HE HAS GIVEN TO ME
 AND THAT SAME MIGHTY HAND THAT HELPED THEM TO STAND
 STILL GIVES VICTORY</lyrics>
