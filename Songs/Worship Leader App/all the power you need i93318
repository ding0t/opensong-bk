 My God can never fail,
 He's been proved time and again
 Trust Him and see
 He's got all the power you need
 He's never early, never late
 It takes courage, it takes faith
 Trust Him and see
 He's got all the power you need

[C1]
   He saves, forgives, and heals
   Takes back what the devil steals
   My debt's been paid in full
   And every day He does miracles

[V2]
 I got dreams, turn them into plans
 Too big for human hands
 Trust Him and see
 He's got all the power you need
 He's real, He's real
 Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel
 He's real, He's real
 I'm believing for miracles</lyrics>
