 In the land of fadeless day
 Lies the city four-square;
 It shall never pass away,
 And there is no night there.

[V2]
 God shall wipe away all tears;
 There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
 And they count not time by years;
 For there is no night there.

[V3]
 All the gates of pearl are made
 In the city four-square;
 All the streets with gold are laid,
 And there is no night there.

[V4]
 And the gates shall never close
 To the city four-square;
 There life's crystal river flows,
 And there is no night there.

[V5]
 There they need no sunshine bright,
 In that city four-square;
 For the Lamb is all the light,
 And there is no night there.</lyrics>
