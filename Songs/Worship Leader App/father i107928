.F    C
 come closer,
.G    C
 come near
.F       C
 I wanna hear you
.G     C
 whispering
.           F    C
 So Father, come closer,
.G    C
 come near
.F       C
 I wanna let you start
.   G      C
 in me dreaming
.            a
 You know my heart,
.    G
 sometimes
.     C
 it's hard
 for me to reach you
.           a       G
 I let your heart define
.    C
 the ways you speak to me
.             a
 So I let you in,
.       G
 please come.
.   C
 My opened arms await you
.         a       G
 And I am longing for
.      C
 our desires to meet.
.F       C
 I wanna let you start in
.G      C
 me dreaming
.F           C
 We wanna be fully alive
.G           C
 we wanne be fully alive
.F           C
 We wanna be fully alive
.G    C
 with you</lyrics>
