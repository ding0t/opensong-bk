<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, I thirst for you
 There is no one else who satisfies
 And my soul, it longs for you
 Like the deer panting for the water

[V2]
 Oh, now I wait for you
 Take me to your courts of glory
 And fall upon me, Lord
 Give me strength to help me stand
 In this dry and weary land

[V3]
 How we need the river
 How we need the rain
 Living water flow to us
 Again, we pray

[V4]
 Shower down your glory
 Shower down your grace
 Let your holy presence
 Fill this place

[V5]
 Ezekiel 47:6-9
 And he said unto me,
 Son of man, hast thou seen this?
 Then he brought me,
 and caused me to return to the river.

[V6]
 Then said he unto me,
 These waters flow toward the east country,
 and go down into the desert, and go ino the sea:
 and when it enters the sea,
 the waters shall be healed.

[V7]
 And it shall come to pass,
 that every living thing that
 moves wherever the rivers shall come, shall live...

[V8]
 Deep calls unto deep
 Lord we seek to know your glory
 For there is only you
 And our hearts cry Abba Father

[V9]
 Now Lord Jesus come
 May your love and grace restore us
 Breathe upon us Lord
 Let your mercies be brand new
 Let the whole earth worship you

[V10]
 How we need the river
 How we need the rain
 Living water flow to us
 Again, we pray

[V11]
 Shower down your glory
 Shower down your grace
 Let your holy presence
 Fill this place</lyrics>
