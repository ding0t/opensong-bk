<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm caught up in Your presence
 I just want to sit here at Your feet
 I'm caught up in this holy moment
 I never wanna leave

[V2]
 Oh, I'm not here for blessings
 Jesus, You don't owe me anything
 More than anything that You can do
 I just want You

[V3]
 I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
 I'm sorry when I just sang another song
 Take me back to where we started
 I open up my heart to You

[V4]
 I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
 I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough
 Take me back to where we started
 I open up my heart to You

[V5]
 I'm caught up in Your presence
 I just want to sit here at Your feet
 I'm caught up in this holy moment
 I never wanna leave

[V6]
 Oh, I'm not here for blessings
 Jesus, You don't owe me anything
 And more than anything that You can do
 I just want You

[V7]
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else
 Nothing else will do
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else
 Nothing else will do

[V8]
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else
 Nothing else will do
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else, Jesus
 Nothing else will do

[V9]
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else
 Nothing else will do
 I just want You
 Nothing else, nothing else, Jesus
 Nothing else will do

[V10]
 I'm coming back to where we started
 I'm coming back to where we started
 When I first felt Your love
 You're all that matters, Jesus
 You're all that matters
 I'm coming back to what really matters
 Just Your heart
 I just wanna bless Your heart, Jesus

[V11]
 I'm caught up in Your presence
 I just want to sit here at Your feet
 I'm caught up in this holy moment
 I never wanna leave

[V12]
 And oh, I'm not here for blessings
 Jesus, You don't owe me anything
 More than anything that You can do
 Oh, I just want You</lyrics>
