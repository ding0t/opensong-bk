<title>All the Earth Will Sing Your Praises</title>
<lyrics>[C1]
   You lived, You died,
   You said in three days You would rise
   You did, You're alive
   You rule, You reign,
   You said You're coming back again
   I know You will
   and all the earth will sing Your praises

[V1]
 You took, You take our sins away oh God
 You give, You gave Your life away for us
 You came down, You saved us through the cross
 Our hearts are changed because of Your great love</lyrics>
