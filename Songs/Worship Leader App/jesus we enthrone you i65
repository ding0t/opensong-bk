<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus we enthrone You,
 We proclaim You our King,
 Standing here in the midst of us,
 We raise you up with our praise,

[C1]
   And as we worship, build your throne,
   And as we worship, build your throne,
   And as we worship, build your throne,
   Come Lord Jesus and take Your place.</lyrics>
