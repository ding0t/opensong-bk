 THE HAPPY SONG

[V2]
.      G              D
 Well, I could sing unending songs
.   Em                C
 Of how you saved my soul.
.    G               D
 And I could dance a thousand miles
.  Em                   C
 Because of Your great love.

[V3]
.G
 My heart is bursting Lord
.D
 To tell of all You've done:
.Em
 Of how you changed my life
.     C               (D)
 And wiped away the past.
.G
 I wanna shout it out!
.D
 From every rooftop sing,
.Em
 For now I know that God
.    C       (D)
 Is for and not against me... (Chorus)

[V4]
.C                                    G
 Everybody's singing now, 'cause we're so happy.
.C                                     G
 Everybody's dancing now, 'cause we're so happy.
.   Am
 If only we could see Your face
.     C
 And see You smiling over us,
.    Am             C
 And unseen angels celebrate
.                  G
 Hey! The joy is in this place!</lyrics>
