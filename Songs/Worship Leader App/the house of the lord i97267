<lyrics>[V1]
 Better one day in The House of the Lord
 than thousands of years far from Him
 I choose a corner in The House of The Lord
 over the kingdoms of men

[C1]
   Come, go with me to the House of the Lord
   Come, celebrate The Author of Love
   Come, Honour The Name of The One who first loved us
   Being here in The House of the lord
   we bring joy to the heart of Our God
   as we pour out our praise in obedience and love
   In The House of The Lord !

[V2]
 A passionate soul and a passionate love
 cry out to The Giver of Life
 My heart of flesh yearns for His company
 The One Who is Lord over all</lyrics>
