   He´s still working on me To make me what I ought to be
   It took him just a week to make the moon and the stars the sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars
   How loving and patient He must be ´Cause He´s still working on me

[V1]
 There really ought to be a sign upon my heart
 Don´t judge me yet there´s an unfinished part
 But I´ll be perfect just according to His plan
 Fashioned by the Masters loving hand

[V2]
 In the mirror of His word reflections that I see
 Makes me wonder why He never gave up on me
 But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray
 Remember He´s the potter I´m the clay</lyrics>
