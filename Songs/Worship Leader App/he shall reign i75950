<lyrics>[C1]
   He shall reign over all the earth (4x)

[V1]
 There shall come forth a rod out of Jesse
 And a branch shall grow from his roots
 The Spirit of God will rest upon you
 The Spirit of wisdom and truth

[V2]
 You shall not judge with the sight of Your eyes
 Or decide witht he hearing of Your ears
 But with righteousness judge the poor
 And decide with fairness for the meek

[V3]
 You shall gather the outcast of Israel
 The dispersed of Judea from all the earth
 You shall stand as an ensign for Your people
 And Your resting place shall be glorious

[C2]
   Come and reign over all the earth (x4)</lyrics>
