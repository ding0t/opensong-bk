<lyrics>[V1]
.     Em        D   G        C
 There's a place, where mercy reigns and never dies
.     Em        D     G            C
 There's a place, where streams of grace flows deep and wide

[P1]
.       D       C
   All the love, I've ever found
.        D             C
   Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[C1]
.  C
   At the cross, at the cross
.    G
   I surrender my life
.      D           Am
   I'm in awe of you; I'm in awe of you
.      C             G
   Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
.     D           Am
   I owe all to you, I owe all to you
.  C
   Jesus

[V2]
.    Em        D   G          C
 There's a place, where sin and shame are powerless
.    Em      D       G          C
 Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness

[P2]
.       D       C
   All the love, I've ever found
.        D             C
   Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[C2]
.  C
   At the cross, at the cross
.    G
   I surrender my life
.      D           Am
   I'm in awe of you; I'm in awe of you
.      C             G
   Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
.     D           Am
   I owe all to you, I owe all to you
.  C
   Jesus

[B1]
.  C           Em
   Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
.  G         D
   Here I bow down, here I bow down
.  C          Em
   Here arms open wide, here you saved my life
.  G         D
   Here I bow down, here I bow</lyrics>
