.       Em.             C        G
 Why You ever chose me Has always been a mystery
.     Em                                 C      G.
 All my life I've been told I belong at the end of the line
.            Em                   C         G
 With all the other Not-Quites with all the Never-Get-It-Rignts
.      Em.                                                C      G
 But it turns out we're the ones You've been looking for all this time

[C1]
.             Em    C        G
   'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
.         Em     C    G
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
.            Em       C       G
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
.              C      G         D Em
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
.              C      G         D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[V2]
.     Em                 C          G
 Moses had stage fright and David brought a rock to a sword fight
.     Em
 You picked 12 outsiders nobody would've chosen
.    C        G                         Em                   C       G
 And You changed the world well, the moral of the story is everybody's got a purpose
.     Em
 So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
.  C        G
 &quot;Who do you think you are&quot;
 I say...

[C2]
.           Em    C        G
   I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
.        Em       C   G
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
.            Em        C      G
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
.              C      G         D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
.              C      G         D Em
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[C3]
.          G        C
   So let me go down down down in history
.         G                  D
   As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
.          Em                   A                           X 2
   And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
.              C      G        D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[C4]
.          Em        C          G
   I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
.          Em          C    G
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
.            Em                C        G
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
.              C     G         D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
.              C     G         D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
.              C     G         D G
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus</lyrics>
