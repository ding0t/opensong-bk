<title>In His time</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 In His time, In His Time
 He makes all things beautiful in His time.
 Lord please show me every day
 As You're teaching me Your way
 That You do just what You say
 In Your time.

[V2]
 In Your time, In Your Time
 You make all things beautiful in Your time.
 Lord my life to You I bring
 May each song I have to sing
 Be to you a lovely thing
 In Your time.

[V3]
 There's a time, in your time
 Both for sowing and for reaping
 There's a time
 Time for losing, time for gain
 Time for joy and time for pain
 Every purpose under heaven has a time</lyrics>
