 // I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
 the horse and rider thrown into the sea. //

[C1]
   // The Lord my God, my strength my song, has now become my victory //
   // The Lord is God and I will praise him,
   my father is God and I will exalt him. //

[V2]
 // I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
 The chariots and host thrown into the sea //

[C2]
   // The Lord my God; oh man of war, has now become my victory //
   // The Lord is God and I will praise him, my father is God and I will exalt him //

[V3]
 // I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
 They went down like a stone into the deep //

[C3]
   The Lord my God, his glory and power, has now become my victory
   Oh Lord my God, thy right hand's power, has now shattered the enemy;
   // The Lord is God and I will praise him, my father is God and I will exalt him //

[V4]
 // I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
 He plants them on his mountain that is green //

[C4]
   // Oh Lord my God, the place the spot, which thou made for thy sanctuary //
   // The Lord will reign and I will praise him, my father will reign and I will exalt him //</lyrics>
