<title>Enter into His Gates</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving
 Enter into his courts with praise
 Rejoice and be glad in our Creator
 Rejoice and be glad in The Father of Lights
 Rejoice and be glad in our Salvation
 Rejoice and be glad in The Ancient of days</lyrics>
</song>
