<lyrics>[V1]
 O Trinity of bless√®d light, O Unity of princely might, The fiery sun now goes his way; Shed Thou within our hearts a ray.

[V2]
 To Thee our morning song of praise, To Thee our evening prayer we raise; O grant us with Thy saints on high To praise Thee through eternity.

[V3]
 All laud to God the Father be, All praise, eternal Son, to Thee, All glory, as is ever meet, To God the holy Paraclete.</lyrics>
