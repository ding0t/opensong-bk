<lyrics>[C1]
   Welcome into this place
   Welcome into this broken vessel
   You desire to abide
   In the praises of Your people
   So we lift our hands
   And we lift our hearts
   As we offer up this praise
   Unto Your name

[V1]
 Creation declares Your glory
 And the universe proclaims Your majesty
 Yet you choose to abide
 In the praises of Your people
 So we offer up this praise
 Unto Your name</lyrics>
