 We have come once again
 To the time of the year
 When we celebrate, yeah
 So let our hearts fill with holiday
 Let's clap and rejoice
 For the birth of the Lamb is why we dance

 So with gladness we proclaim
 The victory is won, yeah
 Salvation, glory, and honor
 God has given us His Son
 And His name is called

   And of His kingdom there is no end, end
   Mighty God
   Everlasting Father
