<lyrics>[V1]
.          A       D/F#    G                   A        D
 I once was lost in darkest night yet thought I knew the way
.            Em               G               A  Asus D
 The sin that promised joy and life had led me to the grave
.        A                   Bm          G       Asus
 I had no hope that you would own a rebel to your will
.          A                Bm              G        A
 And if you had not loved me first I would refuse you still

[V2]
.        A      D/F#       G                A      D
 But as I ran my hell-bound race indifferent to the cost
.           Em              G                A  Asus D
 You looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross
.       A                  Bm                  G     Asus
 And I beheld Gods love displayed you suffered in my place
.            A                  Bm           G       A
 You bore the wrath reserved for me now all I know is grace

[C1]
.      G D         A       Bm          G D         A     Bm
   Hallelujah all I have is Christ Hallelujah Jesus is my life
.      G D         A       Bm          G D         A     D
   Hallelujah all I have is Christ Hallelujah Jesus is my life

[V3]
.          A        D/F#   G                A         D
 Now Lord I would be yours alone and live so all might see
.               Em             G                 A    Asus D
 The strength to follow your commands could never come from me
.        A               Bm          G       Asus
 O father use my ransomed life in any way you choose
.          A            Bm         G        A
 And let my song forever be my only boast is you</lyrics>
