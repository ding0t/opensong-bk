   Roni, Roni Bat Zion
   Heriu Yisrael
   Simchi V'altsi B'chol Lev
   Bat Yerushalayim

[C2]
   Rejoice, rejoice daughter of Zion
   Shout aloud Israel
   Sing rejoice with all your heart
   O Jerusalem

[V1]
 For the Lord has taken your
 punishment
 Destroyed your enemies
 King of Israel
 Lord of all is He
 In the midst of us
 He is mighty

[V2]
 For the Lord your God in the
 midst of you
 Mighty is His name
 Rejoicing over you
 With songs of gladness
 Sing joyfully
 He will save us

[V3]
