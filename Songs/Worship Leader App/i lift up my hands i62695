<lyrics>[V1]
 I LIFT UP MY HANDS LORD
 EVEN THOUGH I AM WEARY
 I WILL LIFT UP MY HANDS LORD
 IN THE MIDST OF MY TROUBLE

[P1]
   WHEN I LIFT UP MY HANDS
   OH I CAN FEEL
   SWEET ANOINTING AND I SING
   WHEN I LIFT UP MY HANDS LORD
   OH I CAN FEEL
   YOUR PRESENCE!!!

[C1]
   WHEN I LIFT UP MY HANDS
   MY BURDENS ARE GONE,
   THERE'S NEW STRENGTH THROUGH YOU OH GOD.
   AND IT ALL HAPPENS,
   YES, IT BEGINS
   WHEN I LIFT UP MY HANDS LORD</lyrics>
