.            D G      C     G       D C
 I'm kind of homesick for a country
.              Bm  C          G   D
 to which I've ne__ver been before
.       G       C             G
 No sad goodbyeswill there be spoken
.                 Bm/A  C     D   G D C G
 Cause time won't matt__er anymore
 Chorus:
.       G  C             G
 Beulah Land I'm longing for you
.        G C              G    D
 and someday on thee I'll stand
.                G           C G
 And there my home shall be etoEm
.G                 D       G F#m E
 Beulah Land, sweet Beulah

[V2]
 I'm looking now just across the river
 And I can see the other side
 Theres just a few more days to labor
 Then I will take my heavenly flight</lyrics>
