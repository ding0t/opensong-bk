 // I've got my mind made up
 and I won't turn back
 Because I want to see my Jesus someday //

[C1]
   Goodbye world, I stay no longer with you
   Goodbye pleasures of sin, I stay no longer with you
   God's way the rest of my life

[V2]
 // Born, born, born again Thank
 God, I'm born again //

[C2]
   // Born of the water, spirit and the blood
   Thank God, I'm born again //</lyrics>
