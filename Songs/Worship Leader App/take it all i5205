<lyrics>[V1]
. B
 Searching the world
.               A#  D#m
 The lost will be found
 In freedom we live
 As one we cry out
 You carried the cross
 You died and rose again
 My God, I'll only ever give my all

[V2]
 You sent Your Son
 From Heaven to earth
 You delivered us all
 It's eternally heard
 I searched for truth
 And all I found was You
 My God, I'll only ever give my all

[C1]
.     B          F#
   Jesus, we're living for Your Name
.         G#m          E
   We'll never be ashamed of You
.   B         F#
   Our praise and all we are today
.   C#m
   Take, take, take it all
.   C#m
   Take, take, take it all

[V3]
 You sent Your Son
 From heaven to earth
 You delivered us all
 It's eternally heard
 I searched for truth
 And all I found was You
 My God, I'll only ever give my all

[B1]
.   C#m     G#m
   Running to the One
.   F#   E
   Who heals the blind
.   C#m       G#m    F#
   Following the shining light
.   C#m
   In Your hands
.   G#m   F#     E
   The power to save the world
.      B
   And My life (2x)</lyrics>
