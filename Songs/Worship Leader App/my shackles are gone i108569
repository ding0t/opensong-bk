.C
 My shackles are gone, My spirit is free,
.              G                  C
 Oh, praise the Lord, He lifted in Me
.                                  F
 My sins are forgiven, and now I am free
.              C
 Oh, praise the Lord,
.               G                  C    G
 my shackles are gone, my spirit is free</lyrics>
