 Put on the garments of praise,
 for the spirit of heaviness
 Let the oil of gladness flow down
 from Your Throne

[V2]
 Put on the garments of praise,
 for the spirit of heaviness
 Your joy is my strength alone,
 my strength alone

[C1]
   Make these broken weary bones
   rise to dance again
   Wet this dry and thirsty land
   with a river
   Lord our eyes are fixed on You
   and we are waiting
   For your garland of grace
   as we praise Your Name

[B1]
   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
   We give all honor and praise to Your Name
   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
   We trade our sorrows for garments of praise</lyrics>
