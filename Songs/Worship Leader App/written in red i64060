<lyrics>[V1]
 In letters of crimson,
 God wrote His love
 On a hillside so long, long ago
 For you and me our Jesus died
 And love's greatest story was told

[C1]
   Kor:
.    F    C/E    Eb   Bb
   I love you, I love you
.  F/A         Dm      Gm  C
   That's what Calvary said
.    F    C/E    Cm  F7 Bb
   I love you, I lo__ve you
.  Bbm F/A      Gm      C  Fsus F
   I   love you written in red__

[V2]
 Down through the ages,
 God wrote his love
 With the same hands
 That suffered and bled
 He kept giving all that He had to give
 A message so easily read

[C2]
   Kor:
   I love you, I love you
   That's what Calvary said
   I love you...
   Oh precious is the flow
   That makes me white as snow
   No other fount I know
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus

[C3]
   Kor:
   I love you, I love you
   That's what Calvary said
   I love you, I love you
   I love you written in red</lyrics>
