   Chorus:
   Joshua fought the battle of
   Jericho, Jericho, Jericho
   Joshua fought the battle of Jericho
   And the walls came a-tumbling down

[V1]
 You may talk about the men of Gideon
 You may talk about the men of Saul
 But there's none like good old Joshua
 At the battle of Jericho

[V2]
 Up to the walls of Jericho
 They marched with spears in hand
 &quot;Come blow them ram horns,&quot; Joshua said
 &quot;Cause the battle is in our hands.&quot;

[V3]
 Then the lamb ram sheep horns
 began to blow
 The trumpets began to sound
 Joshua commanded the children to shout
 And the walls came a-tumblin' down</lyrics>
