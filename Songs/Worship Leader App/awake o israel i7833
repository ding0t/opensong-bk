<lyrics>[V1]
 Awake O Israel put off Thy slumber
 And the truth shall set you free
 For out of Zion comes thy Deliv'rer
 In the year of Jubilee

[V2]
 For in the furnace of much affliction
 I have chosen Thee behold
 And so for Iron I'll give Thee silver
 And for brass I'll give Thee gold

[V3]
 Thou art my chosen for I have sought Thee
 Thou art graven on my hand
 And I will gather all those that gather
 They shall come back to their land

[V4]
 O Hallelujah (2x)
 Hallelujah, Praise the Lord
 O Hallelujah (2x)
 Hallelujah, Praise the Lord</lyrics>
