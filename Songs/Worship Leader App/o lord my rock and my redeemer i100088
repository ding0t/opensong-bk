 My sword to fight the cruel deceiver

 And my shield against his hateful darts

 My song when enemies surround me

 My joy when trials are abounding

 Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night

 My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders

 You broke my bonds of sin and shame

 May all my days bring glory to Your Name
.           F2         G             C
 May all my days bring glory to Your Name</lyrics>
