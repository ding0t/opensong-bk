.G                C
 Still my soul be still
.           Em
 And do not fear
.                G      C             D
 Though winds of change may rage tomorrow
.G              C
 God is at your side
.          Em
 No longer dread
.             G C           D
 The fires of unexpected sorrow

[C1]
.  Em      D      G
   God You are my God
.             Am7              Em     C  D
   And I will trust in You and not be shaken
.  Em      D       G
   Lord of peace renew
.              Am7           Em
   A steadfast spirit within me
.     C       D    Em
   To rest in You alone

[V2]
.G                C
 Still my soul be still
.          Em
 Do not be moved
.          G      C               D
 By lesser lights and fleeting shadows
.G             C
 Hold onto His ways
.               Em
 With shield of faith
.            G  C              D
 Against temptations flaming arrows

[V3]
.G                C
 Still my soul be still
.          Em
 Do not forsake
.              G   C               D
 The Truth you learned in the beginning
.G             C
 Wait upon the Lord
.              Em
 And hope will rise
.         G C                   D
 As stars appear when day is dimming</lyrics>
