<lyrics>[V1]
.Em                  Am               D     G
  I cannot come before a righteous holy Lord
.Em                                  Am       D
 And offer to Him worldly things I do not need
.C                               D        Em   Am
 And hope He's pleased, for He wants me to give
.   D               G D  Em                 Am
 A heart truly His,  an offering of highest price,
.G            D            C   G
 A servant who the Lord can use

[V2]
 CHORUS:
.                C                  D              C G
 And I will not offer anything that cost me nothing
.                C                  D                C G
 I'll place before Him nothing less than my very best
.B7       Em                     D
 And if I'm called into sacrifice
.             C                 G
 It will be worthy of my Christ,
.               Am           D                  Em (INTRO)
 I will not offer anything that cost me nothing.

[V3]
 VERSE 2:
.Em                           Am       D     G
 To serve Him is my goal how could I withhold
.Em                      Am
  Whatever's mine He's given me
.D                              C D
 It's not my own. It's His alone
.Em                  Am        D        G D
 Whatever He requires, that is my desire
.Em                        Am
  Whatever He may need from me
.G    D                         C G
 I'll pay the cost gain or loss.</lyrics>
