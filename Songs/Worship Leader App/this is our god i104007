<lyrics>[V1]
 Your grace is enough
 More than I need
 At Your word I will believe
 I wait for You
 Draw near again
 Let Your Spirit make me new

[C1]
   And I will fall at Your feet
   I will fall at Your feet
   And I will worship You here

[V2]
 Your presence in me
 Jesus light the way
 By the power of Your word
 I am restored
 I am redeemed
 By Your Spirit I am free

[B1]
   Freely You gave it all for us
   Surrendered Your life upon that cross
   Great is the love
   Poured out for all
   This is our God

[B2]
   Lifted on high from death to life
   Forever our God is glorified
   Servant and King
   Rescued the world</lyrics>
