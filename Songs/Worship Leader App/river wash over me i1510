<lyrics>[V1]
 River, Wash Over Me
 Cleanse Me And Make Me New
 Bathe Me, Refresh Me And Fill Me Anew
 River Wash Over Me

[V2]
 Spirit, Watch Over Me
 Lead Me To Jesus' Feet
 Cause Me To Worship And Fill Me Anew
 Spirit, Watch Over Me

[V3]
 Jesus, Rule Over Me
 Reign Over All My Heart
 Teach Me To Praise You And Fill Me Anew
 Jesus, Rule Over Me
 Teach Me To Praise You And Fill Me Anew
 Jesus, Rule Over Me</lyrics>
