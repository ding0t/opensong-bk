 We gather as God's dwelling place
 A house of living stone
 We've given praise Lord
 You've made Your presence known

[V2]
 Now we worship and sing
 Hallelujah
 Christ has risen from the dead
 But if our praises cease
 If we hold our peace
 The rocks will cry out instead

[V3]
 I ain't gonna let
 No rock outpraise me
 I ain't gonna let
 No rock cry in my place
 I ain't gonna let
 No rock outpraise me
 I ain't gonna let it sing
 Ain't gonna let it sing
 In my place

[V4]
 I will make a joyful noise
 I will sing a joyful song
 That is pleasing to
 The ear of the Lord

[V5]
 I will make a joyful noise
 I will sing a joyful song
 That is pleaseing to the ear of the Lord</lyrics>
