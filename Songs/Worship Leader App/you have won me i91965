<title>You have won me</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Grace, You've shown me grace
 You've lifted my shame
 Drawn me with loving kindness
 Washed whiter than snow
 You have redeemed and made me whole

[C1]
   Jesus, You have won me
   You have broken every Chain with love and mercy
   You have triumphed over Death and You are worthy
   Of glory and praise

[V2]
 Love, You've shown me love
 By leaving Your throne
 By bleeding and dying on a cross
 That wonderful cross
 That took all my guilt and sin away

[B1]
   Shout it out and lift up one voice in worship
   Sing it out until all the earth can hear it
   Jesus is alive and He saves, He rescues and saves</lyrics>
