<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse 1]
.C
 Wandering into the night
.C
 Wanting a place to hide
.           F                C
 This weary soul, this bag of bones
.C
 And I tried with all my might
.C
 But I just can't win the fight
.           F           C
 I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond
.    G               Am
 And just when I ran out of road
.  F           C
 I met a man I didn't know
.    G               Am         F
 And He told me that I was not alone

[V2]
 [Chorus]
.   C
 He picked me up
.   Dm
 He turned me around
.   C/E               F
 He placed my feet on solid ground
.            Am
 I thank the Master
.            F
 I thank the Savior
.           C
 Because He healed my heart
.   Dm
 He changed my name
.   C/E            F
 Forever free, I'm not the same
.            Am
 I thank the Master
.            F
 I thank the Savior
.        C
 I thank God

 [Verse 2]
.C
 I cannot dеny what I see
.C
 Got no choice but to believе
.              F
 My doubts are burning
.                  C
 Like ashes in the wind
.C
 So, so long to my old friends
.C
 Burden and bitterness
.                     F
 You can just keep it moving
.                       C
 Nah, you ain't welcome here
.     G                   Am
 From now 'til I walk the streets of gold
.     F               C
 I'll sing of how you saved my soul
.    G               Am
 This wayward son has found his way back
.F
 home

[V5]
 [Chorus]
.   C
 He picked me up
.   Dm
 He turned me around
.   C/E               F
 He placed my feet on solid ground
.            Am
 I thank the Master
.            F
 I thank the Savior
.           C
 Because He healed my heart
.   Dm
 He changed my name
.   C/E            F
 Forever free, I'm not the same
.            Am
 I thank the Master
.            F
 I thank the Savior
.            C
 Oh, I thank God
