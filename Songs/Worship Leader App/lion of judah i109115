 Tell me who has defeated the darkness?
 Who has defeated the grave?
 Who is the Lion of Judah?
 The strength and the
 shield of our faith?

[V2]
 Tell me who has defeated our fears?
 Who washed away all our shame?
 Who is the Lion of Judah?
 The strength and the
 shield of our faith?

[C1]
   Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
   Hallelujah Jesus is the Lord (Ã—4)

[V3]
 Who gave His life just to save ours?
 Who gave His life up for us?
 Who chose to die for all mankind?
 To Him be the glory alone!

[V4]
 Who shall be one day returning?
 Leading His armies to war?
 He is the hero of ages,
 To Him be the glory alone!</lyrics>
