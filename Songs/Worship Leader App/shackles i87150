 In the corners of my mind

 Cause you see I have been down for so long

 Feel like the hope is gone

 But as I lift my hands, I understand

 That I should praise you through my circumstance

[V2]
.     Am
 Everything that could go wrong

 All went wrong at one time
.         E
 So much pressure fell on me
.            Am
 I thought I was gonna lose my mind

 But I know you wanna see

 If I will hold on through these trials
.       E
 But I need you to lift this load
.        Am
 Cause I can't take it anymore
