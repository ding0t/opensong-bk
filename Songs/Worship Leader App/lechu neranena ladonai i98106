<lyrics>[V1]
 //// Let us sing unto the LORD for joy,
 To the Rock of our salvation ////

[C1]
   Come into His presence with praise,
   Singing and shouting proclaim
   That ADONAI is our Great God,
   Come into His presence with praise,
   Singing and shouting proclaim
   That ADONAI is our King

[V2]
 //// Lechu Neranena L'Adonai
 Nariya L'tzur Yishenu ////

[C2]
   // Nekpadma panav betoda
   Bizmirot Nariya Lo,
   Ki El Gadol Adonai //

[V3]
 // Depths of the earth are in His Hands,
 and the mountain piece are His //
 // His is the sea for He made it,
 By His hands He formed dry land //

[V4]
 Let us worship and bow down,
 Kneel before the LORD our Maker,
 /// Worship and bow down,
 Kneel before the LORD our Maker ///</lyrics>
