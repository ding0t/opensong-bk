 Just suppose God
 searched through Heaven
 He couldn't find one
 willing to be
 The Supreme Sacrifice
 that was needed
 That could buy
 Eternal Life for you and me

[C1]
   Had it not been for a place
   called mount Calvary
   Had it not been for
   the old rugged cross
   Had it not been for
   a man called Jesus
   Then forever my
   soul would be lost

[V2]
 And I am glad He was
 willing to drink that bitter cup
 Even though He prayed
 &quot;Father let it pass from me&quot;
 And I'm so glad He never
 called Heavens Angels
 &quot;From my hands
 - pull the nails that torment me&quot;</lyrics>
