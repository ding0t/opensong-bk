<lyrics>[V1]
.A                              D        A
 I am tired and so weary but I must toil on
.         A             B7             E7
 Till the Lord comes to call, call me away, o yes
.          A                           D            A
 Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
.        A                   B7   E7     A
 And the night, night is as fair as the day

[C1]
.                D                       A
   There will be peace in the valley for me some day
.                             B7         E7
   There will be peace in the valley for me I pray
.          A          A7         D                     B7
   No more sorrow and sadness or trouble, trouble I'll see
.                A            B7     E7  A
   There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

[V2]
.                                      D               A
 Where the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
.        A              B7          E7
 And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
.        A                             D         A
 And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a child
.            A                 B7        E7    A
 And I'll be changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

[C2]
.                D                       A
   There will be peace in the valley for me some day
.                             B7         E7
   There will be peace in the valley for me I pray
.          A          A7         D                     B7
   No more sorrow and sadness or trouble, trouble I'll see
.                A            B7     E7  A
   There will be peace in the valley for me

[C3]
.          A          A7         D                     B7
   No more sorrow and sadness or trouble, trouble I'll see
.                A            B7     E7  A
   There will be peace in the valley for me</lyrics>
