<lyrics>[V1]
 Come and go with me
 To my Father's House,
 To my Father's House,
 To my Father's House.
 Come and go with me,
 To my Father's House,
 Where There's peace, peace, peace.

[V2]
 Jesus will be there
 In my Father's House
 In my Father's House,
 In my Father's House.
 Jesus will be there
 In my Father's House,
 Where there's peace, peace, peace.

[V3]
 There'll be no sorrow there
 In my Father's House,
 In my Father's House,
 In my Father's House.
 There'll be no sorrow there
 In my Father's House.
 There'll be joy, real joy.</lyrics>
