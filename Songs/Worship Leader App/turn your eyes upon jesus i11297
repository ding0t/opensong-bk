<lyrics>[V1]
 O soul, are you weary and troubled?
 No light in the darkness you see?
 There's light for a look at the Saviour,
 And life more abundant and free!

[C1]
.  E         B         C#m E7
   Turn your eyes upon Je__sus,
.       A           F#m       B
   Look full in His wonderful face;
.          E         E7
   And the things of earth
.            A         Am/F#
   Will grow strangely dim
.         E            B7        E
   In the light of His glory and grace.

[V2]
 Through death into life everlasting
 He passed, and we follow Him there;
 Over us sin no more hath dominion,
 For more than conqu'rors we are!

[V3]
 His Word shall not fail you,
 He promised;
 Believe Him, and all will be well;
 Then go to a world that is dying,
 His perfect salvation to tell!</lyrics>
