<lyrics>[V1]
 My sheep know My voice,
 And the path that I take,
 They follow wherever I go;
 My sheep know My voice
 And come at My call,
 But a stranger's voice
 do they not know.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   My sheep know My voice,
   And day by day,
   They abide in the fold,
   And go not astray;
   They love Me because
   I have made them My choice,
   And they follow My call,
   For My sheep know My voice.

[V2]
 My sheep know My voice,
 And the pastures of green,
 Where I lead them so often to feed;
 My sheep know My voice,
 And the cool sparkling stream,
 Where beside its still waters I lead.

[V3]
 My sheep know My voice,
 And the valley of death,
 Thru which I shall
 lead them some day;
 But no danger nor harm
 Can touch one of them,
 For I will be with them always.</lyrics>
