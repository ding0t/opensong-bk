   I see the Lord
.             G
   I see the Lord
.    A     Bm            F#m
   Exalted high upon the worship
.          G             A
   Of the people of the earth

   I see the Lord

[V1]
.      D          A/C#
 The train of His robe
.          Bm    F#m
 Fills the temple
.    G                D
 A cloud of heavenly worshipers
.   Bm             A
 Surrounding His throne
.    G              A
 We join with them now crying
. F#4 F# Bm         G
 &quot;Holy holy is the Lamb
.    D/F#   A
 The Lamb alone&quot;</lyrics>
