<lyrics>[V1]
 There's a land that is fairer than day,
 And by faith we can see it afar;
 For the Father waits over the way,
 To prepare us a dwelling place there.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   In the sweet by and by,
   We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
   In the sweet by and by,
   We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

[V2]
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore
 The melodious songs of the blest,
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

[V3]
 To our bountiful Father above
 We will offer our tribute of praise,
 For the glorious gift of His love
 And the blessings that hallow our days.</lyrics>
