<title>You are my one thing</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I don't want anything but You
 You're more than every dream come true
 All of the things I thought I wanted
 Don't come close to knowing You

[V2]
 Now that I'm Yours and You are mine
 Our love is the secret that I find
 I'll spend forever in the pleasure
 I've found looking in Your eyes

[C1]
   Give me Jesus
   Give me Jesus
   You can have all this world
   You can have all this world

[V3]
 More than silver more than gold
 You are the treasure that I hold
 Now that I've tasted of Your goodness
 Nothing else will satisfy

[B1]
   I don't want anyone else
   I don't need anything else
   You are my one thing
   You are my one thing</lyrics>
