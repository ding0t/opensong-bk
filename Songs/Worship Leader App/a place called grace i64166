 So many years I heard it told
 The story of compassion
 A prodigal son who left the fold
 And found no satisfaction
 On my knees, Lord, I cried out to You
 I'm so alone
 But if there's room in Your
 house for one more
 I'm ready to come back home?

[V2]
 Chorus
 I know there is a place
 Where arms of compassion
 welcome me home
 Sweet mercy falls like rain
 I know there's a place called grace

[V3]
 So many days I've dreamed of grace
 Yet I have to wonder
 How many times my human strength
 Has kept me from surrender
 The more I learn just to lean on the cross
 The more I see
 When I fall, I will fall to the place
 Where mercy reaches me

[V4]
 Chorus2
 If it seems that my courage is strong
 There's just one reason
 He's the Rock that my faith is built on
 He holds me in His arms
 Gives me strength to carry on

[V5]
