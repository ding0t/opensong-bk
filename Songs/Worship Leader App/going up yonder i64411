<lyrics>[V1]
 Do you wanna know?
 Where I'm going?
 Where I'm going, soon.

[V2]
 If anybody asks you,
 Where I'm going,
 Where I'm going, soon.

[V3]
 CHORUS
 I'm goin' up yonder
 I'm goin' up yonder
 I'm goin' up yonder
 To be with my Lord.

[V4]
 I can take the pain,
 The heartaches they bring,
 The comfort in knowing,
 I'll soon be gone.

[V5]
 As God gives me grace,
 I'll run this race,
 Until I see my Savior,
 face to face.</lyrics>
