 Lyrics and Chords:
.C   Gadd9               D/F#          Em     Em7/D
 The trials of this world were getting closer,
.    Am7         Cadd9/D               G    Am7add11
 The pull I felt was more than I could bear,
.    G            D/F#     Em7
 And I was on the verge of giving over:
.    A7sus4          A7                    Cadd9/D
 The strength within myself just wasn't there.

[C1]
   Chorus:
.                  G         D/F#
   Something keeps holding me,
.       Em7      G/D
   Everyday I see,
.                  C         CM7/B

   To overcome my trials;
.                   G         D/F#
   He's guiding me constantly,

[V2]
 Satan lay before me his temptation
 Of his desire to steal away my faith,
 But I have found in time the revelation,
 The strength I need to keep me by His grace.

[C2]
   Chorus 2:
   Jesus is holding me,
   Everyday I see,
   He's helping me faithfully
   To overcome my trials;
   He's guiding me constantly,
   Giving me victory,
   He's a reality;
   Jesus is holding me.</lyrics>
