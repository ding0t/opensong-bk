 Behold what manner of man is this
 Who stills the raging sea

[V2]
 He heals the sick, the lame, the halt
 And makes the blind to see
 He opens all the prison doors
 And sets the captives free
 Behold what manner of man is this
 What manner of man is He?

[C1]
   He's the Lord of Glory
   He is the great I Am
   The Alpha and Omega
   The beginning and the end
   His name is Wonderful
   The Prince of Peace is He
   He's the everlasting Father
   Throughout eternity.

[V3]
 Behold what manner of man is this
 Who stands between God and man
 His eyes are as a flame of fire
 Seven stars are in His hand
 John saw him in the seven churches
 As the sun in brilliancy
 Behold what manner of man is this,
 What manner of man is He?

[V4]
 Behold what manner of man is this
 Who healed the lame and halt
 Who says &quot;Thy sins be forgiven thee
 Take up thy bed and walk&quot;
 He stands as the mighty healer now
 And cries &quot;Come unto me&quot;
 Behold what manner of man is this

[V5]
 What manner of man is He?

[V6]
 Behold what manner of man is this
 Who sits on His heavenly throne
 He rules and reigns from heaven above
 His beloved and His own
 He's the lion of the tribe of Judah
 The root of David is He
 Behold what manner of man is this
 What manner of man is He?</lyrics>
