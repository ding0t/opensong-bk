<lyrics>[V1]
.       D/F#               G
 In the darkness we were waiting
.         A              D
 Without hope, without light
.          D/F#              G
 Till from heaven You came running
.           A            D
 There was mercy in Your eyes
.    D/F#               G
 To fulfil the law and prophets
.      A               D
 To a virgin came the Word
.         D/F#              G
 From a throne of endless glory
.       A             D
 To a cradle in the dirt

[C1]
.  D                  G2
   Praise the Father, praise the Son
.  Bm7               D/A      A
   Praise the Spirit three in one
.  D             G2
   God of glory, Majesty
.  Bm7       G2          A       D
   Praise forever to the King of Kings

[V2]
.     D/F#             G
 To reveal the kingdom coming
.       A              D
 And to reconcile the lost
.      D/F#             G
 To redeem the whole creation
.        A               D
 You did not despise the Cross
.    D/F#          G
 For e-ven in your suffering
.        A            D
 You saw to the other side
.        D/F#            G
 Knowing this was our salvation
.      A                D
 Jesus for our sake You died

[V3]
.        Bm               G
 And the morning that You rose
.        A               D
 All of heaven held its breath
.          Bm                  G
 Till that stone was moved for good
.        A                  D
 For the Lamb had conquered death
.        Bm               G
 And the dead rose from their tombs
.         A              D
 And the angels stood in awe
.        Bm               G
 For the souls of all who'd come
.       A             D
 To the Father are restored

[V4]
.        D/F#                 G
 And the church of Christ was born
.         A              D
 Then the Spirit lit the flame
.         D/F#            G
 Now this gospel truth of old
.          A                D
 Shall not kneel, shall not faint
.       D/F#             G
 By His blood and in His name
.       A            D
 In His freedom I am free
.        D/F#          G
 For the love of Jesus Christ
.        A           D
