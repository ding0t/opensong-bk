<lyrics>[V1]
.     G
 The nails in your hands
.     Em
 The nails in your feet
.      C
 They tell me how much
.      D
 You love me
.      G
 The thorns on your brow
.Em
 They tell me how
.     C
 You bore so much pain
.     D
 To love me
.              Bm            C
 And when the heavens pass away
.          Bm                  C
 All your scars will still remain
.       Bm              C
 And forever they will say
.                   D
 Just how much you love me, so I want to say

[C1]
.      G               Em                C                D
   Forever my love, forever my heart, forever my life is yours
.      G               Em                C                D
   Forever my love, forever my heart, forever my life is yours
.               G
