   Yeshua (x4)

[V1]
 There is only one Name under Heaven,
 Given to man by which we must be saved.
 He is above every dominion,
 Jesus Christ, Yeshua is His name.

[V2]
 He is coming on the clouds of Heaven,
 To bring us to the new Jerusalem.
 Until then we patiently await Him,
 Our Lord, our Savior and our Friend.</lyrics>
