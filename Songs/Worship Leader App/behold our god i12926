<lyrics>[V1]
.C                Em
 Who has held the oceans in His hands?
.C                Em
 Who has numbered every grain of sand?
.F                 G
 Kings and nations tremble at His voice
.Am           Em         G
 All creation rises to rejoice

[C1]
.    C    G   Am                 F
   Behold our God, seated on His throne
.                C    G
   Come, let us adore Him
.    C    G   Am                   F
   Behold our King, nothing can compare
.                C  G
   Come, let us adore Him!

[V2]
.C             Em
 Who has given counsel to the Lord?
.C                Em
 Who can question any of His words?
.F                 G
 Who can teach the One who knows all things?
.Am             Em
 Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?

[V3]
.C                Em
 Who has felt the nails upon His hands
.C               Em
 Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?
.F            G
 God eternal, humbled to the grave
.Am             Em           G
 Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign!

[B1]
.       C                 F
   //// You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth) ////
.     Am                  F
   // You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth) //
.  C                 F
   You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth)
.  Am                F
   You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth)</lyrics>
