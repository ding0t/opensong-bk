.C            F       C
 We've come to join the song
.C        F         C
 Sung long before our lives
.            Am    F    C
 To raise our voice along
.          Am    F    C
 Heaven and Earth alike
.C              F      C
 We've seen Your faithful hand
.C         F      C
 Your mercy without end
.         Am    F  C
 A king who bled and died
.         Am    F  C
 A God who sacrificed

[C1]
.    Am                              F
   Be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
.          C             G
   You are worthy Lord of all
.      Am                             Dm
   Unto You the slain and risen King we lift our voice with Heaven
.          C            G
   Singing worthy Lord of all

[V2]
.C              Csus    C
 All through this life we lead
.C      Csus     C
 And on to eternity
.           Am     F   C
 Our endless praise will cry
.        Am    F C
 Jesus be glorified
.        Am    F C
 Jesus be glorified

[B1]
.  Am      F      C
    Highest praises Lord of all
.  Am      F      C
    Highest praises Lord of all
.  Am      F             C              G
    Highest praises You are worthy Lord of all</lyrics>
