<lyrics>[V1]
 In the presence of my enemies
 When the storm is crashing down on me
 I will trust in what I cannot see
 I wait for You, I wait for You

[P1]
   You can part the violent sea
   You can reach the depths of me!

[C1]
   I know, nothing is impossible
   I know, every chain is breakable
   I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand

[V2]
 I am waiting at the water's edge
 Holding steadfast onto Your promises
 Even though I'm not there yet
 I trust in You, I trust in You

[P2]
   You can part the violent sea
   You can reach the depths of me!

[C2]
   I know, nothing is impossible
   I know, every chain is breakable
   I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!
   My fear, is conquered by His perfect love
   My life, is ransomed by His royal blood
   I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand

[B1]
   My hope is built on nothing less
   Than Jesus blood and righteousness
   When darkness seems to hide His face
   I rest in His unchanging grace
   In every high and stormy gale
   My anchor holds within the veil
   On Christ the solid rock I stand
   All other ground is sinking sand!

[C3]
   I know, nothing is impossible
   I know, every chain is breakable
   I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!
   My fear, is conquered by His perfect love
   My life, is ransomed by His royal blood
   I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!</lyrics>
