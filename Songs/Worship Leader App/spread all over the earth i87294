<lyrics>[V1]
 // Holy Spirit, Breath of God
 Come blow, come blow on us
 Holy Spirit, Wind of God
 Come blow and empower us //

[C1]
   Send Your fire, tongues of fire
   Come rest on us
   Send Your fire, send revival
   Send your fire on us

[V2]
 // Heavenly Father, may Your grace
 be known all over the earth
 Heavenly Father, may the Good News
 spread all over the earth //

[C2]
   May the Good News of Your Kingdom
   spread all over the earth
   The sound of praise and songs of worship
   be all over the earth

[V3]
 Holy Spirit, Breath of God
 Come blow, come blow on us
 Holy Spirit, Wind of God
 Come blow and empower us

[V4]
 Heavenly Father, may Your grace
 be known all over the earth
 Heavenly Father, may the Good News
 spread all over the earth
 //// May the Good News Spread all over the earth ////</lyrics>
