<lyrics>[V1]
 You have opened the door
 to the riches of God
 and poured out Your life for the lost
 The Lamb Who was slain
 You erased all our sin
 Purchased men with Your blood
 and made us as priests unto God
 The Lamb Who was slain

[C1]
   You are worthy
   You are faithful
   You are holy
   The Lamb Who was slain

[V2]
 You came down as a Man
 and You suffered the cross
 The King of the heavens became
 The Lamb Who was slain
 But our God raised You up
 and our tongues now confess
 That You are the Lord and the Christ
 The Lamb Who was slain</lyrics>
