<lyrics>[V1]
.E              C#m7        A2                       Bsus E
 What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
.E                C#m7         A2                       Bsus E
 What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[C1]
.  E           C#m7
   Oh precious is the flow,
.  Bsus
   That makes me white as snow;
.  E        C#m7
   No other fount I know,
.  A2                       Bsus E
   Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[V2]
.E             C#m7        A2                       Bsus E
 For my pardon this I see, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
.E                C#m7          A2                       Bsus E
 For my cleansing this my plea, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[V3]
.E               C#m7       A2                       Bsus E
 Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
.E                   C#m7         A2                       Bsus E
 Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[V4]
.E              C#m7            A2                       Bsus E
 This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
.E              C#m7           A2                       Bsus E
 This is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.</lyrics>
