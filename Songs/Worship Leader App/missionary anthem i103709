.        Am         C
 For the Lamb has conquered
.     G            D
 And I will follow Him
 To the ends of the earth
 And I will follow Him

[C1]
.                Am    F
   Jesus, You're worthy
.      C              G
   Of every tribe and tongue
   It's all for Your glory
   Till every soul is won

[V2]
.F                     C
 The harvest is ready, we have to go
.G                         Am
 And we won't stop till the whole world knows
.     F                     C
 The power in Your blood to save every soul
.       G                 Am
 We're not ashamed of the Gospel

[B1]
.       F
   And I will preach the Gospel
.       C
   I'll die and be forgotten
.       G                 Am
   As long as You get the glory</lyrics>
