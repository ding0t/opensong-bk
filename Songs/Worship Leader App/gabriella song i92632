<lyrics>[V1]
.      A           D        A
 It is now that my life is mine
.     A                      E
 I've got this short time on earth
.       A            D          A
 And my longing has brought me here
.       A         E     A
 All I lacked and all I gaint

[C1]
.      A            D          A
   And yet it's the way that I chose
.     A                    E
   My trust was far beyond words
.           A          D      A
   That has shown me a little bit
.         A          E      A
   Of the heaven I've never found

[V2]
.A       E      A    D
 I want to feel I'm alive
.A        E      A
 All my living days
.         D     Bm  A
 I will live as I desire
.A      E       A    D
 I want to feel I'm alive
.A             E       F#m
 Knowing I was good enough

[P1]
.  F#m - A - E - F#m
   (Instrumental)

[V3]
.       A     D          A
 I have never lost who I was
.       A            E
 I have only left it sleeping
.     A       D     A
 Maby I never had a choice
.         A        E    A
 Just the will to stay alive

[V4]
.A     E       A     D     A     E     A
 All I want is to be happy being who I am
.      D          E     A
 To be strong and to be free
.           Bm   A         E
 To see the day arise from night

[C2]
.  A E  A           D       F#m  E
   I am here and my life is only mine
.          A        E           A
   And the heaven I thought was here
.       A           E          A
   I'll discover it there somewhere

[C3]
.  A  E   A        D        A     E  A
   I want to feel that I've lived my life</lyrics>
