<title>Come Home Running</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh heart of mine why must you stray?
 From One so fair you run away
 And one more time you have to pay
 The heaviness of needless shame
 Oh heart of mine come back home
 You've been too long out on your own
 And He's been there all along
 Watching for you down the road

[C1]
   So come home running
   His arms are open wide
   His name is Jesus and He understands
   He is the answer you are looking for
   So come home running just as you are

[V2]
 Oh child of God so dearly loved
 And ransomed by the saviour's blood
 Called by name, daughter and son
 Wrapped in the robe of righteousness
 So come home running
 His arms are open wide
 His name is Jesus and He understands
 He is the answer you are looking for
 So come home running just as you are

[C2]
   So come home running
   His arms are open wide
   His name is Jesus and He understands
   He is the answer you are looking for
   So come home running just as you are
   Just as you are</lyrics>
