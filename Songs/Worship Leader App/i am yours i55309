<lyrics>[V1]
.Am                C
  I see Your fingerprints,
.                  F
 the work of Your hands it's all in Your hands
.Am            C
  I see the evidence,
.                     F
 leaving nothing to chance,
 the world's in Your hands
.G                         Am
 So I rest in Your promises,
.                     F
 Now I am sure of this I'm Yours

[C1]
.  C
   Let the waters rise,
.                              Am
   I will stand as the oceans roar
   Let the earth shake beneath me,
.                     G
   let the mountains fall
.                           F
   You are God over the storm and
.      C (C/G)
   I am Yours

[V2]
.Am                        C
  I hear the voice of love, Calling me home,
.F
  To where I belong
.Am
  It cripples every fear,
.C                         F
  And the ones who will kneel,
 Will walk away healed
.G                         Am
 So I rest in Your promises,
.                   F
 Now I am sure of this I'm Yours
.G                       Am
 No power is strong enough
.                             F
 To separate me from Your love I'm Yours

[B1]
.  C*(once)
   Even the thunder and the wind obey,
.  G*                 Am*
   at the command of my Father Father
.  F*
   I set my feet upon Your
.  C*          G*                      Am
   mighty Name, so let the rain fall harder harder
.  C
   So take my everything, my flesh and blood
.  G                       Am
   I'll lay me down on the altar, altar
.  F                    C            G*
   I am forever covered in Your love,
   So let the rain fall hard</lyrics>
