. C             G
 Every new day Your glory unfolds
.   F                   C             G
 Filling my eyes with Your treasures untold
.   F                 F                  C
 The beauty of holiness brings worship anew
.   F        G        C
 My greatest love is You

[V2]
.  F           C          G
 Call me deeper into Your grace
.   F                       C       G
 The river that flows from the Holy Place
. F                            C
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
.   F      G        C
 My greatest love is You

[V3]
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
 My greatest love is You
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
 My greatest love is You</lyrics>
