<lyrics>[V1]
 Think about His love
 Think about His goodness
 Think about His grace,
 that has brought us through
 for as high as the heaven's above,
 so great is the measure of our Fathers love
 great is the measure of our Fathers love

[V2]
 How could I forget His mercy
 How could I forget His love
 He satisfies, He satisfies,
 He satisfies my desires
 great is the mesure of our Fathers love</lyrics>
