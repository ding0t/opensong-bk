<title>Golden Love</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 It is this golden love
 That the father showered on me
 That brought me out of the mirry clay
 From a slave to a co-heir
 With love redemmed me
 God's love for me can never fail

[V2]
 I have found love
 Beyond compare
 A mega love
 Unfailing love
 When I am down
 He lift me up
 God fix me up
 And gave me hope

[V3]
 All glory and honor to the Lord
 All glory and honor to the Lord</lyrics>
