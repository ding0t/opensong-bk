.Em                      C
 The gates of hell shall not prevail
.          D             Em
 Against the army of the Lord
.Em                   C                D             Em
 As we march along we sing a song of the one who set us free
.Em                    C                      D         Em
 We use Gods word as a two-edged sword against the enemy

[V2]
.C       D      G              Em
 Emmanuel, We're marching in your name
.C       D      G          Em
 Emmanuel, The lamb that was slain
.C       D   G         Em
 Emmanuel, Is risen again
.C       D      Em
