<lyrics>[V1]
.            Dm      A   Dm
 This is the year of jubilee,
.         Gm
 When the lame shall walk,
.        A
 And the blind shall see,
.        Dm                Gm      A
 And the Lord will set the captive free,
.            Bbm     C   Dm
 This is the year of jubilee

[C1]
.     Dm      Gm
   Shalom, Shalom!
.     C       F
   Shalom, Shalom!
.     Bbm     Gm
   Shalom, Shalom!
.    Bbm        A    Dm
   Jerusalem, Jerusalem.</lyrics>
