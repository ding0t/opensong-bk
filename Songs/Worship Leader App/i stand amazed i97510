<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus the Nazarene
 And wonder how He could love me
 A sinner, condemned, unclean

[C1]
   Singing,
   How marvelous! how wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be
   How marvelous and how wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!

[V2]
 He took my sins and my sorrows
 And He made them His very own
 And bore the burden to Calvary
 And suffered and died alone

[V3]
 And when with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see
 It will be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me</lyrics>
