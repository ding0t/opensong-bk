<lyrics>[V1]
 I feel the touch of hands
 So warm and tender
 They're leading me in paths
 That I must trod
 I have no fear
 When Jesus walks beside me
 For I'm sheltered
 In the arms of God

[C1]
   Chorus
   So let the storms rage high
   The dark clouds rise
   They won't worry me
   For I'm sheltered safe
   Within the arms of God
   He walks with me
   And naught of earth can harm me
   Sheltered safe within the arms of God

[V2]
 Soon I shall hear
 The call from Heaven's portals
 &quot;Come home my child,
 It's the last mile you must trod&quot;
 I'll fall asleep
 And wake in God's new heaven
 Sheltered safe
 Within the arms of God</lyrics>
