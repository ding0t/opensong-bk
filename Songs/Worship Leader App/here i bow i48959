.              A
 Where would I run
.                     E/G#
 But to the throne of mercy
.                A
 Where would I kneel
.                     E/G#
 But at this cross of grace
.                A
 How great the love
.                         E/G#
 How strong the hand that holds us

 Beautiful, so beautiful

 There is a King

 Who came in grace and truth

 How great the love

 That carries us to kindness

   Right here, and now, be glorified

   God who brought me back to life
