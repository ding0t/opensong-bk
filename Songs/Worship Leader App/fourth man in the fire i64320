<lyrics>[V1]
 The moment now is come,
 there's nothing to be done
 My accusers stand before me
 and there's no where left to run
 And so it ends this way,
 there's nothing more to say
 I will pay the price and give my life
 for the choice that I have made
 Oh but suddenly what is this I see
 As I'm cast into the fire,
 there is One who stands by me

[C1]
   I saw the fourth man between the flames and I
   When there was no hope at all
   He saved me just in time
   Holding back the forces that pressed on every side
   I am saved by the fourth man in the fire
   I am saved by the fourth man in the fire

[V2]
 And now the test is passed,
 but it was not the last
 For my accusers seek to find me weak
 and constantly attack
 Searching to and fro, constantly they go
 And in my desperate hour, seek to devour
 and strike the fatal blow
 But I am not afraid
 and they are much dismayed
 For between us stands the Son of Man
 and the standard He has raised

[V3]
 Jesus fights for me, in my hour of need
 Standing by my side,
 He's holding back the tide
 When there was no hope at all
 He saved me just in time

[C2]

   I saw the fourth man between the flames and I
   When there was no hope at all
   He saved me just in time
   Nothing now can harm me with Jesus at my side
   I am saved by the fourth man in the fire
   I am saved by the fourth man in the fire</lyrics>
