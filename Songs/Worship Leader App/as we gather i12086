 You have called us by Your Spirit into worship
 In this temple You have set our hearts aflame
 As we lay our hearts upon Your holy altar
 We'll be blessed in Jesus' name (2X)

[V3]
 Let us cleanse our hearts as we begin to worship
 Let us fill our hearts with love for You and sing
 Open up our eyes so we may come to know You
 And unto us the Spirit bring [2X]</lyrics>
