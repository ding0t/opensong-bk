 // Blessed are You, Adonai,
 King of the Universe -
 Who has kept us
 in life
 and has preserved us
 and enabled us
 To reach this time //
 To reach this time
 To reach this day

[C1]
   A new day in my life
   A day to worship Adonai,
   A time of blessing,
   A time of joy,
   A time of love!

[V2]
 Blessed are You, El Shadai
 The awesome God
 He was and He is
 and He shall come
 and every knee shall bow
 and every tongue confess
 that He is The Lord

[B1]
