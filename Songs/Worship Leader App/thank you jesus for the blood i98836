 intro
.Bb F Gm
  

[V2]
.Bb
 I was a wretch
.  Gm7
 I remember who I was
.      Eb         Bb
 I was lost I was blind
.      F
 I was running out of time
.Bb
 Sin separated
.    Gm7
 The breach was far too wide
.             Eb              Bb
 But from the far side of the chasm
.    F
 You held me in Your sight

[V3]
.   Bb
 So You made a way
. Gm7
 Across the great divide
.     Eb              Bb
 Left behind Heaven's throne
.   F
 To build it here inside
.    Bb
 And there at the cross
.    Gm7
 You paid the debt I owed
.         Eb
 Broke my chains
.         Bb
 Freed my soul
.        F
 For the first time I had hope

[C1]
.  Bb
   Thank You Jesus
.          Eb       Bb
   For the blood applied
.  Gm    F   Bb
   Thank You Jesus
.         Gm        F
   It has washed me white
.  Gm    F    Eb
   Thank You Jesus
.                 F  Gm
   You have saved my life
.  Eb                   Bb
   Brought me from the darkness
.       F        Bb
   Into glorious light

[V4]
.Bb               F
 You took my place
.     Gm7
 Laid inside my tomb of sin
.         Eb               Bb
 You were buried for three days
.             F
 But then You walked right out again
.        Bb
 And now death has no sting
.     Gm7
 And life has no end
.    Eb               Bb
 For I have been transformed
.       F
 By the blood of the Lamb

[B1]
.  Eb
   There is nothing stronger
.           F
   Than the wonder working power
.         Gm        Dm
   Of the blood the blood
.       Eb
   That calls us sons and daughters
.         F
   We are ransomed by our Father
.              Gm        Dm
   Through the blood the blood

[V5]
.      Eb     Bb
 Glory to His name
.      Gm     F
 Glory to His name
.Bb
 There to my heart
.        Eb       Bb
 Was the blood applied
.      F      Bb
 Glory to His name</lyrics>
