<lyrics>[V1]
.         Em
 All these pieces
.          G
 Broken and scattered
.        Em
 In mercy gathered
.          G
 Mended and whole
.      Em
 Empty handed
.       G
 But not forsaken
.            D
 I've been set free
.            Em   D
 I've been set free

[P1]
.  C
   Amazing grace
.      D
   How sweet the sound
.      Em                 C
   That saved a wretch like me
.    C
   I once was lost
.      D
   But now I am found
.     Em            C
   Was blind but now I see

[C1]
   CHORUS:
.                 G    D
   Oh I can see You now
.                 Em          C
   Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
.                G     D
   Laying Yourself down
.               Em        C
   Raising up the broken to life

[V2]
.             Em
 You take our failure
.             G
 You take our weakness
.             Em
 You set Your treasure
.             G
 In jars of clay
.             Em
 So take this heart Lord
.             G
 I'll be Your vessel
.             D                Em  D
 The world to see Your life in me__

 PRE-CHORUS 2:
.G
 Amazing grace
.    D
 How sweet the sound
.    Em                 C
 That saved a wretch like me
.  G
 I once was lost
.    D
 But now I am found
.   Em            C
 Was blind but now I see</lyrics>
