<lyrics>[V1]
.G                       D     G
 God be with you till we meet again;
.C                             G
 By his counsels guide, uphold you;
.D         D7             G
 With his sheep securely fold you.
.G                           D  G
 God be with you till we meet again.

[C1]
.  G                     C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                       D
   Till we meet at Jesus' feet,
.          G             C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                       D     G
   God be with you till we meet again.

[V2]
.G                       D     G
 God be with you till we meet again;
.C                                  G
 When life's perils thick confound you,
.D        D7                  G
 Put his arms unfailing round you.
.G                          D   G
 God be with you till we meet again.

[C2]
.  G                     C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                       D
   Till we meet at Jesus' feet,
.          G             C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                          D   G
   God be with you till we meet again.

[V3]
.G                       D     G
 God be with you till we meet again;
.C                                G
 Keep love's banner floating o'er you;
.D             D7                  G
 Smite death's threat'ning wave before you.
.G                           D  G
 God be with you till we meet again.

[C3]
.  G                     C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                      D
   Till we meet at Jesus' feet,
.          G             C
   Till we meet, till we meet,
.  G                          D   G
   God be with you till we meet again.
.  C      G                   D   G
   God be with you till we meet again.</lyrics>
