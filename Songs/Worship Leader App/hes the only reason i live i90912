<lyrics>[C1]
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason
   There is nothing in this world worth living for
   It only leaves you empty and longing for more
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason.

[V1]
 I've been blessed with so many things,
 God's been good to me
 I have family and friends who share in all I do
 But if I lose it all and I am left with nothing
 If I have the Lord, then I know I'll make it through.

[C2]
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason
   There is nothing in this world worth living for
   It only leaves you empty and longing for more
   He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason.

[V2]
 You may have tried a lot of things to find true happiness
 But if you've looked very long then you know it just can't be found
 Until you find the Lord and the power of His spirit
 He'll be your reason to live and He'll never let you down</lyrics>
