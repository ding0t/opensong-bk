<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh, what a Friend
 Who walks beside me
 To hold my hand,
 And safely guide me.
 Safe in His arms,
 He'll always hide me.
 Oh, what a Friend, He is to me.

[V2]
 He knows the way,
 My road is wending.
 He sees around
 My pathway's bending.
 He'll take me through
 When day is ending.
 Oh, what a Friend, he is to me.</lyrics>
