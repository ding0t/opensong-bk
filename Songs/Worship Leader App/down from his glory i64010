<lyrics>[V1]
 Down from His glory,
 Ever living story,
 My God and Saviour came,
 And Jesus was His Name.
 Born in a manger,
 To His own a stranger,
 A Man of sorrows,
 Tears and agony.

[C1]
   Oh how I love Him!
   How I adore Him!
   My breath, my sunshine,
   My all in all!
   The great Creator
   Became my Saviour,
   And all God's fullness
   Dwelleth in Him.

[V2]
 What condescension,
 Bringing us redemption;
 That in the dead of night,
 Not one faint hope in sight;
 God, gracious, tender,
 Laid aside His splendor,
 Stooping to woo, to win,
 To save my soul.

[V3]
 Without reluctance,
 Flesh and blood His substance,
 He took the form of man,
 Revealed the hidden plan.
 Oh glorious mystery,
 Sacrifice of Calvary,
 And now I know
 Thou art the great &quot;I Am.&quot;</lyrics>
