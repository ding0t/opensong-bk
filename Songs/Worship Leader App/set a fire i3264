<lyrics>[C1]
   Set a fire down in my soul
   That I can't contain, that I can't control
   I want more of You God
   I want more of You God

[V1]
 No place I would rather be
 No place I would rather be
 No place I would rather be
 Than here in Your love, here in Your love
 No place I would rather be
 No place I would rather be
 No place I would rather be
 Than here in Your love, here in Your love

[V2]
 Set a fire down in my soul
 That I can't contain, that I can't control
 I want more of You God

[B1]
   I want more,
   I want more
   I want more,
   I want more, I want more
   I want more, won't You pour it out?</lyrics>
