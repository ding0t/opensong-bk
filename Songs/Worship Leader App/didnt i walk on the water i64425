 As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night
 I'm praying for assurance everything's gonna be alright
 Lord I see another battle out in front of me
 I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat

[V2]
 He said, do you remember where I brought you from
 Just take a look behind you at how far you've come
 And everytime you asked me, didn't I deliver you
 So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through

[C1]
   Didn't I walked on the water and I calmed the raging sea
   I spoke to the wind, it hushed and I gave you peace
   Didn't I run to your rescue didn't I hear you when you called
   I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall
   Didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin
   I searched until I found you and I'd do it all again

[V3]
 Now she's talking to her father in a house that was once a home
 She said my bills are coming due Lord and six days is not that long
 She hears a voice so still and low
 It says I've moved like that before
 And I'll do this little thing and I'll give you so much more

[C2]
   Didn't I walked on the water and I calmed the raging sea
   I spoke to the wind, it hushed and I gave you peace
   Didn't I run to your rescue didn't I hear you when you called
   I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall
   Didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin
   I searched until I found you and I'd do it all again (2X)</lyrics>
