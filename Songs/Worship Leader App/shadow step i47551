   CHORUS
   Tracing all my steps
   Light up the way of Your heart
   Move me like You do the mountains
   Move me like You do the wind
   And I'll chase Your voice through the dark
   Fix my eyes on the unexpected
   In the wonder of Your shadow-step
   (Take another step)

[V1]
 VERSE 1
 You met me at the sinners' table
 I found You waiting by the well
 Unexpected
 You are always there

[V2]
 VERSE 2
 You never left the lost forsaken
 Your mercy paves the road ahead
 Unexpected
 You are always good
 You are always good

[V3]
 POST-CHORUS
 And I won't be afraid
 In every way
 You never fail
 So have Your way here God
 And I'll sing Your praise
 Fix my heart to Yours
 Ready for the unexpected
 Ready for what You will do next

[B1]
   BRIDGE
   I can't explain Your heart
   Or dare to trace-out all You are
   But when I think about
   The road You took for love
   I know Your grace will stay the path</lyrics>
