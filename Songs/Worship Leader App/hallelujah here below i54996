<lyrics>[V1]
.       Bm            G      D
 We are an altar of broken stones
.         Bm            G    A
 But You delight in the offering
.             Bm          G         D
 You have the heavens to call Your home
.          Bm          A       D
 But You abide in the song we sing

[V2]
 Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
 To bring You praise that will never cease
 But hallelujah from here below
 Is still Your favourite melody

[C1]
.  D/F#     G      D    A     D/F#  G     Bm A
   We sing hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
.  D/F#     G      D    A     D/F#  G     Bm A
   We sing hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

[V3]
 And should the fire that once burned bright
 Become an ember my eyes can't see
 I will remember Your sacrifice
 I will abide in Your love for me

[B1]
.           D        Em       D/F#
   Jesus Christ our King enthroned
.            Bm               A    G
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
.        D     Em     D/F#
   Hallelujah here below
.            Bm             A      D
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
   Jesus Christ our King enthroned
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
   Hallelujah here below
   All the praise is Yours forevermore

[V4]
 Oh, what a wonderful day to come
 When every knee bows before Your name
 But we will not wait until it does
 For here and now shall Your Kingdom reign</lyrics>
