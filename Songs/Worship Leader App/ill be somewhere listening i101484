<lyrics>[V1]
 When my Saviour calls I will answer
 When He calls for me I will hear
 When my Saviour calls I will answer
 I´ll be somewhere listening for my name

[C1]
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name

[V2]
 If my heart is right when He calls me,
 If my heart is right, I will hear.
 If my heart is right when He calls me,
 I´ll be somewhere listening for my name

[C2]
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name

[V3]
 If my robe is white, when He calls me
 If my robe is white, I will hear
 If my robe is white, when He calls me
 I´ll be somewhere listening for my name.

[C3]
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening
   I´ll be somewhere listening for my name</lyrics>
