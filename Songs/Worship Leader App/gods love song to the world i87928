.A                          F#m
 You came to settle all the scores
.                       D
 Long before I was even born
.                        Bm
 And You called me by my name
.     E            A
 And told me I am Your's

[V2]
.A                  F#m
 Two thousand years ago

 It was finished, it was done
.                          Bm
 And as I grew up I could learn
.E                A
 You're the Holy One

   And to have learned that You have known me all along
.                F#m                          D
   And that for every step I took You were beside me
.          Bm                          E
   Now forever I will praise You in a song
