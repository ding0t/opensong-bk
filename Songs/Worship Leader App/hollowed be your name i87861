<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Holy Lord
 You're worthy
 And I'm honored
 To sing Your praise
 King of Glory God Almighty
 Hallowed be Your name
 All creation every nation
 Has its being by Your word
 As Your will is done up in heaven
 Let it be done here on earth
 Let it be done on earth

[V2]
 Hallowed be Your name
 Hallowed be Your name
 Hallowed be Your name
 Lord and majesty
 Divine authority
 Hallowed be Your name
 (Repeat)

[V3]
 Holy Holy Lord
 You're worthy
 And I'm honored
 To sing Your praise
 King of Glory God Almighty
 Hallowed be Your name
 Hallowed be Your name
 (Repeat chorus)
 Hallowed be Your name</lyrics>
