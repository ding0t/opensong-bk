<lyrics>[V1]
 In the harvest field now ripend,
 there is work for all to do.
 Hark the voice of God is calling,
 to the harvest calling you.

[C1]
   Chorus
   Little is much when God is in it,
   Labor not for wealth or fame;
   There's a crown and you can win it,
   if you go in Jesus' name.

[V2]
 Does the place you're called to labor
 seem so small and little known?
 It is great if God is in it
 and He'll not forget His own.

[V3]
 When the conflict here is ended
 and our race on earth is run;
 He will say, if you are faithful,
 &quot;welcome home, my child well done&quot;.</lyrics>
