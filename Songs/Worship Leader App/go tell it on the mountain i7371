<title>Go Tell it on the Mountain</title>
<lyrics>[C1]
.  D
   Go tell it on the mountain
.  A                  DAGD
   Over the hills and everywhere
.  D
   Go tell it on the mountain
.              A       D
   That Jesus Christ is born

[V1]
.  D
 While shepherds kept their watching
.     A               D
 O'er silent flocks by night
.  D
 Behold throughout the heavens
.      E       A      A7
 There shone a holy light

[V2]
.    D
 The shepherds feared and trembled
.     A           D
 When lo above the earth
.     D
 Rang out the angel chorus
.     E                    A A7
 That hailed our Savior's birth

[V3]
.     D
 Down in a lowly manger
.    A                D
 The humble Christ was born
.    D
 And brought us God salvation
.     E                 A A7
 That blessed Christmas morn</lyrics>
