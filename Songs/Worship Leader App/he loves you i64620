<lyrics>[V1]
 He set you free
 So you could see
 How much He loves you
 Just take a look
 It's in His book
 How much He loves you
 His Word reveals
 All that He feels
 He spelled it out
 Never a doubt

[C1]
   He loves you
   Just because He loves you
   Just because He loves you
   He loves you
   Just because He loves you
   Just because He loves you
   There's nothing you can do to
   make Him love you more
   There's nothing you can do to
   make Him love you less
   He loves you
   Just because He loves you
   Just because He loves you

[V2]
 Once we were lost
 Needing the cross
 Needing a Savior
 He came to earth
 A humble birth
 Born in a manger
 His words were truth
 His life was proof
 He was God's Son
 Sent for each one</lyrics>
