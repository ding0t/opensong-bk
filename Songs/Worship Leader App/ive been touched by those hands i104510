<lyrics>[V1]
 I was heavy burdened down The hand of Satan had me bound
 I called upon Jesus He had compassion over me
 When His love came rushing in And he took away my sin
 I was changed and Satan knew I´d been set free

[C1]
   I´ve been touched by those hands that were hanging
   From a tree on a lonely hill that day
   He put a song in my heart that keeps singing
   It was Jesus who made me this way

[V2]
 This world can take all the things that I´ve worked for through the years
 They can take this old house I am living in
 But there is one thing I know they´ll never take away from me
 That is Jesus who´s living within</lyrics>
