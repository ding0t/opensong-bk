 // Take a moment to remember
 Who God is and who I am
 There You go lifting my load again //
 There You go lifting my load again

[V2]
 // No longer am I held by
 The yoke of this world
 Come upon you the yoke of Jesus
 His yoke is easy and His burden is so light //
 His burden is so light

[V3]
 // You're lifting my load
 You're lifting my load
 You're lifting my load
 You're lifting my load //

[V4]
 // No longer am I held by
 The yoke of this world
 Come upon you the yoke of Jesus
 His yoke is easy and His burden is so light //

[V5]
 // Your love carries
 Your love carries me
 Out of valleys and the darkest places //</lyrics>
