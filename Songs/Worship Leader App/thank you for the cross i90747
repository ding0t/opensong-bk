<lyrics>[V1]
 Thank You for the cross,
 The price You paid for us
 How You gave Yourself
 So completely
 Precious Lord

[V2]
 Now our sins are gone
 All forgiven
 Covered by Your blood
 All forgotten
 Thank You, Lord (thank You, Lord)

[V3]
 Oh, I love You, Lord
 Really love You, Lord
 I will never understand
 Why You love me

[V4]
 You're my deepest joy
 You're my heart's desire
 And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see
 You delight in me!

[V5]
 For our healing there
 Lord, You suffered
 And to take our fear
 You poured out Your love
 Precious Lord

[V6]
 Calvary's work is done
 You have conquered
 Able now to save
 So completely
 Thank You, Lord
 Thank You, Lord

[V7]
 Oh, I love You, Lord
 Really love You, Lord
 I will never understand
 Why You love me

[V8]
 You're my deepest joy
 You're my heart's desire
 And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see
 You delight in me!

[V9]
 Oh, I love You, Lord
 Really love You, Lord
 I will never understand
 Why You love me

[V10]
 You're my deepest joy
 You're my heart's desire
 And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see
 You delight in me!
 You delight in me!
 You delight in me!
 You delight in me!

[V11]
 I Really love You Lord
 You delight in me!
 You delight in me!

[V12]
 I Really love You Lord
 You delight in me!
 You delight in me!</lyrics>
