 You saw me in my need
 You paid the price for me
 And through Your love
 I have been set free
 Now I am not the same
 You took my sin and shame
 Forever I will bless Your Holy Name

[V2]
 I adore You
 I adore You
 Lamb of God
 My Savior, Prince of Peace

[V3]
 I adore You
 I adore You
 Jesus You mean all the world to me
 I adore You Lord.</lyrics>
