 It was in a simple stable
 All beaten and worn
 Hardly a place
 For a King to be born
 He didnt chose a place special
 To reveal His Majesty
 So I know if I give Him control
 He will be born in me

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Let Your word be born
   in the manger of my heart
   Let it live in me, let it start
   Live inside this house of clay
   and be molded every day
   Let your word be born
   in the manger of my heart

[V2]
 Now outwardly I am nothing
 Not much to behold
 not likely a place
 For His Word to unfold
 But if I'll just yield this vessel
 And let Him have His way
 From glory unto glory
 He'll change me day by day</lyrics>
