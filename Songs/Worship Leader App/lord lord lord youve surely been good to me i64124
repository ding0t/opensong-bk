   Lord, Lord, Lord
   You've surely been
   good to me; (3x)
   You have done what
   this world could not do.

[V1]
 You saved my soul
 when I was lost
 You've surely been
 good to me; (3x)
 You have done what
 this world could not do.

[V2]
 You filled me with the
 Holy Ghost,
 You've surely been
 good to me; (3x)
 You have done what
 this world could not do.

[V3]
 You healed my body
 when I was sick,
 You've surely been
 good to me; (3x)
 You have done what
 this world could not do.</lyrics>
