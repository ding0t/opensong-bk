.  Am   F        G          Am
   Lift high the banners of love Hallelujah
.  F         C           G
   Sound the trumpets of war
.  F                 G      Am
   Christ has gotten us the vict'ry, Hallelujah
.  F   G        Am
   Jericho must fall!

[V1]
.    C       G            D  Am
 The body of Christ is an army
.F        G        Am  Em
 Fighting powers unseen
.C            D           Am
 Bringing the captives to freedom
.       F       G         Am
 In the name of Jesus our King

[V2]
.C          G      D    Am
 Preach the Savior crucified
.F        G      Am  Em
 Dead but risen again
.C                G         Am
 Come against the powers of darkness
.F      G        Am
 In His glorious name</lyrics>
