<title>You're Gonna Love It When God Steps In</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You tried to move your mountain... but your mountain would not move
 You've been to all your doctors... there's no more they can do
 You've had the answer all along... but you have refused
 Why didn't you just... take your problem to the Lord
 And He would have answered you
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 Mountains move... miracles begin
 Raise the dead... Part the sea
 Nothing is beyond... possibility
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 Forgiveness comes... and mercy wins
 When His Blood flows... and conquers sin
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 In every situation... we find in life
 You always have a choice
 We're either listening to the Lord... or another voice
 There is a way... you can be sure... to always know the truth
 Always remember... When you're trusting in Gods Word
 His promise will come true
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 Mountains move... miracles begin
 Raise the dead... Part the sea
 Nothing is beyond... possibility
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 Forgiveness comes and mercy wins
 When His Blood flows... and covers your sin
 You're gonna love it when God steps in
 When His Blood flows... and covers your sin
 You're gonna love it when God steps in</lyrics>
