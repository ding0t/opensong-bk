<lyrics>[C1]
   Let God Arise
   Let God Arise

[V1]
 Let His Enemies be scattered
 But let the righteous be glad
 Yes let them rejoice with Gladness
 God has triumphed mightily

[B1]
   It is good to praise the Lord
   And make music to your Name
   Oh God Most High
   To proclaim your love and faithfulness
   Through the day and through the night

[B2]
   May I dwell in your courts Oh Lord
   Then to flourish like the trees of Lebanon
   Planted in the house of Adonai
   There to live forevermore</lyrics>
