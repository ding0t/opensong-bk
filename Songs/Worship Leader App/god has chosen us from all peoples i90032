<lyrics>[V1]
.A C#m
 God has chosen us from all peoples,
.D E A
  He gave us his heart.
.             A C#m
 God has chosen us from all tribes and languages,
.D E A
  But gave us the name of one!

[V2]
 Chorus:

[V3]
.D E C#m F#m
  When we are together - we are strong!
.D E C#m F#m
  When we are together - the Lord among us!
.D E C#m F#m
  When we are together - flows the love of God
.D E A
  Pour down to us.

[V4]
 We are the church, we are the body of Christ,
 We are redeemed by the blood of His!
 The gates of hell will not prevail against us,
 Because we are invincible!</lyrics>
