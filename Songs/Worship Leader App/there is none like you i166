<lyrics>[C1]
.  G         D        Em
   There is none like You
.  C       G/B              Am7             D
   No one else can touch my heart like You do
.  G       D              Em         C
   I could search for all eternity long
.      G              C   D    G
   And find there is none like You

[V1]
.     C                  G     Em
 Your mercy flows like a river wide
.    Am7      D              G
 And healing comes from your Hands
. Em       C            G            Em
 Suffering children are safe in your arms
.  Am7     C        D7
 There is none like You

[V2]
.    
     C G Em
 When low in spirit I called on your name
 Am D G
 and you heard my prayer
.    
     Em C G Em
 You lifted me up and you set me free.
 Am7 C D7
 There is none like you.</lyrics>
