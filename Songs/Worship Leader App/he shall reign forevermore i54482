<lyrics>[V1]
.Em           C   G       D
 In the bleak mid-winter, all creation groans
 For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone
.     Am      C     G             D
 Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne

[V2]
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
 Unto us a child is born
 The King of kings and Lord of lords
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
.Em        C       G         D
 If I were a wise man, I would travel far
.Em        C       G         Bm
 And if I were a shepherd, I would do my part
.      Am       C       G           D
 But poor as I am, I will give to Him my heart

[C1]
.  Em          C
   Here within a manger lies
.  G           D
   The One who made the starry skies
   This baby born for sacrifice
   Christ, the Messiah
   Into our hopes, into our fears
   The Savior of the world appears
   The promise of eternal years
   Christ, the Messiah</lyrics>
