<lyrics>[V1]
.G             D            Em
 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
.              C      D         G
 A banner that flies across the sky;
.G                  D                 Em
 That all men might see the truth and know,
.          C      D      G
 He is the way to heaven.

[C1]
.  G             D             Em           C     D      G
   We wanna see, we wanna see, we wanna see Jesus lifted high!
.  G               D           Em           C     D      G
   We wanna see, we wanna see, we wanna see Jesus lifted high!

[V2]
.G       D                 Em
 Step by step we're moving forward,
.          C            D      G
 Little by little we're taking ground;
.G     D                    Em
 Every prayer is a powerful weapon,
.                 C
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
.    D
 And down and down and down</lyrics>
