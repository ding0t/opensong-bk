 He is my everything, He is my all
 He is my everything both great and small
 He gave His life for me,
 made everything new
 He is my everything, now,
 how about you?

[C1]
   Like honey in the rock,
   sweet honey in the rock
   For He tastes like honey in the rock
   Oh taste and see, that the Lord is good
   For He tastes like honey in the rock

[V2]
 Some folks may ask me,
 some folks may say
 Who is this Jesus,
 you talk about everyday
 He is my Saviour, and He sets me free
 Listen, I'll tell you now,
 what He means to me.</lyrics>
