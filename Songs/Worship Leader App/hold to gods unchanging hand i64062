<title>Hold To God's Unchanging Hand</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Time is filled with swift transition,
 Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
 Build your hopes on things eternal,
 Hold to God's unchanging hand!

[C1]
   Hold to God's unchanging hand!
   Hold to God's unchanging hand!
   Build your hopes on things eternal,
   Hold to God's unchanging hand!

[V2]
 Trust in Him who will not leave you,
 Whatsoever years may bring,
 If by earthly friends forsaken,
 Still more closely to Him cling!

[V3]
 Covet not this world's vain riches,
 That so rapidly decay,
 Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
 They will never pass away!

[V4]
 When your journey is completed,
 If to God you have been true,
 Fair and bright the home in glory,
 Your enraptured soul will view!</lyrics>
