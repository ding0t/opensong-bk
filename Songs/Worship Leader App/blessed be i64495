   Blessed Be
   Blessed Be
   Blessed Be Your Name (2x)

[V1]
 You, Oh Lord, are a strong and
 mighty tower
 an ever present help
 in my darkest hour
 You're my hiding place,
 You're the ancient of days.
 You're the rock on which I'm
 standing,
 You are worthy of my praise.

[V2]
 You, Oh Lord, are the deep that I
 have searched for.
 The ever flowing fountain that
 my heart always thirst for.
 You're The One that makes me
 whole,
 You're The Lover of my soul,
 And whatever comes my way,
 I know You're in control

[B1]
   Let your people proclaim
   You are Holy
   You are Holy God
   And we lift up Your Name
   And give glory
   Glory to Your Name</lyrics>
