<lyrics>[V1]
 Grace, what have You done?
 Murdered for me on the cross
 Accused in absence of wrong
 My sin washed away in Your blood
 Too much to make sense of it all
 I know that Your love breaks my fall
 The scandal of grace
 You died in my place
 So my soul will live

[V2]
 Chorus:
 All to be like You
 Give all I have just to know You
 Jesus, there's no one besides You
 Forever the hope in my heart

[V3]
 Verse 2:
 Death, where is your sting?
 Your power is as dead as my sin
 The cross has taught me to live
 In mercy my heart now to sing
 The day and its troubles shall come
 I know that Your strength is enough
 The scandal of grace
 You died in my place
 So my soul will live

[V4]
 Bridge:
 And it's all because of You, Jesus
 It's all because of You, Jesus
 It's all because of Your love that my soul will live
 All to be like You
 Give all I have just to know You
 Jesus, there's no one besides You
 Forever the hope in my heart</lyrics>
