.C                  F                C
 A country where no twilight shadows deepen
.                                    G
 Unending day where night will never be
.  C             F                 C
 A city where no storm clouds ever gather
.                  G               C F C
 This is just what Heaven means to m - e

[V2]
.C                        F                C
 It's a place where there is no misunder - standing
.                                     G
 And from all enmity and strife we're free
.   C               F                    C
 No unkind words to wound our hearts are spoken
.                  G               C F C
 This is just what Heaven means to m - e

[C1]
.  C                    F           C
   What will it be when we get over yonder
.                                       G
   And join the throng upon the glass - y sea
.        C                   F                C
   We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever
.                    G               C F C
   This is just what Heaven means to m - e

[V3]
.C                     F               C
 And then at last I'll see the face of  Jesus
.                                       G
 And before whose image other loves all flee
.        C                   F           C
 Ah, but when they crown Him Lord of All I'll be there
.                  G               C F C
 This is just what Heaven means to m - e

[C2]
.  C                    F           C
   What will it be when we get over yonder
.                                             G
   And we'll join the throng upon the glass - y sea
.        C                   F                C
   We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever
.                    G               C F C
   This is just what Heaven means to m - e</lyrics>
