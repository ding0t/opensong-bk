 You set me apart
 Gave me a new heart
 Filled with compassion
 To share Your great love
 Show me Your ways
 I want to know You
 Guide me in truth
 My hope is in You

[C1]
   That I may dwell in Your house forever
   Lifting up Your Name
   Dwell in Your house forevermore

[V2]
 I'll hold on to You
 My strength and my refuge
 Whom shall I fear
 I know You are near
 All of my days
 I live for You Lord
 Establish my path
 There's one thing I ask

[B1]
   Holy Spirit have Your way
   Sweet anointing teach our hearts
   Our lives we pray</lyrics>
