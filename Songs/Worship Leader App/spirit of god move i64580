<lyrics>[C1]
   Spirit of God, move
   Write your words in my heart
   Fill my whole being
   consume my life.
   Spirit of God, move
   An empty vessel I want to be,
   So that you can come,
   Lord and fill me.

[V1]
 I lift my hands, I surrender
 laying all on the altar
 I don't want to pretend
 but be sealed by your hand
 I'll take your word,
 and I'll hide it in my heart.
 Till every fiber in my being
 Has desperate cry

[V2]
 I've recognised your voice
 and I've understood the call
 Lord help me not to faint
 but stand and overcome
 Lord, I just want to please you
 That's all I want to do
 So from my soul now,
 I cry to You</lyrics>
