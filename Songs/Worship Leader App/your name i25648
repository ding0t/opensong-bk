 As morning dawns and evenings fades
 You inspire songs of praise
 That rise from earth to touch Your heart
 And glorify Your name

[C1]
   Your name, is a strong and mighty tower
   Your name, is a shelter like no other
   Your name, let the nations sing it louder
   'Cause nothing has the power to save
   But Your name

[V2]
 Jesus, in Your name we pray
 Come and fill our hearts today
 Lord, give us strength to live for You
 And glorify Your name

[C2]
   Your name, is a strong and mighty tower
   Your name, is a shelter like no other
   Your name, let the nations sing it louder
   'Cause nothing has the power to save
   But Your name</lyrics>
