<title>This Blood</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.           E          A      E
 There is a blood that cost a life
.             B             E
 That paid my way Death its price
.        E                    A
 When it flowed down from the cross
.             E             B
 My sins were gone, my sins forgot

[V2]
.           E          A        E
 There is a grave that tried to hide
.              B                  E
 This precious blood that gave me life
.         E                A
 In three days He breathed again
.            E           B
 And rose to stand in my defense

[C1]
.       E       A             E
   So I come to tell you He's alive
.              B/D#    C#m
   To tell you that He dries
.        E/B       A
   Every tear that falls
.       E       A                E
   So I come to tell you that He saves
.               B/D#  C#m
   To shout and to proclaim
.                   E/B      A
   That He's coming back for you

[V3]
.           E          A          E
 There is a blood that sights the blind
.               B                E
 That heals the sick, the lonely finds
.           E                 A
 It has the power to free the bound
.               E             B
 As chains they fall upon the ground

[V4]
.           E      A          E
 So pour it out to cleanse my soul
.            B            E
 And let His liquid glory flow
.           E                A
 Because He lives to make me whole
.         E              B
 I owe my life, I owe my all

[C2]
.       E       A             E
   So I come to tell you He's alive
.              B/D#    C#m
   To tell you that He dries
.        E/B       A
   Every tear that falls
.       E       A                E
   So I come to tell you that He saves
.               B/D#  C#m
   To shout and to proclaim
.                   E/B      A
   That He's coming back for you
   (2x)

[B1]
.  E
   What can wash away my sin?
.  C#m      A
   Nothing, nothing
.  E
   What can make me whole again?
.  C#m                    A
   Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood
   (2x)

[V5]
.           E          A        E
 There is a grave that tried to hide

 This precious blood that gave me life
.         E                A
 In three days He breathed again
.            E           B
 And rose to stand in my defense
