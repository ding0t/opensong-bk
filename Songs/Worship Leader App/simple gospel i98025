.A Bm7 F#m7 D2
  
.A
 I want to know You, Lord
.Bm7
 Like I know a friend
.F#m7                    D2
 I want to know You, Lord

[C1]
.  A
   So I'm laying down
.  Bm7
   All my religion
.  F#m7
   I'm laying down
.  D2
   I want to know You, Lord

[V2]
.A
 I used to think
.Bm7
 That I could box You in
.F#m7
 But I'm laying down
.D2
 I want to know You, Lord

[V3]
.A
 Lord, I've been told
.Bm7
 To be ashamed
.F#m7
 Lord, I've been told
.D2
 I don't measure up
.A
 Lord, I've been told
.Bm7
 I'm not good enough
.F#m7                   D2
 But You're here with me

[B1]
.  A
   I reach out,
.  Bm7
   And You
.  F#m7            D2
   Find me in the dust
.  A
   And You say no amount
.  Bm7         F#m7         D2
   Of untruths can separate us

[C2]
.  A
   I will rejoice
.  Bm7
   In the simple gospel
.  F#m7
   I will rejoice
.  D2
   In You, Lord</lyrics>
