 I'm in a fight not physical,
 I'm in a war but not with this world,
 You are the light that is beautiful,
 And I want more,
 I want all that is yours

[C1]
   Joy unspeakable that won't go away,
   And just enough strength to live for today,
   So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
   'cause my faith is on solid rock,
   I am counting on God,
   I am counting on, I am counting on God
   I am counting on, I am counting on God
   I am counting on, I am counting on God
   I am counting on, I am counting on God

[V2]
 In the miracle of christ in me,
 Is the mystery that sets me free,
 I'm nothing like I use to be,
 Just open up your eyes,
 You'll see
 In the miracle of christ in me,
 Is the mystery that sets me free,
 I'm nothing like I use to be,
 Just open up your eyes,
 You'll see</lyrics>
