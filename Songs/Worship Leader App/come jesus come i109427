<lyrics>[V1]
.              G                   C
 Sometimes I fall, to my knees and pray
.            G   D
 Come, Jesus come
.                 G
 Let today be the day
.    G/B     C                    Em7
 Sometimes I feel, like I'm gonna break
.               Dsus C
 But I'm holding on__
.                     G
 To a hope that won't fade

[C1]
.               C
   Come, Jesus, come
.                        G
   We've been waiting so long
.                  Dsus
   For the day You return
.                                      Em  D C
   to heal every hurt and right every wrong
.                    C
   We need You right now
.                      G
   Come and turn this around
.              Dsus
   Deep down I know, this world isn't home
.               Em  D C
   Come, Jesus, come
.               G
   Come, Jesus, come

[V2]
.               G                       C
 There'll be no war, and there'll be no chains
.           G    D
 When Jesus comes
.                 G
 Let today be the day
.                   G/B
 He'll come for the weak
.        C               Em7
 And the strong just the same
.              Dsus  C G
 And all will believe
.                    G
 In the power of His name

[V3]
.              G
 One day He'll come
.                        C
 And we'll stand face to face
.                   G
 'Cause it might be today

 The time is right now

 Your past will be washed

 By rivers of grace
