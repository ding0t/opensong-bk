 Hear my cry oh Lord
 Attend unto my prayer
 From the end of the earth
 Will I cry out to thee
 When my heart is overwhelmed
 Lead me to the rock
 That is higher than I
 That is higher than I

[V2]
 For thou has been
 A shelter for me
 And a strong tower
 From the enemy
 When my heart is overwhelmed
 Lead me to the rock
 That is higher than I
 That is higher than I</lyrics>
