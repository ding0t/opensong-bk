 Joy is the flag flown high
 From the castle of my heart
 From the castle of my heart
 From the castle of my heart
 Joy is the flag flown high
 From the castle of my heart
 When the King is in residence there

[C1]
   (So) let it fly in the sky
   Let the whole world know
   Let the whole world know
   Let the whole world know
   (So) let it fly in the sky
   Let the whole world know
   That the King is in residence there.</lyrics>
