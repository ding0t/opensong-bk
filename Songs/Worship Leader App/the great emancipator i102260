 Once my heart and life was fettered
 By all binding chains of sin
 But the great Emancipator
 Set me free to worship Him

[V2]
 Glory,glory hallelujah
 Blessed be His Holy Name
 He's the great Emancipator
 That's the song of the redeemed

[V3]
 Like a lost lamb I was drifting
 Oh so helpless and alone
 But the seeking shepherd found me
 Brought me to my Father's Home

[V4]
 Glory,glory hallelujah
 Blessed be His Holy Name
 He's the great Emancipator
 That's the song of the redeemed</lyrics>
