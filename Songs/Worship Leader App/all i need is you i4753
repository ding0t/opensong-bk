<title>All I Need Is You</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Left my fear by the side of the road
 Hear You speak
 Won't let go
 Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray
 Got every reason to be here again
 Father's heart that pulls me in
 And all my eyes want to see is a glimpse of You

[C1]
   All I need is You
   All I need is You Lord
   Is you Lord

[V2]
 One more day and it's not the same
 Your spirit calls my heart to sing
 Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again
 Where would my soul be without Your Son
 Gave His life to save the earth
 Rest in the thought that You're watching over me

[B1]
   You hold the universe
   You hold everyone on earth
   You hold the universe
   You hold
   You hold</lyrics>
