<lyrics>[V1]
 For so long I carried the weight of my past
 Cripple by burdens like stones on my back
 I thought I had fallen too far from your grace
 but you came and showed me the way

[P1]
   When i was a lost soul searching
   You were the ground beneath my feet
   When i was blind man begging
   You were the eyes so I could see
   When the smoke was rising up
   You were the air that I could breath
   You gave me hope You gave me strength
   and I believe

[C1]
   I'M ALIVE AND BORN AGAIN
   RESCUED FROM THE GRIP OF SIN
   GOD YOUR LOVE CAME CRASHING IN
   AND PULLED ME OUT OF THE FIRE
   I'M A SURVIVOR

[V2]
 All I can see are the fields of your grace
 Wherever I run your leading the way
 You shook the shackles off my feet
 I found redemption on my knees
 You gave me hope You gave me strength
 and I believe

[C2]
   I'M ALIVE AND BORN AGAIN
   RESCUED FROM THE GRIP OF SIN
   GOD YOUR LOVE CAME CRASHING IN
   AND PULLED ME OUT OF THE FIRE
   I'M A SURVIVOR

[B1]
   You're my God
   You're my Fighter
   You make me a survivor</lyrics>
