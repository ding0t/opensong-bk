<lyrics>[V1]
 I stand upon the solid rock
 Of faith in Christ
 This steadfast hope shall not
 Break apart within the trial
 I am assured
 His promises will never fail
 As long as life remains
 He is faithful

[C1]
   God is patient
   God is kind
   He does not envy
   He does not boast
   His ways are higher than my own
   His thoughts consume the great unknown
   Of this alone I am sure
   My God is love

[V2]
 I draw my breath under His
 Created windswept sky
 I know my hope shall last
 Long after my flesh retires
 From dusk until the dawn
 He calls His children home
 His righteous love outlasts generations

[B1]
   He is Almighty God
   Elohim
   Maker of the earth
   He is the Lord of hosts
   Heaven's King
   God of endless worth
   His kingdom stands above
   Every power
   Every living soul
   His love is like the sun
   Ever true
   Shining over all</lyrics>
