<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 His heart was broken, mine was mended
 He became sin now I am clean
 The cross He carried bore my burden
 The nails that held Him set me free

[C1]
   His life for mine, His life for mine
   How could it ever be that He would die
   God's Son would die to save a wretch like me
   What love divine He gave His life for mine

[V2]
 His scars of suffering brought me healing
 He spilled His blood to fill my soul
 His crown of thorns made me royalty
 His sorrow gave me joy untold

[V3]
 He was despised and rejected
 Stripped of His garment and oppressed
 I am loved and accepted
 And I wear a robe of righteousness</lyrics>
