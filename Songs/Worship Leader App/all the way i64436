<lyrics>[V1]
 All the Way, I'm going all the way (x3),
 I'm going all the way with the Lord.

[V2]
 No turning back, I'm going all the way (3x),
 I'm going all the way with the Lord.

[V3]
 I've made my choice, I'm going all the way (3x),
 I'm going all the way with the lord.

[V4]
 I've made my decision, I'm going all the way (3x),
 I'm going all the way with the Lord.</lyrics>
