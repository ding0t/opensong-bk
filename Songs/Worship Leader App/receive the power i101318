<lyrics>[V1]
 Every nation, every tribe,
 come together to worship You.
 In Your presence we delight:
 we will follow
 to the ends of the earth.

[C1]
   Alleluia, Alleluia!
   Receive the power, from the Holy Spirit!
   Alleluia, Alleluia!
   Receive the power to be a light unto the world.

[V2]
 As Your Spirit calls to rise
 we will answer and do Your will.
 We'll forever testify
 of Your mercy and unfailing love.

[B1]
   Lamb of God, we worship you.
   Holy one, we worship you.
   Bread of Life, we worship you.
   Emmanuel, we worship you.
   Lamb of God, we worship you.
   Holy one, we worship you.
   Bread of life, we worship you.
   Emmanuel, we will sing forever!</lyrics>
