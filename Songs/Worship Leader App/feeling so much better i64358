<lyrics>[V1]
 Feeling so much better
 Talking about this good old Way,
 Feeling so much better
 Talking about the Lord;
 Let's go on, let's go on
 Talking about this good old Way,
 Let's go on, let's go on
 Talking about the Lord.

[V2]
 The devil he don't like it,
 Talking about this good old Way,
 The devil he don't like it,
 Talking about the Lord.
 So, let's go on, let's go on
 Talking about this good old Way,
 Let's go on, let's go on
 Talking about the Lord.</lyrics>
