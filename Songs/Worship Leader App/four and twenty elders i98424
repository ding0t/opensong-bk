 1 See four and twenty Elders on their knees.
 See four and twenty Elders on their knees;
 And we'll all rise together, and face the risin' sun.
 O Lord, have mercy, if you please.

[V2]
 2 They are bowin' roun' the altar on their knees.
 They are bowin' roun' the altar on their knees;
 And we'll all rise together, and face the risin' sun.
 O Lord, have mercy, if you please.

[V3]
 3 They are cryin' &quot;Holy, holy,&quot; on their knees.
 They are cryin' &quot;Holy, holy,&quot; on their knees;
 And we'll all rise together, and face the risin' sun.
 O Lord, have mercy, if you please.</lyrics>
