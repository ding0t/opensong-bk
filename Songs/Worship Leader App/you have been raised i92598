 VERSE 1
 How do we know we've been forgiven?
 How do we know that we've been made clean?
 How do we know we'll go to heaven?
 How do we know we've been redeemed?

[C1]
   CHORUS
   You have been raised, the tomb has been opened
   Nothing can take away our hope in You
   You have been raised
   You have been raised, the work is completed
   Hell and its powers have been defeated
   You have been raised

[V2]
 VERSE 2
 Now we are free from condemnation
 There is no judgment left for us to fear
 We don't have to wonder if we're welcome
 You are the One who's brought us near

[B1]
   BRIDGE
   The price You paid for us
   Has fully been accepted
   Because of Your shed blood
   We cannot be rejected</lyrics>
