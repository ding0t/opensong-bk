<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm alive, I'm alive
 Because I'me free

[V2]
 Once a man came to Jesus
 Saying I'll follow you my Lord
 But soon he turned back on his word
 He chose his wealth rather than his soul
 Another night a religious priest came to Jesus
 Seeking an answer for his life
 But he did it in the darkness
 Because of his shame
 Before those who thought to keep the truth

[V3]
 So be born born born born again
 Be born born born born again
 Be born, why don't you be born again?
 Born born give me your life

[V4]
 A man called David awaiting his promise
 Running away from the king he regarded as father
 He believed to be a king till the end
 In spite of the desert
 Because he trusted in his God
 Oh friend

[V5]
 When you trust beyond what you see
 When you do what you'd never've thought to do
 Letting people see your need and love for Jesus
 Without shame, that means you are born

[V6]
 So be born born born born again
 Be born born born born again
 Be born why don't you be born again?
 Born born give me your life</lyrics>
