<title>The Lord Is Here</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord is here
 is dwelling in this place,
 The Lord is here
 is dwelling in this place

[V2]
 He's come to health
 He's come to free
 He's come to break every principality
 He's come to health
 He comes to free the captives

[V3]
 We are freeeeeeee!!!
 My power's on the name of Jesus,,
 He comes..</lyrics>
