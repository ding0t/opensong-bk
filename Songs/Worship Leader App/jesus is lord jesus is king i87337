 The winds of change
 Will sweep the earth
 Jesus will be coming soon again
 Every knee will bow,
 Every tongue confess:

[C1]
   // Jesus is Lord, Jesus is King
   Hellelujah
   Jesus is Lord, Jesus is King //
   Hallelujah/

[V2]
 Soon the trumpets
 Will raise a sound
 Nations will be coming
 Before our King
 In worship and praise,
 We will dance and sing:</lyrics>
