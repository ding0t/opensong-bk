<lyrics>[V1]
 If my people will humble themselves
 Humble themselves and pray
 If they seek my face and humble themselves
 And turn from their wicked ways
 I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins
 I will hear from heaven and heal their land

[C1]
   Lord, heal our land
   Father, heal our land
   Hear our cry and turn our nation back to You
   Lord, heal our land
   Hear us oh, Lord, and heal our land
   Forgive our sin and heal our broken land

[V2]
 Lord, we bow our knee, we humble ourselves
 Humble ourselves and pray
 Lord, we seek your face and humble ourselves
 And turn from our wicked ways
 Father in Your mercy, forgive our sins
 Father in Your mercy, come heal our land</lyrics>
