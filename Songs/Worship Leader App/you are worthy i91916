<title>You Are Worthy</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Any crown I've ever worn
 I lay it down
 Any praise I've ever gained
 I give it all to You
 For there's nothing in this world
 That can compare
 For You alone are worthy
 You alone are worthy

[V2]
 You are near to all who call
 Upon Your name
 Ever giving, ever loving
 You remain the same
 For You open up Your hands
 And satisfy
 I give You all the glory
 Give You all the glory

[V3]
 You are worthy oh Lord
 Of all honour
 You are worthy to receive
 All praise
 In Your presence I live
 And with all I have to give
 I will worship You

[V4]
 Honour You
 Glorify Your holy name
 I will worship You
 Honor You
 Glorify Your holy name</lyrics>
