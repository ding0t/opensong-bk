<lyrics>[V1]
 If that same Spirit
 That raised Christ from the dead
 Dwell in you, dwell in you;
 If that same spirit
 That raised Christ from the dead
 Dwell in you, dwell in you.

[V2]
 It shall quicken your mortal body
 If that Spirit dwell in you;
 It shall quicken your mortal body
 If that Spirit dwell in you.</lyrics>
