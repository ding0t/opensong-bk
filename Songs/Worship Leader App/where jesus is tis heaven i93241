<title>Where Jesus Is, 'Tis Heaven</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 1- Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
 This world has been a Heav'n to me;
 And 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe,
 'Tis Heav'n my Jesus here to know.

[C1]
   Oh, hallelujah, yes, 'tis Heav'n,
   'Tis Heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
   On land or sea, what matters where?-
   Where Jesus is, 'tis Heaven there.

[V2]
 2- Once Heaven seemed a far-off place,
 Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
 Now it's begun within my soul,
 'Twill last while endless ages roll.

[V3]
 3- What matters where on earth we dwell?
 On mountaintop, or in the dell,
 In cottage, or a mansion fair,
 Where Jesus is, 'tis Heaven there.</lyrics>
