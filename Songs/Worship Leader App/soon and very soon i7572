<lyrics>[V1]
 Soon and very soon we are going to see the king
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king

[V2]
 No more crying there, we are going to see the king
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king

[V3]
 Should there be any rivers we must cross
 Should there be any mountains we must climb
 God will supply all the strength that we need
 Give us strength till we reach the other side.
 We have come from every nation,
 God has already signed our name.
 Jesus took his blood and he washed my sins, he washed them all away.
 Yet there are those of us who have laid down our lives
 But we all shall meet again on the other side.
 Back to the chorus
 Should there be any rivers we must cross
 Should there be any mountains we must climb
 God will supply all the strength that we need
 Give us strength till we reach the other side.</lyrics>
