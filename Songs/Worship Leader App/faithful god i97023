 I am surrounded
 On every side, can't see the light of day
 But I am persuaded
 Beyond all hope, You won't let go of me
 I stake my claim on every word You say
 You will not be late

[C1]
   I will sing through ﬁre and thunder
   'Cause You are on my side
   I trust You with my life
   I know my story, it isn't over
   Even against all odds
   You are a faithful God
   You're faithful God

[V2]
 The darkest of weather
 Though I can't see, I still believe You're good
 So I'm moving forward
 Through crashing waves, I know I'm safe with You
 You hold my life, You hear my cry
 With every breath inside

[B1]
   I am convinced that Your promises will hold together
   And I will dwell in the hope of Your love forever
   I am convinced that Your promises will hold together
   And I will dwell in Your love</lyrics>
