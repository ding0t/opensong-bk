<lyrics>[V1]
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 He healed my body, He touched my mind
 He saved me just in time
 I'm gonna praise His name
 Each day is just the same
 Come on and praise Him
 Look what the Lord has done.

[V2]
 The lame man set outside the gate

[V3]
 Begging alms of those who entered in
 Now Peter and John they came upon him
 The lame man expecting form them
 Peter said silver and gold have I none
 But such I have Give unto Thee
 Right then the spirit touched him
 And he leaped to his feet
 Saying look what Gods done for me.

[V4]
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 He healed my body, He touched my mind
 He saved me just in time
 I'm gonna praise His name
 Each day is just the same
 Come on and praise Him
 Look what the Lord has done.

[V5]
 I was bound by chains of darkness and sin
 I had no hope or peace of mind
 Though my sins were red as scarlet
 He washed them white as snow
 And opened my blind eyes
 Now my soul will rejoice since I've made Him my choice
 I've got joy, peace, everything that's within
 You see my names been written down
 In the lambs book of life
 Can't you see what Gods done for me.

[V6]
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 He healed my body, He touched my mind
 He saved me just in time
 I'm gonna praise His name
 Each day is just the same
 Come on and praise Him
 Look what the Lord has done.

[V7]
 Come on and praise Him
 Look what the Lord has done...</lyrics>
