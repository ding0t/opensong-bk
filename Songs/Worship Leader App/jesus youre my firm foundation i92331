   Jesus, You're My Firm Foundation,
   I Know I Can Stand Secure;
   Jesus, You're My Firm Foundation,
   I Put My Hope In Your Holy Word,
   I Put My Hope In Your Holy Word.

[V1]
 I have a Living Hope,
 (I have a Living Hope, )
 I Have a future;
 (I Have a future;)
 God Has A Plan For Me,
 (God Has A Plan For Me,)
 Of This I'm Sure,
 (Of This I'm Sure.)

[V2]
 Your Word is Faithful,
 (Your Word is Faithful,)
 Mighty in Power;
 (Mighty in Power;)
 God has deliver Me,
 (God has deliver Me,)
 Of This I'm Sure,
 (Of This I'm Sure.)</lyrics>
