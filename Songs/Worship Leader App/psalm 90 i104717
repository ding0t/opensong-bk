<title>Psalm 90</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You have been our dwelling place
 Oh everlasting God
 Before You formed the mountain tops
 You were before it all
 And soon our lives turn back to dust

[C1]
   When the sun comes up
   Satisfy us
   Before the day has passed us by
   Before our hearts forget
   All Your goodness
   Satisfy us with Your love

[V2]
 The wrath of God poured out for sin
 On Jesus crucified
 Consider Him our hiding place
 Our shelter is alive
 Because He lived and died for us

[V3]
 Teach us Lord
 To number our days on earth
 Give us more
 Wisdom in the secret heart
 As You display amazing grace
 Through Jesus Christ for us

[C2]
   When the sun comes up
   Satisfy us
   Before the day has passed us by
   Before our hearts give up
   Spirit fill us
   Satisfy us with Your love</lyrics>
