<lyrics>[V1]
 If my people who bear My Name
 Will humble themselves and pray
 If they seek My Presence
 and turn their backs on their wicked ways

[C1]
   Then I will hear
   from heaven I'll hear
   from heaven and will forgive
   I will forgive
   their sins and will heal
   their land, yes, I will heal
   their land</lyrics>
