<title>Holy One of Israel</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy One of Israel, that was sacrificed for me;
 Lamb of God, the Messiah, Jesus, our Prince of Peace.
 I will bow down to worship You, oh Lord! For You are the King of kings.
 I will bow down to worship You, my God! Precious Jesus, our Prince of Peace.</lyrics>
