<title>Sovereign Over Us</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 There is strength within the sorrow
 There is beauty in our tears
 And You meet us in our mourning
 With a love that casts out fear
 You are working in our waiting
 You're sanctifying us

[C1]
   When beyond our understanding
   You're teaching us to trust
   Your plans are still to prosper
   You have not forgotten us
   You're with us in the fire and the flood
   You're faithful forever
   Perfect in love
   You are sovereign over us

[V2]
 You are wisdom unimagined
 Who could understand Your ways
 Reigning high above the Heavens
 Reaching down in endless grace
 You're the lifter of the lowly
 Compassionate and kind
 You surround and You uphold me
 And Your promises are my delight

[C2]
   // Your plans are still to prosper
   You have not forgotten us
   You're with us in the fire and the flood
   You're faithful forever
   Perfect in love
   You are sovereign over us //

[B1]
   // Even what the enemy means for evil
   You turn it for our good
   You turn it for our good and for Your glory
   Even in the valley, You are faithful
   You're working for our good
   You're working for our good and for Your glory //

[C3]
   Your plans are still to prosper
   You have not forgotten us
   You're with us in the fire and the flood
   You're faithful forever
   Perfect in love
   You are sovereign over us
   You're faithful forever
   Perfect in love
   You are sovereign over us</lyrics>
