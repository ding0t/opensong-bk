<lyrics>[V1]
 There is no problem so big, God cannot solve it
 There is no mountain so tall, He cannot move it
 There is no storm so dark, God cannot calm it
 There is no sorrow so deep, God cannot soothe it

[C1]
   If He carried the weight of the world
   Upon His shoulders
   I know my brother, that He will carry you
   If He carried the weight of the world
   Upon His shoulders
   I know, my sister, that He will carry you</lyrics>
