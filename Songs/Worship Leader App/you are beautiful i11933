<lyrics>[V1]
 I see Your face in every sunrise
 The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
 The world awakens in the light of the day
 I look up to the sky and say
 You're beautiful

[V2]
 I see Your power in the moonlit night
 Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
 We are amazed in the light of the stars
 It's all proclaiming who You are
 You're beautiful, You're beautiful

[V3]
 I see you there hanging on a tree
 You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me
 Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
 Soon we will be coming home
 You're beautiful, you're beautiful

[V4]
 When we arrive at eternity's shore
 Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
 We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
 Your bride...</lyrics>
