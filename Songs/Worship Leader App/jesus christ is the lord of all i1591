 Clap your hands all ye people
 Shout to God with a voice of triumph
 Clap your hands all ye people
 Sing for joy to the Lord

[C1]
   // Singing halleluiah
   Halleluiah //

[V2]
 Jesus Christ is the Lord of all
 Lord of all the earth
 Jesus Christ is the Lord of all
 Lord of all the earth

[B1]
   Only one God
   Over the nations
   Only one Lord of all
   In no other name
   Is there salvation
   Jesus is Lord of all</lyrics>
