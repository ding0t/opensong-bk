 VERSE 1:
 You bought my life with the
 Blood that You shed on the cross
 When You died for the sins of men
 And You let out a cry
 Crucified now alive in me

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 These hands are Yours
 Teach them to serve as You please
 And I'll reach out desperate to see
 All the greatness of God
 May my soul rest assured in You

[V3]
 PRE CHORUS:
 I'll never be the same
 No I'll never be the same

[V4]
 CHORUS:
 'Cause I know that You're alive
 You came to fix my broken life
 And I sing to glorify
 Your holy Name
 Jesus Christ

[V5]
 VERSE 3:
 You've changed it all
 You broke down the wall
 When I spoke and confessed
 In You I'm blessed
 Now I walk in the light
 In victorious sight of You

[V6]
.BRIDGE:
 Your fire fall down
 Fire fall down
 On us we pray
 As we seek
 Show me Your heart
 Show me Your way
 Show me Your glory</lyrics>
