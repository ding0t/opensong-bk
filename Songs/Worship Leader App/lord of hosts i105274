<lyrics>[V1]
 O come behold the works of God
 the nations at His feet.
 He breaks the bow and bends the spear
 and tells the wars to cease.

[V2]
 O Mighty One of Israel
 you are on our side.
 We walk by faith in God who burns the chariots with fire

[C1]
   Lord of Hosts, You're with us
   with us in the fire,
   with us as a shelter,
   with us in the storm.
   You will lead us
   through the fiercest battle,
   oh where else would we go,
   but with the Lord of Hosts.

[V3]
 O God of Jacob, fierce and great,
 You lift Your voice to speak.
 The earth it bows and all
 the mountains move into the sea

[V4]
 O Lord You know the hearts of men
 and still you let them live.
 O God, who makes the mountains melt
 come wrestle us and win.
 O God who makes the mountains melt
 come wrestle us and win.

[C2]
   Lord of Hosts, You're with us
   with us in the fire,
   with us as a shelter,
   with us in the storm.
   You will lead us
   through the fiercest battle.
   Oh where else would we go,
   but with the Lord of Hosts.

[B1]
   Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all,
   the one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still.
   Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea,
   the nations rage, I know my God is in control.
   Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all,
   the one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still.
   Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea,
   the nations rage, I know my God is in control.

[C3]
   Lord of Hosts, You're with us
   with us in the fire,
   with us as a shelter,
   with us in the storm.
   You will lead us
   through the fiercest battle.
   Oh where else would we go,
   but with the Lord of Hosts.

[C4]
   You are with us
   with us in the fire,
   with us as a shelter,
   with us in the storm.
   You will lead us
   through the fiercest battle.
   Oh where else could we go,
   but with the Lord of Hosts.</lyrics>
