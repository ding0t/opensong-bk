..G
 Jesus gotta hold of my life
..                    D
 And He won't let me go
..D7
 Jesus got into my heart
..              G
 He got into my soul

[V2]
 I used to be oh so sad
..        C
 But now I'm just a free and glad
..      G                      D
 'Cause Jesus gotta hold of my life
..                   G
 And He won't let me go</lyrics>
