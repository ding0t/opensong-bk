 The heavens declare
 The glory of God
 And all of the world
 Will join the praise
 His wonders proclaim

[V2]
 The oceans and skies
 Lift up their voice
 And all He has made
 Will rise to bless
 The King of all kings

[C1]
   Let us adore Him
   Let us adore Him
   Jesus Christ is the Lord
   Come and behold Him
   Bow down before Him
   Jesus Christ is the Lord</lyrics>
