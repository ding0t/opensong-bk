 There's a church in the valley by the wildwood,
 No lovelier spot in the dale;
 No place is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale.

[C1]
   Refrain:
   Come to the church in the wildwood,
   Oh, come to the church in the vale;
   No spot is so dear to my childhood
   As the little brown church in the vale.

[V2]
 Oh, come to the church in the wildwood,
 To the trees where the wild flowers bloom;
 Where the parting hymn will be chanted,
 We will weep by the side of the tomb.

[V3]
 How sweet on a clear Sunday morning,
 To list to the clear ringing bell;
 Its tones so sweetly are calling,
 Oh, come to the church in the vale.

[V4]
 From the church in the valley by the wildwood,
 When day fades away into might,
 I would fain from this spot of my childhood
 Wing my way to the mansions of light.</lyrics>
