 Rose up to the Father
 Noises, Thundering's, Lightnings
 Were the Response to my Worship} [x2]

 My Worship is my Weapon
 This is how I Win my Battle
 First it was Fragrance
 Then it Turned to Fire
 My Worship is my Weapon
 This is how I Win my Battle

 Rose up to the Father

 Were the Response to my Worship} [x2]
