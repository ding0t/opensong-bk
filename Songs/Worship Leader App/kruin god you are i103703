 Interlude__

[V2]
.     A
 When I was young You called my name
.   F#m
 I tried to run but stil you came
.          D
 and You stepped into the dark
.               E                        A
 'Cause that's just the kind of God You are

[V3]
.       A
 When heaven seems beyond my reach
.          F#m
 You still see eternity in me
.                D
 You're turning ashes into art
.               E                        A
 'Cause that's just the kind of God You are

[C1]
.  A                  D
   It's in the empty tomb
.                      E
   It's on the rugged cross
.                      F#m
   Your death defying love
   Is written in Your scars
.                       D
   You'll ne-ver quit on me
.                         E
   You'll always hold my heart
.                                   F#m  (D)
   'Cause that's the kind of God - You are

[V4]
.     A
 You gave me freedom from my sin
.     F#m
 You told me I could start again
.         D
 All the hurt is dead and gone
.                  E
 Now, we're Your daughters and Your sons

[V5]
.  A
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.    F#m
 We once were lost but now we're found
.             D
 Forever You hold us in Your arms
.                E                        A
 'Cause that's just the kind of God You are

[C2]
.  A                  D
   It's in the empty tomb
.                      E
   It's on the rugged cross
.                      F#m
   Your death defying love
   Is written in Your scars
.                       D
   You'll ne-ver quit on me
.                         E
   You'll always hold my heart
.                                    A
   'Cause that's the kind of God - You are

[B1]
.           D     E     F#m
   You are holy, holy, holy
.  D         E    A
   High and set apart
.           D     E     F#m
   You are holy, holy, holy
.   D         E       A
   God that's who You are .... (sing X2)

[C3]
.  A                  D

   Your death defying love
   Is written in Your scars
.                       D
   You'll ne-ver quit on me
.                         E
   You'll always hold my heart
