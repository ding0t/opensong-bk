<lyrics>[V1]
 Who gives orders to the morning
 Tells the sun where to rise
 Who speaks life into existence
 Tells the dark where to reside

[V2]
 Who chose to love the unloving
 Told the crippled to rise up
 Chose to die for my redemption
 Came to mend the broken heart

[V3]
 There is no one like our God, none like You
 You're higher, higher, higher than the heavens
 And Your love, Your love deeper than the oceans
 And Your word, Your word is true until the end
 So I'm holding onto You, the Author of life

[V4]
 Who gives orders to the morning
 Tells the sun where to rise
 Who speaks life into existence
 Tells the dark where to reside

[V5]
 Who chose to love the unloving
 Told the crippled to rise up
 Chose to die for my redemption
 Came to mend the broken heart

[V6]
 There is no one like our God, none like You
 You're higher, higher, higher than the heavens
 And Your love, Your love deeper than the oceans
 And Your word, Your word is true until the end
 So I'm holding onto You, the Author of life

[V7]
 Jesus it's You name above all names
 Worthy of all praise, the One that I know
 I'll never be able to fanthom Your ways
 And though I can't see You, my heart knows You well

[V8]
 Jesus You're higher, higher, higher than the heavens
 And Your love, Your love deeper than the oceans
 And Your word, Your word is true until the end
 So I'm holding onto You, the Author of life</lyrics>
