.      G
 Every time I tried to make it on my own
.      Bm
 Every time I tried to stand and start to fall
.              C                                 Am7
 And all those lonely roads that I have travelled on
.          G
 There was Jesus

[V2]
.         G
 When the life I built came crashing to the ground
.         Bm
 When the friends I had were nowhere to be found
.           C                           Am7
 I couldn't see it then but I can see it now
.          G    Dsus4
 There was Jesus

[C1]

   In the waiting, in the searching
.         C
   In the healing and the hurting
.          G                            D
   Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces
.        Em
   Every minute every moment
.             C
   Where I've been and where I'm going
.       G                                     Dsus4
   Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it
.  D         G
   There was Jesus

[V3]
.         G
 For this man who needs amazing kind of grace (Mmm)
.       Bm
 For forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay (Mmm)
.        C                  Am7 C     Am7
 I'm not perfect so I thank God every day
.          G                Dsus4
 There was Jesus (There was Jesus)

   On the mountain, in the valleys (There was Jesus)

   In the shadows of the alleys (There was Jesus)
