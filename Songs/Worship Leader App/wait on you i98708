 Intro

[V2]
.D
  I don't believe in fairy tales
.D
  I guess I've outgrown them
.D
  But that doesn't mean I don't believe
.D                                    G
  That there's something bigger than me
.                        Em
 Cause I've seen.. in a hospital room
 When the doctors said
.      Asus4
 &quot;Sorry there's nothing more we can do&quot;
 Well it wasn't through

[V3]
.D
  I've never seen a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
.D
  But I've got a promise I can hold
.D
  In the middle of the struggle
.G                             Em
  God if you said it You'll perform it
.                         A
 May not be how I want You to
 But here's what I'll do

   [Turnaround]

[V4]
.D
  I know You've ordered every step
.D
  Yeah, You are the Author
.D
  And there's no predicting what is next
.D
  But You hold the future
.G                               Em
  And all the questions they come second

 To the one I know is true
 You've always been true
