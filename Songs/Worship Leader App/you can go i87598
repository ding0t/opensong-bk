<title>You Can Go</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 There is a river running deep in your soul
 It's the power of God, can't you feel it flow?
 You've got a glory that can light up the dark
 You've got the Kingdom of God in your heart

[C1]
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the treasure that the world needs to know
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the power of God, let it flow

[V2]
 You've got a promise from your Father above
 There is nothing on this earth that can stop His love
 You are the light He wants to set on a hill
 You are the one who can walk in His will

[C2]
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the treasure that the world needs to know
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the power of God, let it flow

[B1]
   With the prize before and the cross behind
   In the power of God and the name that binds
   You can walk in faith, you can always know
   When the Lord puts love in your heart, it will flow

[C3]
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the treasure that the world needs to know
   You can go now, you can go
   You've got the power of God, let it flow</lyrics>
