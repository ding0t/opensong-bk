<lyrics>[V1]
 Joy of my desire, all consuming fire;
 Lord of glory, Rose of Sharon,
 Rare and sweet.
 You are now my peace,
 Comforter and friend,
 Wonderful, so beautiful,
 You are to me.

[V2]
 I worship You in spirit and in truth.
 Lord, I worship You in spirit and in truth.
 There will never be a friend as dear to me,
 There will never be a friend as dear to me,
 There will never be a friend as dear to me,
 As dear to me as You, You.

[V3]
 Joy of my desire,
 All consuming fire.</lyrics>
