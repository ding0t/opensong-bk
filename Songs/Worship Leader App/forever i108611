 Verse
.A                             A/C#
 I'll worship at your throne, whisper my own love song
.D                           F#m         E
 With all my heart I'll sing for You my Dad and King
.A                          A/C#
 I'll live for all my days, to put a smile on Your face
.D                         F#m            E
 And when we finally meet, it'll be for eternity

 And oh, how wide You open up Your arms when I need Your love
.        A            E                  G
 And how far You would come if ever I was lost
.    D/F#                E                      G
 You say that all You feel for me is undying love

 That You showed me through the cross

 I'll worship You my God, I'll worship You my God

 I love You, I love You

 Forever I will sing, forever I will be with You, be with You
