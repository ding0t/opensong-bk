<lyrics>[V1]
 Open up the doors of Heaven
 We're here to meet with You oh Lord
 In this song God we ask
 That you'd set Your gaze
 Keep the doors of Heaven opened

[V2]
 We are asking for Your presence
 Lord we are waiting for You here
 This our prayer, our desire
 As a fragrant offering
 Give us in return Your presence

[C1]
   We ask for You to come
   Lord come and dwell among us
   Receive all of the glory
   As we give You all our praise

[C2]
   The name of Jesus Christ
   The only name that saves us
   Be praised above all others
   As we lift Your name on high</lyrics>
