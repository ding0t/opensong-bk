 You take, our lives
 Flawed yet beautiful
 Restore, refine
 Lord You're merciful
 Redeem, revive
 Spirit of God
 Breathe on Your church
 Pour out Your presence
 Speak through Your word
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone
 New power, new wine
 As divisions fall
 One church, one bride
 Jesus, Lord of all
 With one voice, we cry
 Spirit of God
 Breathe on Your church
 Pour out Your presence
 Speak through Your word
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone
 Christ alone
 So God we pray to You
 Humble ourselves again
 Lord would You hear our cry?
 Lord will You heal our land?
 That every eye will see
 That every heart will know
 The One who took our sin
 The One who died and rose
 So God we pray to You
 Humble ourselves again...</lyrics>
