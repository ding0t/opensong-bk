.Em                                      D                    C   B7
 Satan goes around like a roaring lion, Seeking whom he may devour
.Em                                         D                                       C B7, Em
 But he has been defeated so I'm testifying, By the blood of Jesus he lost his pow'r
 Verse 2:
 Christ was lifted up with my sin upon him, His life and blood came flowing down
 So hear me! I'm declaring Jesus Christ is Lord, I'm taking back His Holy Ground

[V2]
 Chorus:
.Em          D Em  Em       D Em            Em          D Em    B    B7(Em) ) 2x
 I belong to Jesus, I belong to Him, I belong to Jesus, Free from sin

[V3]
 Verse 3:
 All sin nailed to the cross and the Lamb's blood flowing, meant victory was sealed that day
 When satan saw the blood he knew that Christ had won it
 And he knew that Sunday was on its way

[V4]
 Verse 4:
 The ground began to quake and all of heaven's power, came bursting from the tomb within
 The stone was rolled away and hell was overpowered, by the King who rose again

[V5]

 Christ the King of kings (Christ the King of kings)
.Em                    D   Em Em                      D   Em
 He wears the victor's crown (He wears the victor's crown)

 Satan was defeated (Satan was defeated)
