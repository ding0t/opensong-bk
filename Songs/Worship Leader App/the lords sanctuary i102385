<lyrics>[V1]
 Come let us go to His sanctuary ,
 where the saints gather to worship.
 The choir ministers in praise,
 spreading the joy of the Lord in the Holy Ghost.
 Come boldly to the throne of grace
 for great are the Lord's mercies.
 The word cleanses our hearts,
 and washes our garments clean.
 With a heart full of expectations,
 come into the house of God
.    
     for our God gives liberally ,
.    
     and truly upbraided not

[V2]
 Am glad whenever they say let us go to the house of God.
 For in the presence of God there is fullness of joy.
 At the alter of the Lord nothing is impossible.
 All u need is to lay the burden on the alter.
 Surely your desires shall be granted.

[V3]
 Come let us go to His sanctuary,
 where the saints gather to worship.
 The choir ministers in praise,
 spreading the joy of the Lord in the Holy Ghost.
 Come boldly to the throne of grace,
 for great are the Lord's mercies.
 The word cleanses our hearts
 and washes our garments clean.
 With a heart full of expectation,
 come into the house of God.
 For our God gives liberally,
 And truly upbraided not.

[V4]
 The flesh of the lamb is without blemish.
 With his precious blood He had washed away our sins.
 The temple of the Lord is a temple of glory.
 His mercies endures for ever.
 The house of the Lord is a throne of grace,
 where we obtain mercy on the time of need.
 The house of the Lord our God is a throne where prayers are answered,
 where the food of the spirit is served,
 where our needs are provided,
 where there is healing,
 where there is deliverance,
 where we possess our possessions.

[V5]
 Come let us go to his sanctuary,
 where the saints gather to worship.
 The choir ministers in praise,
 spreading the joy of the Lord in the Holy Ghost.
 Come boldly to the throne of grace,
 for great are the Lord's mercies.
 The word cleanses our hearts,
 and washes our garments clean.
 With a heart full of expectations, come into the house of God.
 For our God gives liberally,
 and truly upbraided not.</lyrics>
