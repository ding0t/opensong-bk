<lyrics>[C1]
   Speak to the storm
   Speak to the rain
   You have the power
   to bring about a change
   God Has come in you
   Now He speaks through you
   Don't cry my Brother
   Just speak in His Name

[V1]
 We are in a new season now
 you have authority
 God commands the devil
 to set your loved ones free
 The third pull is here
 it can't be imitated
 The power that's in the Bride
 Can not be duplicated

[V2]
 Satan's coming at you
 like a mighty lion's roar
 But you don't have to take
 what he's doing anymore
 Put on your fighting armor
 Be confident and sure
 There's no need to fear him
 Tell him who you're standing for

[C2]
   Speak to the storm
   Speak to the rain
   You have the power
   to bring about a change
   God Has come in you
   Now He speaks through you
   Don't cry my Brother
   Dont cry my Sister
   Just speak in His Name</lyrics>
