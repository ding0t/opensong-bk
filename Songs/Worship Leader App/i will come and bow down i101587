<lyrics>[V1]
 I will come and bow down
 At Your feet Lord Jesus
 In Your presence
 Is fullness of joy
 There is nothing, there is no one
 Who compares with You
 I take pleasure in
 Worshiping You Lord

[V2]
 Heaven is Your Throne
 And the earth is Your footstool
 Jesus I come to bow down
 At Your feet
 O how I love just
 To worship before You
 In Your presence
 My joy is complete
 I will come and bow down
 At Your feet Lord Jesus
 In Your presence
 Is fullness of joy
 There is nothing, there is no one
 Who compares with You
 I take pleasure in
 Worshiping You Lord

[V3]
 There is nothing
 There is no one
 Who compares with You
 I take pleasure in worshiping
 I take pleasure in worshiping
 I take pleasure in worshiping
 You Lord

[V4]
 There is nothing
 There is no one
 Who compares with You
 It's my pleasure to
 Love You Lord
 It's my pleasure to
 Glorify You Lord
 It's my pleasure to
 Worship You Lord</lyrics>
