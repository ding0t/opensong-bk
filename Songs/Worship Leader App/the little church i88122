<lyrics>[V1]
 If you want your dream to be
 Take your time, go slowly
 Do few things but do them well
 Heartfelt work grows purely
 If you want to live life free
 Take your time, go slowly
 Do few things but do them well
 Heartfelt work grows purely

[C1]
   Day by day, stone by stone
   Build your secret slowly
   Day by day, you'll grow too
   You'll know heaven's glory</lyrics>
