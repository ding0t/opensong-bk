<aka>My Hope</aka>
<lyrics>[V1]
 When I fall, Lord, hold out Your hand
 The waves loom large amidst the storm
 But in You, in Your word
 Lord, I put my hope
 I will trust You evermore

[V2]
 This world is nothing to me
 My portion is You
 My Jesus, my Lord
 One day I'll sit at the feast
 Opposite You, and with that hope
 I live

[V3]
 I live
 I live, I live</lyrics>
