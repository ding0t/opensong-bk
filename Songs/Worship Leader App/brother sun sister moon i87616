 Brother Sun, Sister Moon
 Brother Sun and Sister Moon
 I seldom see you seldom hear your tune
 Preoccupied with selfish misery

[V2]
 Brother Wind and Sister Air
 Open my eyes to visions pure and fair
 That I may see the glory around me.

[C1]
   I am God's creature, of Him I am part
   I feel His love awakening my heart.

[V3]
 Brother Sun and Sister Moon
 I now do see you, I can hear your tune
 So much in love with all that I survey.</lyrics>
