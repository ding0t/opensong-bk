<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><song><lyrics>[V1]
 Your eye is on the sparrow
 And your hand, it comfort me
 From the ends of the earth to the depth of my heart
 Let your mercy and strength be seen

[V2]
 You call me to your purpose
 As angels understand
 For your glory, may you draw all men
 As your love and grace demands

[V3]
 And i will run go you
 To your words of truth
 Not by might but by power
 But by the spirit of God

[V4]
 Yes, i will run the race
 'Till i see your face
 Oh, let me live in the glory of your grace</lyrics>
<title>I Will Run To You</title>
