<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus has a table spread where the saints
 of God are fed,
 He invites His chosen people &quot;Come and
 me;&quot;
 With His manna He doth feed and
 supplies our every need;
 O, 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the
 time!

[V2]
 CHORUS
 &quot;Come and dine,&quot; the Master calleth,
 &quot;Come and dine;&quot;
 You may feast at Jesus' table all the
 time;
 He who fed the multitude, turned the
 water into wine,
 To the hungry calleth now, &quot;Come and
 dine.&quot;

[V3]
 The disciples came to land, thus obeying
 Christ's command,
 For the Master called to them, &quot;Come
 and dine;&quot;
 There they found their hearts' desire,
 bread and fish upon the fire;
 Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

[V4]
 Soon the Lamb will take His bride to
 be ever at His side,
 All the host of heaven will assembled be;
 O, 'twill be a glorious sight, all the
 saints in spotless white;
 And with Jesus they will feast eternally.</lyrics>
