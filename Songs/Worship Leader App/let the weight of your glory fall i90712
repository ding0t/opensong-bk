<lyrics>[V1]
.Am                             Am
 Spirit of the sovereign Lord, come and make Your presence known.
.  F         G           Am
 Reveal the glory of the living God.

[C1]
.            F               G     Am
   Let the weight of Your glory cover us,
.           F            G     Am
   Let the life of Your river flow.
.           F            G       Am
   Let the truth of Your kingdom reign in us.
.           F               G
   Let the weight of Your glory,
.           F               G    Am
   Let the weight of Your glory fall.

[B1]
.      F       G        D
   We do not seek Your hand,
.     F       G        C
   We only seek Your face.
.  F            C
    We want to know You,
.  F            C
    We want to see You.
.     G         D             Esus E
   Reveal Your glory in this place.</lyrics>
