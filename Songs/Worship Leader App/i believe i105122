 I believe in the blood of Jesus
 That washes white as snow
 I believe in the power of a Gospel
 Still makes the broken whole
 I believe that the curse of sin was broken
 When they rolled away that stone
 I believe I believe I believe

[V2]
 Chorus

[V3]
 As I bow before You Lord
 I will rise in confidence
 I will see Your goodness Lord
 In the land I'm livin' in
 No matter where I go
 And no matter where I've been
 I will see your goodness Lord
 In the land I'm livin' in

[V4]
 Verse 2

[V5]

 When we fall down on our knees
 I believe that the lame will go walking
 And the blind are gonna see
 I believe that the gates of hell tremble
 When the church begins to sing
 I believe I believe I believe
