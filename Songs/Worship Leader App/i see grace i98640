<lyrics>[V1]
.B         F#                 C#m7
 Jesus my help, I call on Your name
.   E               B
 I cast my cares on You
.         F#                 C#m7
 Jesus my hope, my tower of strength
.     E              G#m7
 My faith is found in You

[P1]
.             F#/A#              G#m7
   I see You pierced, wounded for me
.         E                  F#
   When I look to the cross I see

[C1]
.         B                        F#
   I see grace, sealed by Your sacrifice
.        G#m7              E
   I see love, reaching for me
.            B                     F#
   Precious blood, washes and sanctifies
.          G#m7              E
   Healing flows, setting me free
.         B ( &lt;F# C#m7 E )
   I see grace

[V2]
.B         F#                 C#m7
 Bearer of sin, afflicted and tried
.     E                 B
 You paid redemption's price
.            F#                    C#m7
 Bearing my curse, You've set me on high
.     E                   G#m7
 Your death has brought me life</lyrics>
