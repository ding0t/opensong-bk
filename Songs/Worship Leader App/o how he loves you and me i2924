<lyrics>[C1]
   Oh, how He loves you and me
   Oh, how He loves you and me
   He gave his life
   What more could He give
   Oh, how He loves you
   Oh, how He loves me
   Oh, how He loves you and me

[V1]
 Jesus to Calvary did go,
 His love for sinners to show.
 What He did there
 brought hope from despair.
 Oh, how He loves you;
 Oh, how He loves me;
 Oh, how He loves you and me.

[C2]
   Oh, how He loves you and me,
   Oh how He loves you and me.
   He gave his life, what
   more could He give?
   Oh, how He loves you;
   Oh, how He loves me;
   Oh, how He loves you and me.</lyrics>
