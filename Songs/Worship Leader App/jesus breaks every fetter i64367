<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus breaks every fetter,
 Jesus breaks every fetter,
 Jesus breaks every fetter,
 And He sets me free.

[V2]
 I am now on the altar,
 I am now on the altar,
 I am now on the altar
 Which was made for me.

[V3]
 I will never doubt my Savior,
 I will never doubt my Savior,
 I will never doubt my Savior,
 For He cleanses me.

[V4]
 I will rest on His promise,
 I will rest on His promise,
 I will rest on His promise,
 Which is given to me.

[V5]
 I will shout Hallelujah!
 I will shout Hallelujah!
 I will shout Hallelujah!
 For He sets me free.</lyrics>
