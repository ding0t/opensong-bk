<lyrics>[V1]
 &quot;Are ye able,&quot; said the Master,
 &quot;To be crucified with me?&quot;
 &quot;Yea,&quot; the sturdy dreamers answered,
 &quot;To the death we follow Thee.&quot;

[C1]
   Lord, we are able.
   Our spirits are Thine.
   Remold them, make us,
   Like Thee, divine.
   Thy guiding radiance
   Above us shall be
   A beacon to God,
   To love, and loyalty.

[V2]
 Are ye able to remember,
 When a thief lifts up his eyes,
 That his pardoned soul is worthy
 Of a place in paradise?

[V3]
 Are ye able when the shadows
 Close around you with the sod,
 To believe that spirit triumphs,
 To commend your soul to God?

[V4]
 &quot;Are ye able?&quot; Still the Master
 Whispers down eternity,
 And heroic spirits answer
 Now, as then, in Galilee.</lyrics>
