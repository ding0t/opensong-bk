<title>Faith of a Mustard Seed</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Just a little faith
 of a mustard seed, my friend
 this is what My Lord has said

[V2]
 Just say the words
 to the mountain:
 Move away! Move away!
 Just speak the words
 to the mountain:
 Move away! Move away!

[C1]
   And the mountains will be removed</lyrics>
