.A                        D              A/C#
 A thousand generations falling down in worship
.   F#m               E           D
 To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
.     A                             D              A
 And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
.     F#m               E           A
 Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

   All thrones and dominions

   You are lifted high, Holy

   Holy forever

[V2]
.A                           D                 A/C#
 If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
.F#m               E           D
 Sing the song forever to the Lamb
. A                          D               A
 If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name

 Sing the song forever to the Lamb

 We'll sing the song forever and amen
