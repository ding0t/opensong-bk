<title>Resurrection Power</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 There's a feeling in the air that God is everywhere
 And His resurrection power is moving in this hour
 That Jesus might be glorified

[V2]
 There's a feeling in the air that God is everywhere
 And His resurrection power is moving in this hour
 That Jesus might be glorified

[V3]
 I will glorify the name of the Lord
 I will glorify His name
 And His resurrection power is moving in this hour
 That Jesus might be glorified</lyrics>
