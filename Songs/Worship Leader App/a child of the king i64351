 My Father is rich in
 houses and lands,
 He holdeth the wealth of
 the world in His hands!
 Of rubies and diamonds,
 of silver and gold
 His coffers are full,
 He has riches untold.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   I'm a child of the King!
   A child of the King!
   With Jesus my Saviour,
   I'm a child of the King!

[V2]
 My Father's own Son,
 the Saviour of men,
 Once wandered o'er earth
 as the poorest of them;
 But now He is reigning
 forever on high,
 And will give me a home
 in heav'n by and by.

[V3]
 I once was an outcast,
 stranger on earth,
 A sinner by choice,
 and an alien by birth!
 But I've been adopted,
 my name's written down,
 An heir to a mansion,
 a robe, and a crown.

[V4]
 A tent or a cottage,
 why should I care?
 They're building a palace
 for me over there!
 Though exiled from home,
 yet still I may sing:
 All glory to God,
 I'm a child of the King!</lyrics>
