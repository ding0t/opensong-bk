<lyrics>[C1]
   God is good all the time
   He put a song of praise
   In this heart of mine
   God is good all the time
   Through the darkest night
   His light will shine
   God is good
   God is good all the time

[V1]
 If you're walking through the valley
 and there are shadows all around
 Do not fear He will guide you
 He will keep you safe and sound
 He has promised to never leave you
 Nor forsake you
 And His Word is true

[V2]
 We were sinners so unworthy
 Still for us He chose to die
 He filled us with His Holy Spirit
 Now we can stand and testify
 That His love is everlasting
 And His mercies
 they will never end

[B1]
   Though I may not understand
   All the plans You have for me
   My life is in Your hands
   And through the eyes of faith
   I can clearly see</lyrics>
