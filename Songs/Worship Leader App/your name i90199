<lyrics>[V1]
 As morning dawns and evenings fades,
 You inspire songs of praise
 That rise from earth to touch Your heart and glorify Your Name

[V2]
 Your Name is a strong and mighty tower
 Your Name is a shelter like no other
 Your Name, let the nations sing it louder
 'Cause nothing has the power to save
 But Your Name

[V3]
 Jesus, in Your Name we pray
 Come and fill our hearts today
 Lord, give us strength to live for You and glorify Your Name

[V4]
 Your Name is a strong and mighty tower
 Your Name is a shelter like no other
 Your Name, let the nations sing it louder
 'Cause nothing has the power to save
 But Your name</lyrics>
