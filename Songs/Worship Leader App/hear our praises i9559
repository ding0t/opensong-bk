<title>Hear our Praises</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 May our homes be filled with dancing
 May our streets be filled with joy
 May injustice bow to Jesus
 As the people turn to pray

[C1]
   From the mountains to the valleys
   Hear our praises rise to You
   From the heavens to the nations
   Hear our singing fill the air

[V2]
 May Your light shine in the darkness
 As we walk before the cross
 May Your glory fill the whole earth
 As the water o'er seas

[B1]
   Hallelujah, hallelujah
   Hallelujah, hallelujah
   Hallelujah, hallelujah
   Hallelujah, hallelujah</lyrics>
