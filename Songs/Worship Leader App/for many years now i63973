<lyrics>[V1]
 For many years now
 Satan has tried to stop us,
 but the Bride of Jesus,
 yes, She's still alive.
 Like a mighty army,
 She keeps pressing onward.
 Winning every battle,
 for the Lord's on Her side.

[C1]
   Chorus:
   We've got the power
   in the Name of Jesus,
   we've got the power
   in the Name of the Lord.
   Though Satan rages,
   we shall not be defeated.
   We've got the power
   in the Name of the Lord.

[V2]
 Give me your hand,
 let us agree together.
 Then let all of our enemies
 stumble at our feet.
 For whatever we bind on earth,
 shall be bound in heaven,
 at the Name of Jesus,
 demons have to flee.</lyrics>
