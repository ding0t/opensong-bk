<title>As David Did</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 As David did in Jehovah's sight,
 I will dance will all my might
 Before the King of Kings
 As Miriam did with the tambourine,
 I will clap my hands and sing
 before the King of Kings.
 As Judah did on the battle ground,
 we will make a joyful sound
 before the King of Kings.
 As Joshua did at Jericho,
 we will shout to defeat the foe
 before the King of Kings

[V2]
 We can come before Him,
 and worship Him today!
 We can now adore Him,
 Yeshua, You made the way!</lyrics>
