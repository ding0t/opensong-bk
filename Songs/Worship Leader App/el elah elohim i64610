<lyrics>[C1]
   El Elah Elohim
   How we long to worship You.
   El Elah Elohim
   How we long to worship You.

[V1]
 Lord we come to You in worship
 No matter what the circumstance.
 No matter what the situation
 We will lift up holy hands.

[V2]
 Here we are in Satan's Eden
 Satan comes to beat us down
 But with your Spirit here before us
 In righteousness, we'll arise and save</lyrics>
