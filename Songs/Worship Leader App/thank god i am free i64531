<lyrics>[V1]
 Thank God I am free, free, free
 From this world of sin.
 I've been washed in the blood of Jesus,
 I've been born again.
 Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
 By His wonderful grace.
 I'm so glad that I found out
 He could bring me out
 And show me the way.

[V2]
 For a long time I travelled
 Down a long lonely road;
 My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
 Then I heard about Jesus,
 What a wonderful hour;
 I'm so glad that I found out
 He could bring me out
 Through His saving power.

[V3]
 Thank God I am free, free, free
 From this world of sin.
 I've been washed in the blood of Jesus,
 I've been born again.
 Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
 By His wonderful grace.
 I'm so glad that I found out
 He could bring me out
 And show me the way.

[V4]
 Like a bird out of prison
 That has taken its flight;
 Like a blind man that God
 Gave back his sight.
 Like a poor wretched beggar
 That's found fortune and fame,
 I'm so glad that I found out
 He could bring me out
 Thro' His holy name.</lyrics>
