.    C                  F
   Great and mighty is He,
.    Bb                 C
   Great and mighty is He;
.                      F
   Clothed in glory arrayed in splendour,
.    Bb                 C
   Great and mighty is He.

[V1]
. Bb      F        C
 Let us lift His name up high,
.    Bb     F    C
 Celebrate His grace;
. Bb     F      C
 For He has redeemed our lives,
.         Bb        G
 And He reigns on high.</lyrics>
