<lyrics>[V1]
 You've turned it all around
 Where I was hurting now I'm rejoicing
 In Your love I'm found and I have joy
 Woah

[V2]
 You took away my pain
 You turned my mourning into dancing
 I can smile again 'cause I have joy
 Woah

[P1]
   Let the celebration begin
   Make a joyful noise unto Him
   Come on everybody
   Let's give Him praise for He is good

[C1]
   You have given me a joy that ...
   won't stop and will never leave, so
   I will praise You with gladness
   For You are good

[B1]
   You've turned my sadness into gladness
   You've turned my sorrow into joy
   Now I'm singing and I'm dancing
   And I will shout for joy</lyrics>
