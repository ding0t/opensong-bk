<lyrics>[V1]
 There's a story in the Bible of Elisha,
 a Shunammite woman and her son.
 The woman found favour with God
 and He gave her a son.
 While working in the field
 the little boy died.
 But the woman's faith never failed,
 even in death she testified
 that - All is well! -

[C1]
   CHORUS
   All is well, all is well.
   I have heard the message &quot;Shalom&quot;
   and all is well.
   There is a place of perfect rest
   inside the inner veil.
   So rest, little Bride, rest,
   for all is well.

[V2]
 Now things have not worked out
 like God's people thought.
 For we're still here, to fight the
 greatest battle ever fought.
 We must have the faith of Abraham,
 knowing God's Word never fails.
 If you trust in Him you will find
 that - All is well! -</lyrics>
