 O how much the Lord has blessed you!
 Blessed you with unlimited love.
 // When His children come in worship
 Father offers us His embrace. //

[V2]
 God has shed His grace upon you,
 Gifted you life everlasting.
 // And His promise is that through you
 His salvation will reach others. //

[V3]
 From Isa's word let us draw strength.
 &quot;If times look rough, know I'll be there.&quot;
 // Matters not just where you are,
 My presence will accompany you. //</lyrics>
