<lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is my firm foundation
 The rock on which I stand
 When everything around me is shaken
 I've never been more glad
 That I put my faith it Jesus
 'Cause He's never let me down
 He's faithful through generations
 So why would He fail now?
 He won't
 I've still got joy in chaos
 I've got peace that makes no sense
 And I won't be going under
 I'm not held by my own strength
 'Cause I built my life on Jesus
 He's never let me down
 He's faithful in every season
 So why would He fail now?
 He won't
 He won't
 He won't fail
 He won't fail
 Christ is my firm foundation
 The rock on which I stand
 When everything around me is shaken
 I've never been more glad
 That I put my faith it Jesus
 He's never let me down
 He's faithful through generations
 So why would He fail now?
 He won't
 He won't
 He won't fail
 He won't fail
 He's not gonna fail
 He's not gonna fail
 He's not gonna fail
 He's never failed me, He's never failed me
 He's not gonna fail
 He's not gonna fail
 He's gonna make a way
 Wande, what you gotta say?
 Okay, okay
 'Member them days in the five-one-two, no clue I'd make it to peach street
 Spirit on low had foes tryna take me out
 Tryna dim my belief
 Yeah, tryna dim my light
 Tryna dim my shine
 Don't you know I'm blessed?
 Don't you know I'm lit?
 Don't you know I'm chose?
 Don't you know I'm fine?
 Hol' up
 Aye, I built my house on the rock
 Tell me then why would I stop?
 Why would I stress off a opp?
 My God on top
 Cover me, enemy under me
 Living righteous so no wonder He coming through
 Saw them fall at my side, I'm still on my 2
 Had to go through the pain, had me feeling blue
 Had me praying like &quot;Lord help me make it through&quot;
 Yeah, But I put my faith up in Jesus
 Holy Ghost, He never leaves us
 Enemy trying to deceive us
 Where the believers?
 If you need hope just receive this
 Any weather, any storm He gon' never leave
 You gon' make it through, prayers up intercede
 He gon' give you that grace and that's guaranteed
 You ain't born again
 Call on Him, just believe
 He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 I know He's gonna make a way
 'Cause rain came, wind blew
 But my house was built on You
 I'm safe with You
 I'm gonna make it
 I'm gonna make it through
 Rain came, wind blew
 My house was built on You
 (Come on, come on, come on)
 I'm safe with You
 (I'm gonna)
 I'm gonna (I'm gonna) make it (I'm gonna)
 I'm gonna make it
 Rain came, wind blew
 (Come on)
 My house was built on You
 (Sing it out, sing it out, say-)
 I'm safe (with You) with You (I'm gonna)
 I'm gonna make it (Rain came)
 Rain came, wind blew
 My house was built on You
 I'm safe with You
 I'm gonna make it (yes I'm gonna make it)
 I'm gonna make it (I'm gonna make it)
 I'm gonna make it (I'm gonna make it)
 Yes, I'm gonna make it (I'm gonna make it)
 I'm gonna make it (I'm gonna make it)
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 I know, I know
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way (He's gonna come through, He's gonna come through)
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way (He's gonna come through, He's gonna come through)
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He ain't gon' fail, He ain't gon' fail
 (Even when it looks like there ain't no way)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (And the darkness sits around me)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (I have faith in my Lord God He-)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (Leaning, leaning on Jesus)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (I'm leaning, I'm leaning on Jesus)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (Just to take Him at His word)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (Oh just to rest on His promise)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (If He said it, He will do it I know-)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (Just to rest in on His promise)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (If He said it, He will do it)
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way
 (He's gonna make a way, He's gonna make a way)
 Christ is my firm foundation
 The rock on which I stand
 When everything around me is shaken
 I've never been more glad
 That I put my faith it Jesus
 'Cause He's never let me down
 He's faithful through generations
 So why would He fail now?
 He won't
 I've still got joy in chaos
 I've got peace that makes no sense
 And I won't be going under
 I'm not held by my own strength
 'Cause I built my life on Jesus
 He's never let me down
 He's faithful in every season
 So why would He fail now?
 He won't
 He won't
 He won't fail
 He won't fail</lyrics>
