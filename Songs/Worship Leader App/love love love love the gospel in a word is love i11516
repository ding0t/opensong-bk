<lyrics>[V1]
 Love, love, love, love,
 the gospel in a word is love,
 Love thy neighbor as thy brother,
 love, love, love.

[V2]
 Peace, peace, peace, peace,
 the gospel in a word is peace,
 Peace that passes understanding,
 peace, peace, peace.

[V3]
 Joy, joy, joy, joy,
 the gospel in a word is joy,
 Joy that fills to overflowing,
 joy, joy, joy.

[V4]
 Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ,
 the gospel in a word is Christ,
 Love Him, serve Him, and adore Him,
 Christ, Christ, Christ.</lyrics>
