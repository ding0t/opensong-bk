 There is a light
 It burns brighter than the sun
 He steals the night
 And casts no shadow
 There is hope
 Should oceans rise and mountains fall
 He never fails

[C1]
   So take heart
   Let His love lead us through the night
   Hold on to hope
   And take courage again

[V2]
 In death by love
 The fallen world was overcome
 He wears the scars of our freedom
 In His Name
 All our fears are swept away
 He never fails

[P1]
   All the world and its troubles
   Take heart for He has overcome
   All the world and its troubles
   Take heart for God has overcome
   All the world and its troubles
   Take heart for He has overcome
   All the world and its troubles
   Take heart our God has overcome

[B1]
   All our troubles and all our tears
   God our hope He has overcome
   All our failure and all our fear
   God our love He has overcome

[B2]
   All our heartache and all our pain
   God our healer He has overcome
   All our burdens and all our shame
   God our freedom He has overcome

[B3]
   God our justice God our grace
   God our freedom He has overcome
   God our refuge God our strength
   God is with us He has overcome</lyrics>
