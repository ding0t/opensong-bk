<lyrics>[V1]
 Well, I'm tired and so weary,
 But I must go along;
 Till the Lord comes and calls
 Me away, oh, yes;
 Well the morning is bright
 And the Lamb is the Light;
 And the night, night is as fair
 As the day, oh yes.

[C1]
   CHORUS
   There will be peace in the valley
   For me some day;
   There will be peace in the valley
   For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
   There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
   no trouble I'll see;
   There will be peace
   In the valley for me.

[V2]
 There the flow'rs will be blooming,
 And the grass will be green;
 And the skies will be clear
 And serene, oh, yes;
 Well the sun ever beams,
 In this valley of dreams;
 And no clouds there will ever
 Be seen,oh, yes.

[V3]
 Well, the bear will be gentle,
 And the wolf will be tame;
 And the lion shall lay down
 By the lamb, oh, yes;
 Well the beast from the wild,
 Shall be led by a little child;
 And I'll be changed, changed
 From this creature that I am, oh, yes.</lyrics>
