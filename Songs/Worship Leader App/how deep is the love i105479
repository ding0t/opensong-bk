<lyrics>[V1]
 The deepest of seas and furthest horizons
 Can't even begin to speak of Your kindness
 While I ran so far in rebellion
 Still You gave Your life without question

[P1]
   Before I even said I'm sorry
   You made a way for me

[C1]
   How deep is the love
   How high is the One who
   Forgives and forgets all our sin
   How great is Your grace
   I'll never forget all You've done
   Oh how deep is Your love

[V2]
 The darkest of days slip right out of focus
 No valley out dives Your depths of devotion
 You lay me down in green pastures
 So I'll rest beside Your still waters

[P2]
   I've never known a grace so thoughtful
   You always make a way</lyrics>
