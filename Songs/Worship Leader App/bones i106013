 In the gold of morn
 When the air is cold
 I feel you walking through
 You cast out all my scorn
 You have all my cares
 I give them all to you

[V2]
 Let me see like you
 Let me see like you
 God give me your eyes
 Help my love to be true

[V3]
 I can feel it in my bones
 Jesus pull me close
 Bend me and rid me of my idols
 See the Lightning in your hands
 The thunder as it rolls
 I can feel you taking hold of my soul (My soul)

[V4]
 In the quiet of night
 When the light is dim
 Shine in my eyes
 Make me more like Him
 You have all my fears
 All my hopes and prayers
 Keep your joy in me

[V5]
 Let me see like you
 Let me see like you
 God give me your eyes
 Help my love to be true

[V6]
 I can feel it in my bones
 Jesus pull me close
 Bend me and rid me of my idols
 See the Lightning in your hands
 The thunder as it rolls
 I can feel you taking hold of my soul (My soul)

[V7]
 Make me new I surrender
 Make me new I surrender
 Make me new I surrender
 Make me new I surrender

[V8]
 I can feel it in my bones
 Jesus pull me close
 Bend me and rid me of my idols
 See the Lightning in your hands
 The thunder as it rolls
 I can feel you taking hold of my soul

[V9]
 I can feel it in my bones
 Jesus pull me close
 Bend me and rid me of my idols
 See the Lightning in your hands
 The thunder as it rolls
 I can feel you taking hold of my soul</lyrics>
