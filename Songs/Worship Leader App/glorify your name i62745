<lyrics>[V1]
 King of Glory I surrender,
 King of Heaven my voice I lift to You.
 Let my worship be pleasing unto You.

[V2]
 My desire is to worship,
 all I long for is to touch your heart.
 Let my worship be pleasing unto you.

[P1]
   /// There is no one else like You ///
   O Lord!

[C1]
   // King of Kings,
   Lord of all Lords
   I exalt Your Name on high
   as I draw closer
   to Your Great Throne
   Glorify Your Name //</lyrics>
