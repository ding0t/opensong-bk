<lyrics>[V1]
 Mountain maker, ocean tamer,
 Glimpses of You burn in my eyes;
 The worship of heaven
 Fills up the skies.

[C1]
   You made it all,
   Said let there be,
   And there was all that we see.
   The sounds of Your voice,
   The works of Your hands,
   You do all things well.
   You do all things well.
   You do all things well.

[V2]
 Star creator, wind breather,
 The strokes of Your beauty,
 Brushed through the clouds;
 Light from the heavens,
 Touching the ground.

[B1]
   Imagination runs wild
   And breathes the breath of life
   Across the fields, across the miles...</lyrics>
