.         C
 Blessed Assurance
.         Am
 Jesus is mine
.              F
 He's been my fourth man in the fire
.C/E        Dm
 Time after time
.             C
 Born of His spirit
.              Am
 Washed in His blood
.             F
 And what He did for me on Calvary
.C/E           Dm
 Is more than enough

[C1]
.              C
   I trust in God
   My Savior
.       Am                 F
   The One who will never fail
.                Dm  F
   He will never fail

[V2]
.         C
 Perfect Submission
.          Am
 All is at rest
.           F
 I know the Author of tomorrow
.      C/E        Dm
 Has ordered my steps
.               C
 So this is my story
.                Am
 And this is my song
.             F
 Praising my risen King and Savior
.C/E          Dm F
 All the day long

[B1]
.  C
   I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
.  Am
   I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
.  F
   I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
.  Dm
   That's why I trust Him
.  F
   That's why I trust Him</lyrics>
