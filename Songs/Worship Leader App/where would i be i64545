<lyrics>[V1]
 Where would I be You only know
 I'm Glad You see through eyes of love
 A hopeless case, an empty place
 If not for Grace x2

[C1]
   Amazing grace how sweet the sound
   I once was lost but now I'm found
   A hopeless case, an empty place
   If not for Grace

[V2]
 Precious Lord please take my hand
 Lead me on let me stand
 A hopeless case, an empty place
 If not for Grace</lyrics>
