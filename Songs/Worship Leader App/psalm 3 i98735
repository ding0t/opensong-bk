 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me,
 many are they that rise up against me.
 Many there be which say of my soul:
 there is no help for Him in God

[C1]
   But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me;
   my glory and the lifter of mi head

[V2]
 I cried unto the Lord with my voice,
 and He heard me out of His holy hill.
 I laid me down and slept;
 I awaked; for the Lord sustained me

[V3]
 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
 that have set themselves against me round about.
 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
 that have set themselves against me round about</lyrics>
