<lyrics>[V1]
 Look at the sky:
 I draw clouds for you.
 Look at the sky and say
 You see My dreams.

[V2]
 You know, it's simple and easy
 Heaven is created by God.
 Everyone can draw his dream in Heaven and fly with it.

[V3]
 Chorus:
 I did not know how to soar so high.
 I didn't want to dream so boldly.
 &quot;Break into my fate, - I prayed to You, -
 And give me wings, I want to change everything! &quot;

[V4]
 2. Love overflowed the heart.
 I do not remember sadness and pain.
 I feel the breath of paradise
 When my soul is with You!

[V5]
 Chorus
 I did not know how to soar so high.
 I didn't want to dream so boldly.
 &quot;Break into my fate, - I prayed to you, -
 And give me wings, I want to change everything! &quot;</lyrics>
