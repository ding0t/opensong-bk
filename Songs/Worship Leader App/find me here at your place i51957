<lyrics>[V1]
 Find me here at Your place
 I am forever Yours, Jesus
 At Your Name I bow to my knees
 I am forever Yours, Jesus

[C1]
   As lions we are brave because
   of Your great sthrenth You gave to us
   You find us here and gave us life
   And, Jesus, forever we cry out

[V2]
 Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord

[V3]
 Lord of all You give me peace
 I am forever Yours, Jesus
 You hold me in Your wings
 I am forever Yours, Jesus

[B1]
   Come, Jesus, come
   Fill our hearts with Your Spirit
   Come, Jesus, come
   Let Your Love be with us</lyrics>
