<lyrics>[V1]
 The circuit rider preacher
 went riding through the land,
 With a rifle on his shoulder
 and a Bible in his hand;
 He told the prairie people
 of a blessed promised land,
 As he went riding, singing along.

[C1]
   Leaning, leaning,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.
   Leaning, leaning,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[V2]
 He preached the coming judgment
 of fire and brimstone;
 And a glorious, endless heaven
 of the justified alone.
 As he rode across the mountains
 you could hear him sing this song,
 As he went riding on.

[C2]
   There is power, power,
   wonder-working power,
   In the blood of the Lamb;
   There is power, power,
   oh, wonder-working power,
   In the precious blood of the Lamb.

[V3]
 Now his rifle's old and rusty
 and is hanging on the wall;
 His Bible's very worn and dusty
 and is seldom touched at all;
 But the message that It brings us
 will meet us on that day,
 For God's Truth's still marching on.

[C3]
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
   His Truth is marching on.</lyrics>
