 1 On Cal'vry's hill of sorrow
 Where sin's demands were paid,
 And rays of hope for tomorrow
 Across our path were laid.

[C1]
   I see a crimson stream of blood,
   It flows from Calvary,
   Its waves which reach the throne of God,
   Are sweeping over me.

[V2]
 2 Today no condemnation
 Abides to turn away
 My soul from His salvation,
 He's in my heart to stay.

[V3]
 3 When gloom and sadness whisper
 You've sinned, no use to pray,
 I look away to Jesus,
 And He tells me to say:

[V4]
 4 And when we reach the portal
 Where life forever reigns,
 The ransomed hosts grand final,
 Will be this glad refrain.</lyrics>
