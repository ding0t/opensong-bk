 Thank you for the cross, Lord
 Thank you for the price You paid
 Bearing all my sin and shame
 In love You came
 And gave amazing grace

[V2]
 Thank you for this love, Lord
 Thank you for the nail pierced hands
 Washed me in Your cleansing flow
 Now all I know
 Your forgiveness and embrace

[V3]
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Seated on the throne
 Crown You now with many crowns
 You reign victorious
 High and lifted up
 Jesus Son of God
 The Darling of Heaven crucified
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb

[V4]
 Thank you for the cross, Lord (thank you)
 Thank you for the price You paid
 Bearing all my sin and shame
 In love You came
 And gave amazing grace

[V5]
 Thank you for this love, Lord
 Thank you for the nail pierced hands
 Washed me in Your cleansing flow
 Now all I know
 Your forgiveness and embrace

[V6]
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Seated on the throne
 Crown You now with many crowns
 You reign victorious
 High and lifted up
 Jesus Son of God
 The Darling of Heaven crucified
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb

[V7]
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Seated on the throne
 Crown You now with many crowns
 You reign victorious

[V8]
 High and lifted up
 Jesus Son of God
 The Darling of Heaven crucified
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Worthy is the Lamb</lyrics>
