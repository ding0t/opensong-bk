 I give unto you,
 That you love one another
 As I have loved you,
 That you love one another
 As I have loved you.
 By this shall all men know
 That you are My disciples,
 If you have love one for another.
 By this shall all men know
 That you are My disciples,
 If you have love one for another.</lyrics>
