 I was made to praise You,
 I was made to glorify Your Name,
 In every circumstance
 To find a chance to thank You.
 I was made to love You.
 I was made to worship at Your feet,
 And I'll obey You Lord.
 I was made for You.

[V2]
 I will always praise You.
 I will always glorify Your name.
 In every circumstance,
 To find a chance to thank You.
 I will always love You,
 I will always worship at Your feet,
 And I'll obey You Lord.
 I was made for You</lyrics>
