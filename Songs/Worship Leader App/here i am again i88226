<lyrics>[V1]
 Here I am again just looking
 For the words that help me say that
 My heart is full of love and praises
 I must have prayed a thousand prayers
 And sung a hundred songs but
 I just have to say again

[C1]
   Oh how I love You
   More than words can say,
   In the deepest heartfelt way
   Oh how, Lord I love You
   Once again receive my praise

[V2]
 So many words, so many songs,
 So many melodies yet
 Allow me one more declaration
 You are the lover of my soul
 The center of my life
 So I just have to say again

[B1]
   Thank You for a brand new day,
   A brand new chance to stand and say I love You
   Help me find the words to say that
   Tell You in a brand new way, I love You</lyrics>
