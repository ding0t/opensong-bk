<title>Bless the Broken Road</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.G     C        D      Em  C    D      G
 I set out on a narrow way many years ago
.G      C        D        Em     C        D       G
 Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
.    C            D
 But I got lost a time or two
.    G                   Em
 Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
.G          C       D     Em   C       D            G
 I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[V2]
 CHORUS
.G      C         G                 D        Em
  Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
.G           C        G                     D        Em
  Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
.G            C      G             D     Em
  Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
.            C                D
 This much I know (I know) is true
.           C           D    Em
 That God blessed the broken road
.     C         D         G
 That led me straight to you

[V3]
 VERSE2
.  G       C        D       Em  C      D        G
 I think about the years I spent just passing through
.     G       C        D      Em C             D       G
 I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
.     C                  D
 But you just smile and take my hand
.G                      Em
 You've been there you understand
.G         C         D        G   C       D      Em
 It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[V4]
