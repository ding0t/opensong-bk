<lyrics>[C1]
.    A            E  B/D#
   I give myself away
.   (G#m)         C#m
   I give myself away
.     B       A
   So You can use me
.    A            E  B/D#
   I give myself away
.   (G#m)         C#m
   I give myself away
.     B       A
   So You can use me

[V1]
.       E          B
 Here I am, here I stand
.         F#m             B
 Lord, my life is in Your hands
.          E          B
 Lord, I'm longing to see
.       F#m               B
 Your desires revealed in me

[V2]
 Take my heart, take my life
 as a living sacrifice
 All my dreams all my plans
 Lord I place them in Your hands

[B1]
   Bridge:
.     E
   My life is not my own
.     B
   To You I belong
.    C#m            B              A
   I give myself, I give myself to You

[B2]
   Here I am to worship
   Here I am to bow down
   Here I am to say that You're my God
   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
   Altogether wonderful to me</lyrics>
