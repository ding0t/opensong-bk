 Break every chain

[V2]
.C#m    A        E      B
 All sufficient sacrifice
.   C#m    A
 So freely given
.E      B
 such a price
.       C#m   A
 bought our redemption
.E        B           A E B
 Heaven's gates swing wide

[V3]

 There's an army rising up
 There's an army rising up
 There's an army rising up
.               C#m                A
 To break every chain, break every chain
.            E  B
 Break every chain</lyrics>
