<lyrics>[V1]
 You are forever in my life
 You see me through the seasons
 Cover me with Your hand
 And lead me in Your righteousness
 And I look to You
 And I wait on You

[C1]
   I'll sing to You Lord
   A hymn of love
   For Your faithfulness to me
   I'm carried in everlasting arms
   You'll never let me go
   Through it all
   [B]
   Hallelujah
   Hallelujah
   Hallelujah
   Hallelujah</lyrics>
