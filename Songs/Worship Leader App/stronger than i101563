.D   Em   C
 Oh Lord You have shown Your favor
.D         Em         C
 Your every word stands true
.D   Em  C
 I'm found safe within in Your harbor
.D        Em    C
 Anchored deep in You
.    Am             G/B
 You washed away my tears
.C
 Gave me joy and freedom
.Am          G/B         C
 Lifting me through the years

[C1]
.                G       Am
   Your love is stronger than
.      C                 D
   The sound of heaven's praises
.  G       C
   Higher than
.      Am              D
   The lofty mountain peaks
.  G       Am
   Deeper than
.        C            D
   The deepest ocean valleys
.  Am      G/B       C
   Strong enough for me</lyrics>
