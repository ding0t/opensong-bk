  <lyrics>[v1]
 Come, they told me, pa-rum pum pum pum
 Our new-born King to see, pa-rum pum pum pum
 Our finest gifts to bring, pa-rum pum pum pum
 To lay before the King, pa-rum pum pum pum
---
 Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
 So to honour Him, pa-rum pum pum pum
 When we come.

[v2]
 Baby Jesus, pa-rum pum pum pum
 I am a poor boy too, pa-rum pum pum pum
 I have no gift to bring, pa-rum pum pum pum
 That's fit to give a king, pa-rum pum pum pum
---
 Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
 Shall I play for you, pa-rum pum pum pum
 Oh my drum?

[v3]
 Mary Nodded, pa-rum pum pum pum
 The ox and lamb kept time, pa-rum pum pum pum
 I played my drum for him, pa-rum pum pum pum
 I played my best for him, pa-rum pum pum pum
---
 Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
 Then he smiled at me, pa-rum pum pum pum
 Me and my drum.</lyrics></song>
