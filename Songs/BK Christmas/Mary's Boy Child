  <lyrics>[V1]
 Long time ago in Bethlehem.
 So the Holy Bible say;
 Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,
 Was born on Christmas Day.
 
[c]
 Hark, now hear the angels sing,
 A new King born today,
 And Man will live for ever more,
 Beacause of Christmas Day.
 Trumpets sound and angels sing,
 Listen to what they say,
 That Man will live fore ever more,
 Because of Christmas Day.
 
[v2]
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
 Them see a bright new shining star,
 Them hear a choir singing,
 The music seemed to come from afar.
 
 (v3)
 Now Joseph and his wife Mary
 Went to Bethlehem that night
 They found no place to born the child
 Not a single room was in sight
 
 (v4)
 By and by they found a little nook
 In a stable all forlorn
 And in a manger cold and dark
 Marys little boy was born
