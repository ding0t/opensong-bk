  <lyrics>[v1]
 Sun gleams bright, Hearts are light
 Merry, merry Christmas.
 Bells ring out, Children shout,
 Merry, merry, merry Christmas
 Sheep in fold, shine like gold
 As the day is dawning
 Riding by stockmen cry,
 Welcome Christmas morning

[v2]
 Golden day, when we say,
 Merry, merry Christmas
 In the street, where we meet
 Merry, merry, merry Chrsitmas
 And with pride, far and wide
 All our homes adorning
 Earth and sky, sound the cry
 "Welcome Christmas morning"

[v3]
 So with joy, Man and boy,
 Sing with us together;
 On this morning, Christ was born,
 Merry, merry, merry Christmas.
 Raise the song, loud and strong
 In the shining weather, Joy bells ring
 Christ is King. Merry, merry, merry Christmas.</lyrics></song>
