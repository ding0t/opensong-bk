  <lyrics>[v1]
 You better watch out, you better not cry,
 Better not pout, I'm telling you why:
 Santa Claus is coming to town.

[v2]
 He's making a list, and checking it twice,
 Gonna find out who's naughty and nice:
 Santa Claus is coming to town.

[v3]
 He sees you when you're sleeping,
 He knows when you're awake,
 He knows if you've been bad or good,
 So be good for goodness sake.

[v4]
 Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry,
 Better not pout, I'm telling you why:
 Santa Claus is coming to town.</lyrics></song>
