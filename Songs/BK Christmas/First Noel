  <lyrics>[v1]
 The first Noel, the Angel did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 In fields as they lay keeping their sheep
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[c]
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
 Born is the King of Israel

[v2]
 They looked up and saw a star
 shining in the East beyond them afar
 And to the earth he gave great light
 And so it continued both day and night

[v3]
 Then let us all with one accord,
 Sing praises unto our Heavenly Lord,
 That made the heavens and earth of naught,
 And with His blood mankind hath bought.</lyrics></song>
