  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 Flowers of the field,   see how God dress them beautifully 
 
 Look at the birds of the air,  they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet
 our Heavenly Father feeds them
 
 Lovely Father, He cares daily
 
 For God so loved the world, he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in 
 Him shall not perish but have eternal life
 
 
 
[V2]
 
 
 For all you need,  your lovely Heavenly Father already knew
 
 All you who are weary and burdened, He will give you rest
 
 Lovely Heavenly Father,  He cares daily
 
 He is the Almighty Lord, blessed is he who believes and trusts in Him
 </lyrics></song>
