  <title>O Holy Night</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 O Holy Night,the stars are brightly shining
 It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
 Fall on your knees,O night the angel voices
 O night divine,O night when Christ was born
 O night divine,O night,O night divine
[v2]
 Truly He taught us to love one another
 His law is love and His gospel is peace
 Chains he shall break,for the slave is our brother
 And in His name all oppression shall cease
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
 Let every heart adore His holy name
 Christ is the Lord,O praise His name forever
 His power and glory ever more proclaim
 His power and glory ever more proclaim</lyrics>
