  <lyrics>[v1]
 Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose
 and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
 All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
 They never let poor Rudolf join in any reindeer games;

[v2]
 Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say:
 "Rudolf with you nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
 Then how the reindeer loved him, as they shouted out with glee
 Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history.</lyrics></song>
