  <lyrics>[v1]
 Dashing through the bush in a rusty Holden ute,
 Kicking up the dust, Esky in the boot.
 Kelpie by my side, singing Christmas songs,
 Its summer time and I am in my singlet, shorts &amp; thongs

[c]
 Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
 Christmas in Australia on a scorching summer's day
 Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, Christmas time is beaut
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden ute.

[v2]
 Engine's getting hot, we dodge the kangaroos,
 The swaggie climbs aboard, he is welcome too.
 All the family is there, sitting by the pool,
 Christmas day in the Aussie way, by the Bar-b-que, Oh,

[v3]
 Come the afternoon grandpa has a doze,
 The kids and Mrs. Ces, are swimming in their clothes,
 The time comes round to go, we take a family snap,
 And pack the car and all shoot-through, before the washing up, Oh</lyrics></song>
