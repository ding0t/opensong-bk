  <lyrics>[V1]
 Break Thou the Bread of Life
 Dear Lord, to me,
 As You did break the loaves
 Beside the sea;
 Beyond the sacred page
 I seek You, Lord;
 My spirit pants for You
 0 living Word!

[V2]
 You are the Bread of Life
 0 Lord, to me,
 Your Holy Word of truth
 That saves me;
 Give me to eat and live
 With You above;
 Teach me to love Your truth
 For You are love!
 
[v3]
 0 send Your Spirit, Lord,
 Now unto me,
 That He may touch my eyes
 And make me see;
 Show me Your truth concealed
 With in Your Word,
 And in Your Book revealed,
 I see the Lord!   </lyrics></song>
