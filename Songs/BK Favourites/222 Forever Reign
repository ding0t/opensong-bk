  <title>Forever Reign</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are good,you are good
 When there's nothing good in me
 You are love,you are love
 On display for all to see
[V2]
 You are light,you are light
 when the darkness closes in
 You are hope,you are hope
 you have covered all my sin
[V3]
 You are peace,you are peace
 When my fear is crippling
 You are true, you are true
 Even in my wandering
[V4]
 You are joy,you are joy
 Your're the reason that I sing
 You are life,you are life
 In You death has lost its sting
[C]
 Oh I'm running to Your arms
 I'm running to Your arms
 The riches of Your love
 Will always be enough
 Nothing compares to Your embrace
 Light of the world forever reign
[V5]
 You are more,You are more
 Than my words will ever say
 You are Lord, You are Lord
 All creation will proclaim
[v6]
 You are here,you are here
 In your presence I'm made whole
 You are God,You are God 
 Of all else I'm letting go
[B]
 My heart will sing no other name
 Jesus Jesus</lyrics>
