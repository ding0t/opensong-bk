  <lyrics>[v1]
 Little baby in the manger.
 I Love You.
 Lying there to earth a stranger.
 I Love You.
 Wise men saw the star and answered
 I Love You.
 Shepherds heard the angels singing
 I Love You.
[v2]
 We may hear the Saviour saying
 I Love You.
 In our sleeping in our playing
 I Love You.
 In the dark or in the daytime
 I Love You.
 Tis the gentle shepherd saying
 I Love You.</lyrics></song>
