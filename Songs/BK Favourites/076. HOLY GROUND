[1]
 This is holy ground
 We're standing on holy ground
 For the Lord is present
 And where he is, is holy
      (repeat)
 
 
[c]
 We are standing on holy ground
 And I know that there are angels all around
 Let us praise Jesus now
 We are standing in his presence
 On holy ground
[2]
 This is holy ground
 We're standing on holy ground
 For the Lord is present
 And where he is,is holy
      (repeat)
