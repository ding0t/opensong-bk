  <lyrics>[V1]
 We plough the fields and scatter
 The good seed on the land
 But it is fed and watered
 By God's almighty hand.
 He sends the cold in winter
 The warmth to swell the firain
 The breezes and the sunshine
 And soft refreshing rain
 
[c]
 All good gifts around us
 are sent from heaven above
 Then thank the Lord. 0 thank the Lord
 For all His love
 
[v2]
 He, only, is the Maker
 Of all things near and far
 He paints the wayside flower
 He lights the evening star
 The winds and waves obey Him
 By Him the birds are fed
 Much more to us, His children
 He gives our daily bread
 
[v3]
 We thank Thee then, 0 Father
 For all things bright and good
 The seed-time and the harvest,
 Our life. our health, our food:
 Accept the gifts we offer
 For all Thy love imparts
 And, what You most desirest
 Our humble, thankful hearts.   </lyrics></song>
