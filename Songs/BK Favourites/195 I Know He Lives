  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 We have a strong and certain hope
 Fixed and unchanging, NOT in vain
 We have a friend in heaven's court
 Since Jesus rose to life again
 
[V2]
 
 We have an anchor for the soul
 Since Jesus blood has made a way
 Into the deepest heart of God
 Before the Father's throne of grace
 
[C]
 I know He lives, Jesus is alive
 And He reigns in glory now
 I know He lives and with him we'll rise
 Hallelujah!  I know He lives.
 
[V3]
 We have a King high over all
 The new creation's firstborn Son
 New heav'n and earth await his call
 We shall be like him when He comes
 
[Bridge]
 We see him now in majesty enthroned above the galaxies
 Until his glory burst the skies 
 And all creation joins the cry.
