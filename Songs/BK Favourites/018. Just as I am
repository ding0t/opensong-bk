  <lyrics>[V1]
 Just as I am, without one plea
 But that Your blood was shed for me,
 And that You bid me come to You,
 0 Lamb of God, I come, I come!
 
[V2]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
 Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
 Yes, all I need, in You I find
 0 Lamb of God, I come, I come!
 
[V3]
 Just as I am, You will receive,
 Will welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
 Because Your promise I believe
 0 Lamb of God, I come, I come!
 
[V4]
 Just as I am, Your love unknown
 Has broken every barrier down -
 Now to be Yours, yes, Yours alone
 0 Lamb of God, I come, I come!   </lyrics>
