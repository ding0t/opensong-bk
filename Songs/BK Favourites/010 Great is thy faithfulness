  <lyrics>[V1]
 Great is Thy faithfulness,
 Oh, God, my Father,
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
 Thou changest not,
 Thy compassions they fail not;
 As Thou hast been,Thou forever wilt be...
 
[C]
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Morning by morning new mercies I see!
 All I have needed Thy hand has provided,
 Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me!
 
[v2]
 Summer and winter,
 And springtime and harvest;
 Sun, moon and stars
 In their courses above,
 Join with all nature in manifold witness,
 To Thy great faithfulness mercy and love...
 
[v3] 
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
 Thine own dear presence
 To cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today,
 And bright hope for tomorrow;
 Blessings all mine
 And ten thousand beside...   </lyrics>
