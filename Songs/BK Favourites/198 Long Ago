  <lyrics>[v1]
 Long ago, long ago, on a bright star lit morn.
 Jesus came from heavn above.
 In a manger was born.
 Angels sang of His birth
 Wisemen came from afar.
 And they worshipped the King
 for they followed the star.
[v2]
 At this glad Christmas time
 We too worship our King.
 Who on calvry gave His life
 Our salvation to bring.
 Oh! rejoice evermore.
 Let us offer Him praise,
 Let our songs be of Him
 On this day of all days.
