  <title>Hallelujah for the Cross</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Up to the hill of Calvary
 My Savior went courageously 
 And there  he bled and died for me
 Hallelujah for the cross

[v2]
 And on that day the world was changed
 A final perfect lamb was slain
 Let earth and heaven now proclaim
 Hallelujah for the cross

[C]
 Hallelujah for the war he fought
 Love has won death has lost
 Hallelujah for the souls he bought 
 Hallelujah for the cross

[v3]
 What good I've done could never save
 My debt too great to for deeds to pay
 But God my Savior made a way
 Hallelujah for the cross

[v4]
 A slave to sin my life was bound
 But all my chains fell to the ground
 When Jesus' blood came flowing down 
 Hallelujah for the cross

[v5]
 And when I breathe my final breath
 I'll have no need to fear that rest
 This hope will guide me into death
 Hallelujah for the cross
