[1]
 Days are filled with sorrow and care
 Hearts are lonely and drear
 
[2]
 Cast your care on Jesus today
 Leave your worry and fear
 
[C]
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary
 Calvary, Calvary
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary
 Jesus is very near
 
[3]
 Troubled soul, the Saviour can see
 Every heartache and tear
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary
 Jesus is very near
 
[C]</lyrics>
