[V1]
 Light of the world, 
 You stepped down into darkness,
 Opened my eyes, let me see
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
 Hope of a life spent with You.
 
[C]
 So here I am to worship,
 Here I am to bow down,
 Here I am to say that You're my God;
 And You're altogether lovely,
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me.
 
[V2]
 King of all days,
 Oh so highly exalted,
 Glorious in heaven above;
 Humbly You came
 To the earth You created, 
 All for love's sake became poor.
 
[V3]
 And I'll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross.
 And I'll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross.
