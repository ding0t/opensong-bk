[V1]
 The old old story, it is ever new
 The old old story praise the Lord tis true
 That Jesus died for me as well as you
 I love the old old story
 When the roll is called up yonder
 I'll be walking down the King's Highway
 Tell me the old old story
 I love him better everyday Hallelujah
 I will make you fishers of men
 If you'll only follow me
 Now none but Christ can satisfy
 And there's no other name for me   </lyrics>
