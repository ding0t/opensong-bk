  <lyrics>[V1]
 Come and behold Him,
 come see His glory
 Come with an honest heart
 to see all He is;
 We will discover all of His beauty
 His light will burn away
 all the darkness we've known.
 
[C]
 Come and behold Him,
 come and behold Him
 Come with an honest heart
 to see all He is;
 Come and behold Him,
 wait now before Him
 Come with an honest heart
 to see all He is
 
[V2]
 Come and behold Him,
 come see His mercy
 Come find His tenderness
 Reaching to you.
 Just as a mirror shows a reflection
 His Word and Spirit come now reflecting His love  </lyrics>
