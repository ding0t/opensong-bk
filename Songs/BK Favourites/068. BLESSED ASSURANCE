[V1]
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
 O what a foretaste of glory divine!
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God
 Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood
 
[C]
 This is my story, this is my song:
 Praising my Saviour all the day long!
 [Repeat]
 
[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight!
 Visions of rapture now burst on my sight!
 Angels descending bring from above
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love
 
[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest
 I in my Saviour am happy and blest
 Watching and waiting, looking above
 Filled with his goodness, lost in his love
