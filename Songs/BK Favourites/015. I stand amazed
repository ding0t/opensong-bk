  <lyrics>[V1]
 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus, the Nazarene;
 And wonder how He could love me,
 A sinner, condemned, unclean...

[C]
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
 And my song shall ever be;
 How marvelous! How wonderful
 Is my Saviour's love for me!
 
[v2]
 For me it was in the garden
 He prayed, 'Not my will,but Thine",
 He had no tears for His own griefs
 But sweat drops of blood for mine...
 
[v3]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden to Calv'ry
 And suffered and died alone...   </lyrics></song>
