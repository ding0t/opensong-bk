  <title>My Redeemer</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I will sing of my Redeemer
 And his wondrous love to me.
 On the cruel cross he suffered
 From the curse to set me free.
[C]
 Sing,O sing of my Redeemer
 With his blood He purchased me.
 On the cross He sealed my pardon
 Paid the debt and made me free.
[V2]
 I will tell the wondrous story
 How my lost estate to save.
 In his boundless love and mercy
 He the ransom freely gave.
[V3]
 I will praise my dear Redeemer
 His triumphant power I'll tell.
 How the victory He giveth
 Over sin and death and hell.
