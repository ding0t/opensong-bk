  <lyrics>[V1]
 One day we'll see Him face to face,
 And then our hearts will beat as one,
 That day we'll know
 The glory of His grace,
 As we on earth have never known...

[v2] 
 Our hearts are gladdened in this world,
 When grace gives sudden
 Sights of love,
 But oh! how richer when
 Our hearts in hope
 Reach out to fuller bliss above...

[v3] 
 'Tis then the sights of heaven abound
 And flood our tired hearts of pain,
 The tears of wonder flow in ecstacy,
 And we are fully home again...

[v4] 
 Till then we live in present hope,
 In patience of the coming sight,
 And those who share with You
 Your glory now,
 We then will meet with great delight...

[v5] 
 Delight and bliss and joy and love
 As now our hearts cannot contain,
 Will flood us as we see Him face to face
 And we are wholly one again...   </lyrics></song>
