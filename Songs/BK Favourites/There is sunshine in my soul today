  <title>There is sunshine in my soul today</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 There is sunshine in my soul to-day,
 More glorious and bright
 Than glows in any earhly sky;
 For Jesus is my Light.
[C]
 Oh, there's sunshine,blessed sunshine,
 When the peaceful,happy moments roll;
 When Jesus shows His smiling face,
 There is sunshine in my soul.
[V2]
 There is music in my soul to-day,
 A carol to my King;
 And Jesus,listening,can hear
 The songs I cannot sing.
[V3]
 There is springtime in my soul to-day;
 For,when the Lord is near,
 The dove of peace sings in my heart,
 The flowers of grace appear.
[V4]
 There is gladness in my soul to-day,
 And hope,and praise,and love,
 For blessings which He gives me now,
 For joys laid up above.
