  <lyrics>[V1]
  Last night Jesus came to me, wiped the tears from my eyes.
  and he said not to worry so,He would stay by my side.
 
[C]
  Tell the people I love them,tell the people I care.
  When they feel far away from me,tell the people I'm there.
 
[V2]
  Then he looked out upon the world,in the darkness of night.
  and he turned and he spoke to me,oh so sadly He sighed.
 
 
[V3]
  When I walked upon calvary,and I poured out my life.
  I died for each one of them,so that they might have life.
