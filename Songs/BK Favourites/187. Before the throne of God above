[V1]
 Before the throne of God above,
 I have a strong, a perfect plea,
 A great High Priest whose name is Love,
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.
 ||My name is graven on His hands,
 My name is written on His heart;
 I know that while in heaven He stands 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart,
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
 
[V2]
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
 And tells me of the guilt within,
 Upward I look and see Him there 
 Who made an end to all my sin.
 ||Because the sinless Saviour died,
 My sinful soul is counted free;
 For God the Just is satisfied
 To look on Him and pardon me,
 To look on Him and pardon me.
 
[V3]
 Behold Him there! The risen Lamb,
 My perfect, spotless righteousness;
 The great unchangeable I AM,
 The King of glory and of grace!
 ||One with Himself I cannot die,
 My soul is purchased with His blood;
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
 With Christ, my Saviour and my God,
 With Christ my Saviour and my God.
