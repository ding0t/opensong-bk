[1]
 Morning has broken
 Like the first morning
 Blackbird has spoken
 Like the first bird
 Praise for the singing!
 Praise for the morning!
 Praise for them springing
 Fresh from the Word!
 
[2]
 Sweet the rain&apos;s new fall
 Sunlit from heaven
 Like the first dew-fall
 On the first grass
 Praise for the sweetness
 Of the wet garden
 Sprung in completeness
 Where his feet pass
 
[3]
 Mine is the sunlight!
 Mine is the morning
 Born of the one light
 Eden saw play!
 Praise with elation
 Praise every morning
 God&apos;s re-creation
 Of the new day!
