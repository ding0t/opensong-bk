  <lyrics>[V1]
 0 for a thousand tongues to sing
 My great Redeemer's praise.
 My great Redeemer's praise.
 The glories of my God and King,
 The triumphs of His grace!
 The triumphs of His grace!
 The triumphs of His grace!
 
[V2]
 My gracious Master and my God,
 Assist me to proclaim,
 Assist me to proclaim,
 To spread through all the earth abroad
 The honours of Your name...
 The honours of Your name...
 The honours of Your name...
 
 
[V3]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
 That bids our sorrows cease;
 That bids our sorrows cease;
 Tis music in the sinner's ears,
 Tis life, and health, and peace...
 Tis life, and health, and peace..
 Tis life, and health, and peace..
 
[V4]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
 He sets the prisoner free;
 He sets the prisoner free;
 His blood can make the foulest clean.
 His blood availed for me... 
 His blood availed for me...
 His blood availed for me...  </lyrics>
