[V1]
 Like a glorious fountain flowing
 Is the sparkling life of God;
 Flows this life into His children;
 All we have, and all we are,
 Is from our God.
 
[v2]
 Man becomes a surging fountain
 Flowing holiness and love;
 This is why he was created;
 All he has, and all he is,
 Is from our God.
 
[v3]
 Sin pollutes the holy fountain
 Sadly sluggish is its flow;
 Sin spreads slowly o'er creation;
 None of this, what man is now,
 Is from his God.
 
[v4]
 See the Cross - the cleansing fountain -
 See the mighty tide of love
 Flow through pain to purge creation;
 All of this, and what He does,
 Is from our God.
 


[V5]
 When the heart, the mind and
 conscience
 Know this purifying love,
 Then they share with all creation;
 All they have, and all they give
 Is from their God.

[V6]
 As a fountain freshly surging
 Springs the joy within the heart;
 Life again in Christ is thrilling;
 All we have, and all we are
 Is truly God's.

[V7]
 Lift your pure hearts in singing,
 Praise the victory of the Cross.
 Rise and live and share its power,
 All we have, and all we give,
 Is from our God.
