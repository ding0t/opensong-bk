  <lyrics>[V1]
 There is a place of quiet rest,
 Near to the heart of God;
 A place where sin cannot molest,
 Near to the heart of God...
 
[c]
 0 Jesus, blest redeemer,
 Sent from the heart ofGod,
 Hold us who wait before You,
 Near to the heart of God.

[V2]
 There is a place of comfort sweet,
 Near to the heart of God;
 A place where we our Saviour meet,
 Near to the heart of God...

[V3]
 There is a place of full release,
 Near to the heart of God;
 A place where all is joy and peace,
 Near to the heart of God...   </lyrics></song>
