  <title>37b What A Friend We Have In Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 What a friend we have in Jesus
 All our sins and griefs to bear
 What a privilege to carry
 Everything to God in prayer
 Oh,what needless pain we bare
 All because we do not carry 
 Everything to God in prayer
[v2]
 Have we trials and temptations
 Is there trouble anywhere
 We should never be discouraged
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
 Can we find a friend so faithful
 Who will all all our sorrows share
 Jesus knows our every weakness 
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
[v3]
 When the night has been too lonely
 And the road has been too long,and you think
 That love is only for the lucky and the strong
 Just remember in the winter
 Far beneath the bitter snow,lies the seed
 that with the sun's love
 In the spring becomes the rose
[v4]
 Are we weak and heavy laden
 Cumbered with a load of care
 Precious Saviour still our refuge
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
 Do your friends despise, forsake you
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
 In His arms He'll take and shield you 
 You will find a solace there</lyrics>
