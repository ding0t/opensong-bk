[V1]
 O love that wilt not let me go,
 I rest my weary soul in thee: 
 I give thee back the life I owe, 
 That in thine ocean depths its flow
 May richer, fuller be.
[V2]
 O light that followest all my way,
 I yield my flickering torch to thee: 
 My heart restores its borrowed ray,
 That in thy sunshine's blaze its day
 May brighter, fairer be.
[V3]
 O joy that seekest me through pain,
 I cannot close my heart to thee:
 I trace the rainbow through the rain,
 And feel the promise is not vain,
 That morn shall tearless be.
[V4]
 O cross that liftest up my head,
 I dare not ask to fly from thee:
 I lay in dust life's glory dead,
 And from the ground there blossoms red
 Life that shall endless be.
