  <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
 Doth His successive journeys run;
 His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
 Till moons shall wax and wane no more...

[V2]
 To Him shall endless prayer be made,
 And endless praises crown His head;
 His name like sweet perfume shall rise
 With every morning sacrifice...

[V3]
 Then all the earth shall rise and bring
 Peculiar honours to its King;
 Angels descend with songs again,
 And earth repeat the loud Amen...   </lyrics></song>
