  <lyrics>[v1]
 You're the Lion of Judah;
 the Lamb that was slain
 You ascended to heaven and evermore will reign.
 At the end of the age when the earth you reclaim,
 You will gather all nations before you.
 And the eyes of all man will be fixed
 on the Lamb who was crucified.
 For with wisdom and mercy and justice
 You'll reign at your Father's side.
[c]
 And the angels will cry "Hail the Lamb"
 Who was slain, for the world rule in power.
 And the earth will reply "You shall reign"
 As the King of all Kings and the Lord of all Lords.
[v2]
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side
 There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be denied.
 As the Father has told us, for these you died
 For the nations that gather before you.
 And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb
 who was crucified.
 Who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign
 at the Father's side.
