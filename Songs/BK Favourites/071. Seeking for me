  <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,
 Born in a manger to sorrow and shame;
 Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His name!
 Seeking for me, for me!

[v2]
 Seeking for me! for me!
 Seeking for me! for me!
 Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His name!
 Seeking for me, for me!

[v3] 
 Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary's tree,
 Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;
 Oh, it was wonderful, how could it be?
 Dying for me! for me!

[v4] 
 Dying for me! for me! Dying for me! for me!
 Oh, It was wonderful, how could it be?
 Dying for me, for me!
 
[v5]
 Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from on high,
 Sweet is the promise as weary years fly;
 Oh, I shall see Him descend from the sky,
 Coming for me, for me!

[v6] 
 Coming for me! for me!
 Coming for me! for me!
 Oh I shall see Him descend from the sky,
 Coming for me, for me!
