[1]
 Joyful, joyful, we adore you
 God of glory, Lord of love
 Hearts unfold like flowers before you
 Hail you as the Sun above
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
 Drive the dark of doubt away
 Giver of immortal gladness
 Fill us with the light of day
 
[2]
 All your works with joy surround you
 Earth and heaven reflect your rays
 Stars and angels sing around you
 Centre of unbroken praise
 Field and forest, vale and mountain
 Crashing sea and flowers in bloom
 Chirping bird and flowing fountain
 Call us to rejoice in you
 
[3]
 You are giving and forgiving
 Ever blessing, ever blest
 Wellspring of the joy of living
 Ocean depth of happy rest
 God our Father, Christ our Brother -
 All your own in love you bind
 Teach us how to love each other
 Lift us to your joy divine
 
[4]
 Mortals, join the mighty chorus
 Which the morning stars began
 Father love is reigning o&apos;er us
 Brother love binds man to man
 Ever singing, march we onward
 Victors in the midst of strife
 Joyful music lifts us Sunward
 In the triumph song of life!
