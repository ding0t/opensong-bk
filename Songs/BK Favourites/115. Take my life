  <lyrics>[V1]
 I WILL WORSHIP YOU,
 LIKE YOU WANT ME TO
 I WILL COME TO YOU IN SPIRIT
 AND IN TRUTH
 I WILL GIVE TO YOU,
 WHAT YOU ASK ME TO
 I WILL COME PRESENT
 MY OFFERING TO YOU.
 TAKE ALL MY PASSION AND PRIDE

[v2]
 TAKE EVERY FAITHLESS DESIRE
 CLEANSE ME FROM ALL THAT
 DEFILES
 TAKE ME LIFE, OH....LORD,
 TAKE MY LIFE.   </lyrics></song>
