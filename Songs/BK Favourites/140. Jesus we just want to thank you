 Jesus, we just want to thank You
 Jesus, we just want to thank You
 Jesus, we just want to thank You,
 Thank You for being so good.
[v2]

 Jesus, we just want to praise You
 Jesus, we just want to praise You
 Jesus, we just want to praise You
 Praise You for being so good.
[v3] 

 Jesus, we just want to tell You
 Jesus, we just want to tell You
 Jesus, we just want to tell You
 We love You for being You.
[v4]

 Saviour, we just want to serve You,
 Saviour, we just want to serve You,
 Saviour, we just want to serve You,
 Serve you for being so good.
[v5] 

 Jesus, we know You are coming,
 Jesus, we know You are coming,
 Jesus, we know You are coming,
 To take us to live in Your home.   </lyrics></song>
