  <lyrics>[V1]
 God sent His Son, they call Him Jesus,
 He came to love, heal and forgive.
 He lived and died to buy my pardon,
 An empty grave is there to prove
 My Saviour lives....

[C]
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow!
 Because He lives, all fear is gone;
 Because I know He holds the future,
 Andlife is worth the living
 Just because He lives!

[v2]
 How sweet to hold a new born baby,
 And feel the pride andjoy he gives;
 But greater still the calm assurance,
 This child can face uncertain days
 Because He lives...

[v3]
 And then one day I'll cross the river
 I'll flght life's f√≠nal war with pain;
 And then, as death gives way to victory
 I'll see the light of glory
 And I'll know He lives...</lyrics></song>
