  <lyrics>[1]
 Our Father, Who art in heaven
 Hallowed be Thy Name
 Thy Kingdom come
 Thy will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven
 Give us today our daily bread
 And forgive our sins
 As we forgive each one of those
 Who sin against us...
 ||And lead us not to the time of trial
 But deliver us from evil
 For Thine is the Kingdom
 The power and the glory.
 Let all the people say "Amen"
 In every tribe and tongue
 Let every heart's desire be joined
 To see the Kingdom come...
 ||Let every hope and every dream
 Be born in love again
 Let all the world sing with one voice
 Let the people say "Amen".
 Let all the world sing with one voice
 Let the people say "Amen".
