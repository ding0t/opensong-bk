  <lyrics>[V1]
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 That calls me from a world of care
 And bids me, at my Father's throne,
 Make all my wants and wishes known!
 In season's of distress and grief
 My soul has often found relief,
 And oft escaped the tempter's snare
 By your return, sweet hour of prayer...

[V2] 
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 Your wings shall my petitions bear
 To Him whose truth and faithfulness
 Engage the waiting soul to bless;
 And since He bids me seek His face,
 Believe His Word and trust His grace,
 I'll cast on Him my every care
 And wait for you, sweet hour of prayer...

[V3]
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 Sweet hour of prayer,
 May I your consolation share,
 Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height
 I view my home and take my flight;
 This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
 To seize the everlasting prize,
 And shout, while passing thru the air,
 "Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"   </lyrics></song>
