  <title>Be Thou My Vision Modern Lyrics</title>
  <lyrics>[VI]
 You are my vision, O king of my heart
 Nothing else satisfies, only you Lord
 You are my best thought by day or by night
 Waking or sleeping, Your presence my light.

[VII]
 You are my wisdom, you are my true word
 I ever with you and you with me Lord
 You're my great Father and I'm your true son
 You dwell inside me, together we're one.

[VIII]
 You are my battle-shield, sword for the fight
 You are my dignity, you're my delight
 You're my soul's shelter and you're my high tower
 Come raise me heavenward O power of my power.

[VIV]
 I don't want riches or man's empty praise
 You're my inheritance, now and always
 You and you only, the first in my heart
 High king of heaven, my treasure you are.

[vv]
 High king of heaven, when victory's won
 May I reach heaven's joy, O bright heaven's son
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
 Still be my vision, O ruler of all
