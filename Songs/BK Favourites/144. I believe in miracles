  <lyrics>[V1]
 Creation shows the power of God
 There's glory all around,
 and those who see must stand in awe,
 For miracles abound.
 
{c}
 I believe in miracles
 Iâ€™ve seen a soul set free,
 Miraculous the change in one redeemed thru calvary;
 I've seen the lily push its way
 Up through the stubborn sod
 I believe in miracles,
 For I believe in God!
 
[v2]
 I cannot doubt the work of God
 It's plain for all to see;
 The miracles that He has wrought
 Should lead to Calvary.
 
[v3]
 The love of God! 0 power divine!
 Tis wonderful to see
 The miracle of grace performed
 Within the heart of me.   </lyrics></song>
