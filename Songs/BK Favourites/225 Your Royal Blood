  <title>Your Royal Blood</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 What can wash away my sin
 What can make me whole again
 What can make me white as snow
 Nothing but your royal blood

[V2]
 What can heal the heart of stone
 What can resurrect these bones
 There's no other fount I know
 Nothing but your royal blood
 Nothing but your royal blood

[C]
 Your blood will never lose its power
 Your blood will never lose
 Your victory will stand forever
 Your blood will never lose

[V3]
 This was won upon the cross
 This was written on his scars
 This has made us conquerors 
 Nothing but your royal blood

[C]

[B]
 Now by this we'll overcome 
 Now by this we'll reach our home 
 Now our sin and shame are gone
 Only by your royal blood
 Only by your royal blood

[C]

[V4]
 Your blood will never lose
 Your blood will never lose</lyrics>
