  <lyrics>[v1]
 Jesus passed through Jericho
 as to the cross He went
 To the sinful and the lost
 the Son of God was sent
[c]
 In the cross,in the cross
 be my glory ever
 Till my raptured soul shall find
 rest beyond the river
[v2]
 All the suffering ones on earth
 the blind, the halt,and lame
 Called His kind compassion forth
 for unto them He came</lyrics></song>
