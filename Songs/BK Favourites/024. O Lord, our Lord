  <lyrics>[V1]
 0 Lord, our Lord,
 How majestic Thy name is,
 How great is Thy name
 In all the earth.
 Who hast set Thy glory
 Above the high heavens,
 And stilleth thy foes
 Through a child in its birth...

[v2]
 When I think of Thy heavens
 The works of Thy fingers,
 The moon and the stars,
 Which Thou has ordained
 What is man in Thy memory
 A man that Thou mindest
 The Son of Man
 That Thou carest for Him...

[v3] 
 Thou has made Him
 But a little lower than angels,
 And crowned Him
 With honour and glory,
 Thou gavest dominion
 Over all the wide earth,
 An all of the creatures
 That run in the sea.   </lyrics></song>
