  <lyrics>[V1]
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee;
 Let the water and the blood,
 From Thy riven side which flowed,
 Be of sin the double cure,
 Save me from its guilt and power...

[V2]
 Not the labour of my hands
 Can fulfil Thy law's demands;
 Could my zeal no respite know,
 Could my tears for ever flow,
 All for sin could not atone;
 Thou must save, and Thou alone...

[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring,
 Simply to Thy Cross I cling!
 Naked, come to Thee for dress
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
 Foul, I to the mountain fly
 Wash me, Saviour, or I die...

[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath,
 When mine eyes shall close in death,
 When I soar to world's unknown,
 See Thee on Thy Judgement Throne,
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee...   </lyrics></song>
