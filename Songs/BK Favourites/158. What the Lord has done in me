[1]
 Let the weak say, “I am strong”
 Let the poor say, “I am rich”
 Let the blind say, “I can see”
 It's what the Lord has done in me
 [Repeat]
 
[C]
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain!
 Hosanna, hosanna! Jesus died and rose again!
 [Repeat]
 
[C2]
;[Last chorus only]
 Jesus died and rose again! 
 [sing twice] 
[2]
 Into the river I will wade
 There my sins are washed away
 From the heavens' mercy stream
 Of the Saviour's love for me
 I will rise from waters deep
 Into the saving arms of God
 I will sing salvation songs
 Jesus Christ has set me free!
