[1]
 I know not why God's wondrous grace
 To me he has made known
 Nor why, unworthy as I am
 He claimed me for his own
 
[C]
 But I know whom I have believ√®d
 And am persuaded that he is able
 To keep that which I've committed
 Unto him against that day
 
[2]
 I know not how this saving faith
 To me he did impart
 Nor how believing in his Word
 Brought peace within my heart
 
[3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves
 Convicting men of sin
 Revealing Jesus through his Word
 Creating faith in him
 
[4]
 I know not whether good or ill
 May be reserved for me
 If weary days or golden days
 Before his face I see
 
[5]
 I know not when my Lord may come
 I know not how nor where
 If I shall walk the vale of death
 Or meet him in the air
