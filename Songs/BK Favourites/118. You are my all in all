[1]
 You are my strength when I am weak
 You are the treasure that I seek
 You are my all in all
 Seeking you as a precious jewel
 Lord, to give up, I'd be a fool
 You are my all in all
 
[C]
 Jesus, Lamb of God
 Worthy is your name
 Jesus, Lamb of God
 Worthy is your name
 
 
[2]
 Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
 Rising again â€“ I'll bless your name
 You are my all in all
 When I fall down, you pick me up
 When I am dry, you fill my cup
 You are my all in all
