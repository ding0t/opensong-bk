  <lyrics>[V1]
 0, what a wonderful wonderful day
 Day I will never forget;
 After I'd wandered in darkness away,
 Jesus my Saviour I met.
 0, what a tender,compassionate friend;
 He met the need of my heart;
 Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling
 He made all the darkness depart!
 
[C]
 Heaven came down
 And glory filled my soul!
 When at the Cross
 My Saviour made me whole!
 My sins were washed away
 And my night was turned to day;
 Heaven came down and glory
 Filled my soul!
 
[v2]
 Now I've a hope that will surely endure,
 After the passing of time;
 I have a future in heaven for sure,
 There in those mansions sublime.
 And it's because of that wonderful day,
 When at the Cross I believed;
 Riches eternal and blessing supernal
 From His precious hand I received...   </lyrics>
