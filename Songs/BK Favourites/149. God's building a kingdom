  <lyrics>[V1]
 God's building a Kingdom of people,
 Who learn how to follow His ways
 God's family is with Him forever,
 They're following Jesus today.
 
chorus
 Why don't you come and join in God's family?
 He'll help you to know what to do.
 There's room in God's family for everyone !
 He's ready to welcome you too !
