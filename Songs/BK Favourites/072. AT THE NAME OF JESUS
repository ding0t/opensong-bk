[1]
 At the name of Jesus
 Every knee shall bow
 Every tongue confess him
 King of Glory now
 This the Father's pleasure
 That we call him Lord
 Who from the beginning
 Was the mighty Word
 
[2]
 Humbled for a season
 To receive a name
 From the lips of sinners
 Unto whom he came
 Faithfully he bore it
 Spotless to the last
 Brought it back victorious
 When from death he passed
 
[3]
 Bore it up triumphant
 With its human light
 Through all ranks of creatures
 To the central height
 To the eternal Godhead
 To the Father's throne
 Filled it with the glory
 Of his triumph won
 
[4]
 In your hearts enthrone him
 There let him subdue
 All that is not holy
 All that is not true
 Crown him as your captain
 In temptation's hour
 Let his will enfold you
 In its light and power
 
[5]
 Brothers, this Lord Jesus
 Shall return again
 With his Father's glory
 Coming then to reign!
 For all crowns of empire
 Meet upon his brow
 And our hearts confess him
 King of glory now!
