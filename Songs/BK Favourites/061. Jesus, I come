  <lyrics>[V1]
 Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
 Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
 Out of my sickness into Thy health,
 Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
 Out of my sin and into Thyself,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!

[V2]
 Out of my shameful failure and loss,
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
 Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
 Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,
 Out of life's storms and into Thy calm,
 Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!

[V3]
 Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
 Into the joy and light of Thy home,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
 Out of the depths of ruin untold,
 Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
 Ever The glorious face to behold,
 Jesus, I come to Thee!

[V4]
