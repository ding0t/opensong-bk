  <lyrics>[V1]
 O let the Son of God enfold you
 With His Spirit and His love.
 Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.
 0 let Him have the things that hold vou.
 And His Spirit like a dove
 Will descend upon your life and make you whole.

[c]
 Jesus, O Jesus,
 Come and fill Your lambs.
 Jesus, 0 Jesus,
 Come and fill Your lambs.
 
[v2]
 0 come and sing this song with gladness
 As your hearts are filled with joy.
 Lift your hands in sweet surrender to His name.
 0 give Him all your tears and sadness.
 Give Him all your years of pain.
 And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.   </lyrics></song>
