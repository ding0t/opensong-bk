  <lyrics>[V1]
 I am so glad that our Father in Heaven
 Tells of His love in the book He has given:
 Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

[C]
 I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
 Jesus loves even me.

[V2]
 Though I forget Him, and wander away,
 Still He does love me wherever I stray;
 Back to His dear loving arms do I flee,    
 When I remember that Jesus loves me.

[V3]
 0 if there's only one song I can sing,
 When in His beauty I see the great King,
 This shall my song in etemity be,
 0 what a wonder that Jesus loves me,

v4
Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain Jesus loves me!


[V5]
 If one should ask of me: How can I tell?
 Glory to Jesus, I know very well;
 God's Holy Spirit with mine does agree,
 Constantly witnessing: Jesus loves me.   

v6
In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus I know I am blest;
Satan, dismayed, from my soul noes doth flee,
When I just tell him Jesus loves me.
