  <lyrics>[V1]
 When all my labours and trials are o'er
 And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
 Just to be near the dear Lord I adore
 Will through the ages be glory for me...

[C]
 0 that will be glory for me,
 Glory for me, glory for me;
 When by His grace
 I shall look on His face,
 That will be glory, glory for me!
 
[v2]
 When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
 I am accorded in heaven a place;
 Just to be there and to look on His face
 Will through the ages be glory for me...
 
[v3]
 Friends will be there I have loved long ago
 Joy like a river around me will flow;
 Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
 Will through the ages be glory for me...   </lyrics></song>
