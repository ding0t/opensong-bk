  <lyrics>[V1]
 Come as you are,that's how I want you
 Come as you are,feel quite at home.
 Close to my heart,loved and forgiven
 Come as you are,why stand alone?
 
[V2]
 No need to fear,love sets no limits
 No need to fear,love never ends.
 Don't run away,shamed and disheartened
 Rest in my love,trust me again.
 
[V3]
 I came to call sinners,not just the virtuous.
 I came to bring peace, not to condemn.
 Each time you fail to live by my promise
 Why do you think I'd love you the less?
 
[V4]
 Come as are,that's how I love you,
 Come as you are,trust me again.
 Nothing can change the love that I bear you.
 All will be well,just come as you are.</lyrics></song>
