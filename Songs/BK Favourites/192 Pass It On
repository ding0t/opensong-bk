  <lyrics>[V1]
 Have you had a kindness shown?
 Pass it on.
 Twas not given for thee alone.
 Pass it on.
 Let it travel down the years.
 Let it light anothers tears
 Till in heaven the deed appears.
 Pass it on.
 
[V2]
 Did you hear the loving word?
 Pass it on.
 Like the singing of a bird.
 Pass it on.
 Let its music live and grow.
 Let it cheer another's woe.
 You have reaped what others sow.
 Pass it on.
 
[V3]
 Be not selfish in thy greed.
 Pass it on.
 Look upon thy brothers need.
 Pass it on.
 Live for self,you live in vain.
 Live for Christ, you live again.
 Live for him,with him you reign.
 Pass it on.
