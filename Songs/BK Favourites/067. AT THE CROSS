[1]
 I'm not ashamed to own my Lord
 Or to defend his cause
 Maintain the honour of his Word
 The glory of his cross
 
[C]
 At the cross, at the cross
 Where I first saw the light
 And the burden of my heart rolled away
 It was there by faith
 I received my sight
 And now I am happy all the day!
 
[2]
 Jesus, my God! - I know his name
 His name is all my trust
 He will not put my soul to shame
 Nor let my hope be lost
 
[3]
 Firm as his throne his promise stands
 And he can well secure
 What I've committed to his hands
 Until that final hour
 
[4]
 Then he'll declare my worthless name
 Before his Father's face
 And in the new Jerusalem
 Appoint my soul a place
