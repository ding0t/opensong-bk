  <lyrics>[V1]
 To God be the glory
 Great things He has done
 So loved He the world
 That He gave us His Son
 Who yielded His life
 An atonement for sin
 And opened the Life-gate
 That all may go in...
 
[c]
 Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
 Let the earth hear His voice
 Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
 Let the people rejoice!
 0 come to the Father
 Thru Jesus the Son
 And give Him the glory
 Great things He has done!

[V2]
 0 perfect redemption,
 The purchase of blood!
 To ev'ry believer
 The promise of God;
 The vilest offender
 Who truly believes,
 That moment, from Jesus 
 A pardon receives...

[v3]
 Great things He has taught us,
 Great things He has done
 And great our rejoicing
 Thru Jesus the Son;
 But purer and higher
 And greater will be
 Our wonder, our transport,
 When Jesus we see....
