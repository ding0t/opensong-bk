  <lyrics>[V1]
 As the deer longs for flowing streams,
 So longs my soul for You, 0 God.
 My soul does thirst for the living God.
 When shall I come to see Your face?

[V2]
 My tears have fed me day and night,
 While men have said, "Where is your God?"
 But I recall as my soul pours dry
 The days of praise within Your House.

[V3]
 Why do I mourn and toil within,
 When it is mine to hope in God?
 I shall again sing praise to Him,
 He is my help, He is my God.   </lyrics></song>
