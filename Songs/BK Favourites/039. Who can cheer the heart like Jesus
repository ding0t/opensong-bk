  <lyrics>[V1]
 Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
 By His presence all divine?
 True and tender, pure and precious,
 Oh! how blest to call Him mine...

[c] 
 All that thrills my soul is Jesus!
 He is more than life to me!
 And the fairest often thousand,
 In my blessed Lord I see!

[v2] 
 Love of Christ so freely given,
 Grace of God beyond degree;
 Mercy higher than the heaven,
 Deeper than the deepest sea...
 
[v3]
 Every need His hand supplying,
 Every good in Him I see;
 On his strength divine relying,
 He is all in all to me!   </lyrics></song>
