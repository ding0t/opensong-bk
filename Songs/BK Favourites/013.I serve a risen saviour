  <lyrics>[V1]
 I serve a risen Saviour,
 He's in the world today;
 I know that He is living,
 Whatever men may say;
 I see His hand of mercy,
 I hear His voice of cheer;
 And just the time I need Him -
 He's always near...

[C]
 He lives! He lives!
 Christ Jesus lives today!
 He walks with me and talks with me
 Along life's narrow way.
 He lives! He lives!
 Salvation to impart -
 You ask me how I know He lives,
 He lives within my heart!

[v2] 
 In all the world around me
 I see His loving care,
 And though my heart grows weary
 I never will despair;
 I know that He is leading,
 Through all the stormy blast,
 The day of His appearing
 Will come at last...

[v3]
 Rejoice! rejoice! 0 Christian,
 Lift up your voice and sing;
 Eternal hallelujahs
 To Jesus Christ the King!
 The hope of all who seek Him,
 The help of all who flnd,
 None other is so loving,
 So good and kind...</lyrics></song>
