  <lyrics>[V1]
  Abide with me,
  Fast falls the eventide;
  The darkness deepens
  Lord, with me abide!
  When other helpers fail,
  And comforts flee,
  Help of the helpless,
  O abide with me....
 
[V2]
  I need your presence
  Every passing hour;
  What but your grace
  Can foil the tempter's power?
  Who like yourself my guide
  And stay can be?
  Through cloud and sunshine
  O abide with me...
 
[V3]
  I fear no foe, with
  You at hand to bless;
  Ills have no weight,
  And tears no bitterness;
  Where is death's sting?
  Where, grave your victory
  I triumph still
  If you abide with me.
