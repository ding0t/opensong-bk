  <title>226 Lord I Need You</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord I come,I confess
 Bowing here,I find my rest.
 And without you,I fall apart.
 Your the one that guides my heart.
[C]
 Lord I need you oh,I need you.
 Every hour I need you.
 My one defense, my righteousness
 Oh God how I need you.
[V2]
 Where sins runs deep,your grace is more.
 Where grace is found,is where you are.
 And where you are,Lord Iam free.
 Holiness is Christ in me.
[V3]
 So teach my song to rise to you.
 When temptation comes my way
 And when I cannot stand
 I'll fall on you.
 Jesus your my hope and stay.
