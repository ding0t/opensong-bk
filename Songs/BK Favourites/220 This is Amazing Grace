  <title>This is Amazing Grace</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
 The King of Glory, the king above all kings
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
 Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings

[c]
 This amazing grace
 This unfailing love
 That you would take my place
 That you would bear my cross
 That you would lay down your life
 That I would be set free
 Jesus, I sing for
 All that you've done for me

[v2]
 Who brings the chaos back into order
 Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
 The King of Glory, the king above all kings
 Who rules the nations with truth and justice
 Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
 The King of Glory, the king above all kings

[c]
 

[v3]
 Worthy is the lamb who was slain
 Worthy is the king who conquered the grave
 Worthy is the lamb who was slain
 Worthy is the King who conquered the grave

[c]
