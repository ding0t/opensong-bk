  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hark! The gospel news is sounding:
 Christ has suffered on the tree;
 Streams of mercy are abounding;
 Grace for all is rich and free.
 Now, poor sinner,
 Look to Him Who died for thee.
 
[v2]
 0 escape to yonder mountain!
 Now begin to watch and pray;
 Christ invites you to the fountain,
 Come, and wash your sins away:
 Do not tarry,
 Come to Jesus while you may.
 
[v3]
 Grace is flowing like a river;
 Millions there have been supplied;
 Still it flows as fresh as ever
 From the Saviour's wounded side:
 None need perish;
 All may live, for Christ hath died.
 
[v4]
 Christ alone shall be our portion;
 Soon we hope to meet above,
 Then we'II bathe in the ful ocean
 Of the great Redeemer's love;
 All His fullness,
 We shall then for ever prove.   </lyrics></song>
