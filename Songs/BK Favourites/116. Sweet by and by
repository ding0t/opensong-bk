  <lyrics>[V1]
 There's a land that is fairer than day
 And by faith we can see it afar
 For the Father waits over the way
 To prepare us a dwelling-place there.

[C]
 In the sweet by and by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore
 In the sweet by and by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore

[V2]
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore
 The melodious songs of the blest
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

[V3]
 To our bountiful Father above
 We will offer the tribute of praise
 For the glorious gift of His love
 And the blessings that hallow our days.   </lyrics></song>
