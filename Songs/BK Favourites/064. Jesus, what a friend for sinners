  <lyrics>[1]
 Jesus! What a friend for sinners!
 Jesus! Lover of my soul;
 Friends may fail me, foes assail me,
 He, my Saviour makes me whole.
 
[c]
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
 Hallelujah! what a Friend!
 Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
 He'll be with me to the end.
 
[2]
 Jesus! What a strength in weakness!
 Let me hide myself in Him;
 Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
 He, my Strength, my vict'ry wins...

[3] 
 Jesus! What a help in sorrow!
 While the billows o'er me roll,
 Even when my heart is breaking,
 He, my Comfort, helps my soul...

[4] 
 Jesus! What a Guide and Keeper!
 While the tempest still is high;
 Storms about me, night o'ertakes me,
 He, my Pilot, hears my cry...

[5] 
 Jesus! I do now receive Him;
 More than all in Him I find;
 He hath granted me forgiveness -
 I am His, and He is mine...
