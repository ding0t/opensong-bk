[C]
 Oh, the splendour of His greatness
 Oh, the beauty of His love,
 Oh, the depths of His forgiveness,
 The wonder of the Father's love.

[v1] 
 Jesus the lamb for sacrifice
 Shows forth His Father's plan;
 In love to bring back to His side
 The rebel heart of man...

[v2] 
 His Spirit freely given,
 Poured out on all who believe.
 That 'the God of creation
 Is mighty to save',
 And salvation I freely receive...

[v3] 
 Behold, our God makes all things new
 The Father of us all,
 And pure we bow before His throne
 In praise forever more...   </lyrics></song>
