[1]
 Be not dismayed whate'er betide
 God will take care of you
 Beneath his wings of love abide
 God will take care of you
 
[C]
 God will take care of you
 Through every day, o'er all the way
 He will take care of you
 God will take care of you
 
[2]
 Through days of toil when heart would fail
 God will take care of you
 When dangers fierce your path assail
 God will take care of you
 
[3]
 All you may need he will provide
 God will take care of you
 Nothing you ask will be denied
 God will take care of you
 
[4]
 No matter what may be the test
 God will take care of you
 Lean on him, weary one, there find rest
 God will take care of you
