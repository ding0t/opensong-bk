  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There is a green hill far away,
 Outside a city wall,
 Where the dear Lord was crucified,
 Who died to save us all.
[V2]
 We may not know, we cannot tell,
 What pains He had to bear;
 But we believe it was for us
 He hung and suffered there.
[V3]
 He died that we might be forgiven,
 He died to make us good,
 That we might go at last to heaven,
 Saved by His precious blood.
[V4]
 There was no other good enough
 To pay the price of sin;
 He only could unlock the gate
 Of heaven, and let us in.
[V5]
 O dearly, dearly has He loved!
 And we must love Him too,
 And trust in His redeeming blood,
 And try His works to do.
