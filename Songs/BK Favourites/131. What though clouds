  <lyrics>;"They saw no man save Jesus only" Matthew 17:8

[V1]
 What tho' clouds are hov'ring o'er me,
 And I seem to walk alone -
 Longing, 'mid my cares and crosses,
 For the joys that now are flown!
 If I've Jesus, "Jesus only",
 Then my sky will have a gem:
 He's the Sun of brightest splendour,
 And the Star of Bethlehem.
 
[v2]
 What tho' all my earthly journey
 Bringeth nought by weary hours:
 And, in grasping for life's roses,
 Thorns I find instead of flowers!
 If I've Jesus, "Jesus only"
 I possess a cluster rare;
 He's the "Lilly of the Valley",
 And the "Rose of Sharon" fair.
 
[v3]
 What though all my heart is yearning
 For the loved of long ago -
 Bitter lessons sadly learning
 From the shadowy page of woe!
 If I've Jesus, "Jesus only"
 He'II be with me to the end;
 And, unseen by mortal vision,
 Angel bands will o'er me bend.
 
[v4]
 When I soar to realms of glory,
 And an entrance I await,
 If I whisper, "Jesus only!"
 Wide will ope the pearly gate;
 When I join the heavenly chorus,
 And the angel-hosts I see,
 Precious Jesus, "Jesus only",
 Will my theme of rapture be.   </lyrics>
