  <lyrics>[V1]
 God is love! The Father is love and the Son is the Son of His Love
 The Son in this true love wants only to do all that pleases the Father
 above,
 The Spirit of love from the Father above pours out all of this love
 in the Son -
 So the Father, the Son and the Spirit all love and together in love
 they are One,
 Yes, the Father, the Son and the Spirit all love and together in love
 they are One.
 
[v2]

 God is love! Now look at that love in the earth and the sky and
 the sea!
 All of God's creatures in wondrous profusion all being what
 they're meant to be:
 The plants and the animals, fish and the birds, and the
 wonderful woman and man.
 All in order and harmony, working in love to partake in God's
 glorious plan!
 Yes, in order and harmony, working in love to partake in God's
 glorious plan.

[v3] 

 God is love! And in that great love which God had befre all
 things began,
 The Father of love with the Spirit and Son set out on this
 glorious plan:
 To make a new Heavens and Earth and a Family full of the fire
 Of His love
 Where the children of God in the Spirit and Son would be one
 with the Father above,
 Yes, the children of God in the Spirit and Son would be one with
 the Father above.

[V2]
 	
 God is love! And sure of that love He created in love you and
 me
 So whatever happened His love would prevail and we still could
 His Family be,
 In spite of God's love and against His goodwill we determined
 from God's love to stray.
 So then through all the pain God's love could come again in a
 deeper, more wonderful way.
 Yes, then through all the pain God's love could come again in a
 deeper, more wonderful way.

[V3]
 God is love! And when the time came as foretold in God's glorious plan
 The Son of His love from the Father above became everlastingly
 Man;
 Poured all of Himself into our humble flesh so with us He would
 ever be one
 As the brightness and image and fullness of God in the Father's
 beloved only Son
 Yes, the brightness and image and fullness of God in the Father's
 beloved only Son!

[V4]
 God is love! Messiah has come and God's glory shines out from
 His face
 As Christ by the Spirit goes driving out evil and pouring out grace
 upon grace
 Til hung on a cross and abandoned by all, bearing all of the guilt
 Of our sin,
 There He glorified all of the love of the Father to bring all the
 Family in -
 Yes, He glorified all of the love of the Father to bring all the Family in.
