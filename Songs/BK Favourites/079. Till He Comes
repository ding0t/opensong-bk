  <lyrics>[V1]
 "Till He come!" Oh let the words
 Linger on the trembling chords;
 Let the "little while" between
 In their golden light be seen:
 Let us think how Heaven and home
 Lie beyond that "Till He come!"

[v2] 
 When the weary ones we love
 Enter on their rest above -
 Seems the earth so poor and vast?
 All our life-joy over cast?
 Hush! be every murmur dumb;
 It is only "Till He come!"

[v3] 
 Clouds and conflicts round us press;
 Would we have one sorrow less?
 All the sharpness of the cross,
 All that tells the world is loss -
 Death, and darkness, and the tomb -
 Only whisper "Till He come!"

[v4] 
 See, the feast of love is spread,
 Drink the wine and break the bread -
 Sweet memorials - till the Lord
 Call us round His heavenly board;
 Some from earth, from glory some,
 Severed only "Till He come!"
