  <lyrics>[v1]
 I heard an old,old,story,how a Saviour came from glory,
 How He gave His life on calvary to save a wretch like me;
 I heard about His groaning of His precious blood's atoning,
 Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.
[c]
 O victory in Jesus my Saviour,forever!
 He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood;
 He loved me ere I knew Him,and all my love is due Him
 He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.
[v2]
 I heard about His healing,of His cleansing power revealing,
 How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see;
 And then I cried "Dear Jesus,come and heal my broken spirit,"
 And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.
[v3]
 I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory,
 And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea;
 About the angels singing and the old redemption story,
 And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.</lyrics></song>
