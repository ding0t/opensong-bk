[V1]
 I need thee every hour
 Most gracious Lord
 No tender voice like thine
 Can peace afford
 
[C]
 I need thee, oh, I need thee
 Every hour I need thee
 O bless me now, my Saviour
 I come to thee
 
[V2]
 I need thee every hour
 Stay thou near by
 Temptations lose their power
 When thou art nigh
 
[V3]
 I need thee every hour
 In joy or pain
 Come quickly and abide
 Or life is vain
 
[V4]
 I need thee every hour
 Teach me thy will
 And thy rich promises
 In me fulfil
 
[V5]
 I need thee every hour
 Most Holy One
 O make me thine indeed
 Thou blessed Son
