  <lyrics>[V1]
 I am running now the race to which
 He called me by His Grace,
 I am casting out the baggage
 which will keep me from His face.
 I am turning to the Lord
 and to the Promise of His Word.
 I am runn-ing now the race.
 

 Hold me Lord and keep me faithful
 Hold me Lord and keep me faithful
 Hold me Lord and keep me faithful
 I am running now the Race.
 

 I am living now the life
 and with the Glory of His might
 I am overcoming daily,
 I am living in His sight.
 I will live to show His Glory
 and to Praise His Name on high.
 I am living now the Life.
 

 Glory, Glory Hallelujah
 Hold me Lord and keep me faithful
 Glory, Glory Hallelujah
 I am living now the Life.   </lyrics></song>
