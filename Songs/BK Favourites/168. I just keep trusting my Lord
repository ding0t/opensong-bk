[1]
 I just keep trusting my Lord
 As I walk along
 I just keep trusting my Lord
 And he gives a song
 Though the storm clouds darken the sky
 O'er the heavenly trail
 I just keep trusting my Lord
 He will never fail!

[2]
 He's a faithful friend
 Such a faithful friend
 I can count on him to the very end
 Though the storm clouds darken the sky
 O'er the heavenly trail
 I just keep trusting my Lord
 He will never fail!
