  <lyrics>[v1] 
 When I am down and Oh my soul so weary,
 When troubles come and my heart burdened be.
 Then Iam still and wait here in the silence,
 until you come and sit awhile with me.
[c]
 You raise me up so I can stand on mountains,
 You raise me up to walk on stormy seas.
 Iam strong when Iam on your shoulders.
 You raise me up to more than I can be,
      (repeat chorus)
[v2]
 There is no life,no life without its hunger,
 Each restless heart beats so imperfectly.
 But when you come and Iam filled with wonder,
 Sometimes,I think I glimpse eternity.
[bridge]
 You raise me up to more than I can be
