  <lyrics> 
[1]
 May our homes be filled with dancing
 May our streets be filled with joy
 May injustice bow to Jesus
 As the people turn and pray
 
[C]
 From the mountain to the valley
 Hear our praises rise to you
 From the heavens to the nations
 Hear the singing fill the air
 
[C2]
 [Repeat chorus at end]
 
[2]
 May a light shine in the darkness
 As we walk before the cross
 May your glory fill the whole earth
 As the water o'er the seas
 
[3]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 [Repeat]
