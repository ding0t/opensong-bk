  <lyrics>[V1]
 Take time to be holy, speak oft with your Lord;
 Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word.
 Make friends of God's children;
 help those who are weak;
 Forgetting in nothing, His blessing to seek.

[v2] 
 Take time to be holy, the world rushes on;
 Spend much time in secret, with Jesus alone -
 By looking to Jesus, like Him you shall be;
 Your friends in your conduct, His likeness shall see.

[v3] 
 Take time to be holy, let Him be your Guide;
 And run not before Him, whatever betide;
 In joy or in sorrow, still follow your Lord,
 And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word.

[v4] 
 Take time to be holy, be calm in your soul;
 Each thought and each temper, beneath His control:
 Thus led by His Spirit, to fountains of love,
 You soon shall be fitted, for service above.   </lyrics></song>
