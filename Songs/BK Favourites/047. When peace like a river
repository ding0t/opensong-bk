  <lyrics>[V1]
 When peace, like a river,
 Attends my way,
 When sorrows like sea-billows roll
 What-ever my lot,
 You have taught me to say,
 It is well, it is well with my soul...
 
[C]
 It is well! With my soul
 It is well, it is well with my soul!
 
[v2]
 Tho Satan should buffet, 
 tho trials should come,
 Let this blest assurance control,
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
 And has shed His own blood for my soul...
 
[v3]
 My sin - O the bliss 
 of this glorious tho't - 
 My sin, not in part but in whole,
 is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,
 Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, O my soul...
 
[v4] 
 And, Lord, haste the day
 When my faith shall be sight.
 The clouds be rolled back
 As a scroll;
 The trump shall re-sound
 And the Lord shall descend
 Even so, it is well with my soul...   </lyrics>
