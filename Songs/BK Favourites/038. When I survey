  <lyrics>[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of Glory died.
 My richest gain I count but loss,
 And pour contempt on all my pride...

[v2] 
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the death of Christ my God;
 All the vain things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to His blood...
 
[v3]
 See! from His head, His hands,His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
[v4]
 Were the whole realm on nature mine,
 That were an offering far too small.
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my soul, my life, my all!   </lyrics></song>
