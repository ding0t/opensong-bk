  <lyrics>[V1]
 We praise and exalt You,
 And worship Your name.
 Today and forever,
 You're always the same.
 We praise You, our Saviour,
 The Lamb that was slain,
 We'll praise You forever
 The Lord is Your name.....
 
[c]
 Come ride in my life, Lord Jesus Christ,
 My Lord and my Master.
 Come ride in my life, Lord Jesus Christ,
 My whole desire.    
 Come rule in my life, Lord Jesus Christ,
 My King and my Master
 Come rule in my life, and I will be
 A chariot of fire....
 
[V2]
 I stand up to worship
 I rise to acclaim
 The King of all glory
 Christ Jesus, His name.
 I ask You, Lord Jesus
 Fulfil this desire
 Ignite me and make me
 A chariot of fire....
