  <title>My Lighthouse</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 In my wrestling and in my doubts
 in my failures you wont walk out
 Your great love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 O-oh You are the peace in my troubled sea

[V2]
 In the silence you wont let go
 In the questions your truth will hold
 Your great love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 O-Oh You are the peace in my troubled sea

[C]
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse
 Shining in the darkness I will follow you
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse
 I will trust the promise
 You will carry me safe to sho-o-o-o-o-o-ore
 Safe to sho o-o-o-o-o-ore x3

[V3]
 I wont fear what tomorrow brings
 With each morning I'll rise and sing
 My God's love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 O-Oh You are the peace in my troubled sea.

[V4]
 Fire before us, You're the brightest
 You will lead us through the storms x2
