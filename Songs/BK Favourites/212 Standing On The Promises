  <lyrics>[v1]
 Standing on the promises of Christ my King
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring.
 Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
 Standing on the promises of God.
[c]
 Standing,standing
 Standing on the promises of God my Saviour,
 Standing,standing
 I'm standing on the promises of God.
[v2]
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail.
 By the living word of God I shall prevail
 Standing on the promises of God.
[v3]
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
 Bound to Him eternally by loves strong cord,
 Over coming daily with the spirit's sword.
 Standing on the promises of God.</lyrics></song>
