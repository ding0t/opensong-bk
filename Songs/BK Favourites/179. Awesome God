  <title>179. Awesome God</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.           F#m
 Oh when He rolls up his sleeves He ain’t just puttin’ on the ritz;
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 Our God is an awesome God.
.
 There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists,
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 Our God is an awesome God.||
.        Bm7                                                 
 And the Lord wasn’t joking when He kicked ’em out of Eden,
.   C#m7                         Bm7      F#m     
 It wasn’t for no reason that He shed his blood;
.      D                              D/B         D/F#
 His return is very soon and so you’d better be believin’ that
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 Our God is an awesome God.
 
[C]
.    D         A               E           F#m            
 Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above;
.     D       A                    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 With wisdom, pow’r, and love, our God is an awesome God.
 
[V2]
.             F#m
 And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 Our God is an awesome God.
.
 He spoke into the darkness and created the light,
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m   
 Our God is an awesome God.||
.Bm7                                         
 Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom,
.C#m7               Bm7            F#m     
 Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross;
.  D                     D/B            D/F#
 I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
.    Bm7       C#m7    F#m
 Our God is an awesome God.</lyrics>
