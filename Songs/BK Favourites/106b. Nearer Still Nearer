  <lyrics>[1]
 Nearer still nearer, close to Thy heart
 Draw me my Savior. so precious Thou art
 Fold me, oh fold me, close to Thy breast
 Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest”
 Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest”

[2]
 Nearer still nearer, nothing l bring
 Naught as an offering to Jesus my King
 Only my sinful, now contrite heart
 Grant me the cleansing
    Thy blood doth impart
 Grant me the cleansing
    Thy blood doth impart

[3]
 Nearer still nearer, Lord to be Thine
 Sin with its follies l gladly resign
 All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride
 Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified
 Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified

[4]
 Nearer still nearer, while life shall last
 Till safe in glory my anchor is cast
 Thru endless ages, ever to be
 Nearer my Savior, still nearer to Thee
 Nearer my Savior, still nearer to Thee
