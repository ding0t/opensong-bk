  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 The splendour of the King
 Clothed in majesty
 Let all the earth rejoice
 All the earth rejoice
 He wraps himself in light
 And darkness tries to hide
 And trembles at His voice
 And trembles at His voice
 
[C]
 
 How great is our God, sing with me
 How great is our God
 And all will see... how great, how great, is our God
 
  
[v2]
 
 And age to age He stands
 And time is in His hands
 Beginning and the End
 Beginning and the End
 The Godhead three in one
 And Father, Spirit, Son,
 The Lion and the Lamb
 The Lion and the Lamb
 
[Coda]
 
 Name above all names
 Worthy of all praise
 My heart will sing
 How great is our God (repeat)</lyrics></song>
