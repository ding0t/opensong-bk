  <lyrics>[c]
 He is Lovely,He is holy,
 gave supremely,that all men may see.
 He is gentle,tender hearted.
 Risen Saviour,He is God.
 
[1]
 Master,Maker,Life Creator,
 come and dwell in me,
 that my heart may know your tender mercy.
 Shine through me that all may see,
 Your love so full and free;
 and I'll declare your praise
 through endless ages.
