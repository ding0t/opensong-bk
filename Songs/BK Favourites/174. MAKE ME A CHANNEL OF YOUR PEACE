[1]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 Where there is hatred let me bring your love
 Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord
 And where there's doubt, true faith in you
 
[C]
 O Master, grant that I may never seek
 So much to be consoled as to console
 To be understood as to understand
 To be loved as to love with all my soul
 
[2]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 Where there's despair in life let me bring hope
 Where there is darkness, only light
 And where there's sadness, ever joy
 
[3]
 Make me a channel of your peace
 It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
 In giving to all men that we receive
 And in dying that we're born to eternal life [End]
