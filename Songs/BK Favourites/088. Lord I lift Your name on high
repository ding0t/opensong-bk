 Lord, I lift Your Name on high,

 Lord, I love to sing Your praises;
.G      C                 D    C D
 I'm so glad You're in my life,
.G      C                D        D C
 I'm so glad you came to save us.

 You came from heaven to earth to show the way,
.G        C            D        C    D  G
 From the earth to the cross my debt to pay;

 From the cross to the grave,

 From the grave to the sky,
.        Am        D       G     (C D)
 Lord, I lift Your Name on high.
