  <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord's my Shepherd
 I'll not want
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green; He leadeth me
 The quiet waters by....
 
[v2]
 My soul He doth restore again,
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness,
 E'en for His own name's sake...

[v3] 
 Yes, though I walk in
 Death's dark vale,
 Yet will I fear no ill;
 For Thou art with me and Thy rod
 And staff me comfort still...

[v4] 
 My table Thou hast furnished
 In presence of my foes
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
 And my cup overflows...

[v5] 
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me,
 And in God's house for evermore
 My dwelling place shall be.   </lyrics></song>
