  <lyrics>[V1]
 It only takes a spark
 To get the fire going,
 And soon all those around
 Can warm up in it's glowing;
 That's how it is with God's love,
 Once you've experienced it
 You spread His love to everyone,
 You want to pass it on...
 
[v2]
 What a wondrous time is spring
 When all the trees are budding;
 The birds begin to sing
 The flowers start their blooming;
 That's how it is with God's love,
 Once you've experienced it;
 You want to sing, its fresh like spring
 You want to pass it on...

[V3]
 I wish for you, my friend,
 This happiness that I've found;
 You can depend on Him,
 It matters not where you're bound;
 I'll shout it from the mountain top,
 I want the world to know;
 the Lord of love has come to me,
 I want to pass it on!
