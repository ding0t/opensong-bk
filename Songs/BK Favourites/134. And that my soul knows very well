  <lyrics>[V1]
 You make your face to shine on me
 And that my soul knows very well
 You lift me up I’m cleansed I’m free
 And that my soul knows very well


[C]
 When mountains fall I’ll stand
 By the power of your hand
 And in your heart of hearts I'll dwell
 And that my soul knows very well

[V2]
 Joy and strength each day I’ll find
 And that my soul knows very well
 Forgiveness, hope I know is mine
 And that my soul knows very well

[V3]
 When mountains fall I’ll stand
 By the power of your hand
 And in your heart of hearts I'll dwell
 And that my soul knows very well
