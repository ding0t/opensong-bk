  <lyrics>[v1]
 You are the first,You go before,
 You are the last,Lord You're the encore.
 Your name's in lights for all to see,
 The starry host declare Your glory.
[c]
 Glory in the highest,
 Glory in the highest,
 Glory in the highest.
[v2]
 Apart from You there is no God,
 Light of the world,the bright morning star.
 Your name will shine for all to see,
 You are the one,You are my glory.
[c]
[v3]
 And no one else could ever compare to You,Lord.
 All the earth together declare:
 
[c2]
 Glory in the highest,
 Glory in the highest,
 Glory in the highest,
 to You Lord,to You Lord. [ repeat chorus] 
 
 
 
[Ending]
 All the earth will sing Your praise,
 The moon and stars,the sun and rain.
 Ev-'ry nation will proclaim,
 That You are God and You will ransom.
 Glory,glory Hallelujah,
 Glory,glory to You Lord.
 Glory,glory Hallelujah,Hallelujah.</lyrics></song>
