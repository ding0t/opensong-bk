  <lyrics>[1] 
 Sing them over again to me- Wonderful words of life;
 Let me more of their beauty see- Wonderful words of life;
 Words of life and beauty, teach me faith and duty
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, - Wonderful words of life;

[2]
 Christ the blessed One gives to all- Wonderful words of life;
 Sinner list to the loving call- Wonderful words of life;
 All so freely given, Wooing us to heaven;
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, - Wonderful words of life;

[3]
 Sweetly echo the gospel call- Wonderful words of life;
 Offer pardon and peace to all- Wonderful words of life;
 Jesus only saviour, Sanctify forever;
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, - Wonderful words of life;
