  <lyrics>[V1]
 I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
 I'm accepted, You were condemned
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
 Because You died and rose again.
 
[C]
 Amazing love, how can it be
 That You my King would die for me?
 Amazing love, I know it's true,
 And it's my joy to honor you
 In all I do, I honor You.
 
[B]
 
 You are my King
 You are my King
