  <lyrics>[V1]
 Rejoice and be glad ! the Redeemer has come:
 Go, look on His cradle, His cross and His tomb.
 
[c]
 Sound His praises, tell the story of Him who was slain;
 Sound His praises, tell with gladness He liveth again.
 
[v2]
 Rejoice and be glad ! For the blood has been shed ;
 Redemption is finished , the price has been paid.
 
[v3]
 Rejoice and be glad ! Now the pardon is free ;
 The just for the unjust has died on the tree.
 
[v4]
 Rejoice and be glad; for the lamb that was slain ,
 O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again.
 
[v5]
 Rejoice and be glad ! For He cometh again ;
 He cometh in glory, the lamb that was slain.
