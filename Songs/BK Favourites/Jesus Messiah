  <title>Jesus Messiah</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 He became sin, Who knew no sin
 That we might become, His Righteousness
 He humbled Himself, and carried the cross
 Love so amazing, Love so amazing
[C]
 Jesus Messiah, Name above all names
 Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
 The rescue for sinners, The ransom from Heaven
 Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[V2]
 His body the bread, His blood the wine
 Broken and poured out, all for love
 The whole earth trembled, and the veil was torn
 Love so amazing, Love so amazing
[Bridge]
 All our hope is in You
 All our hope is in You
 All the glory to You, God
 The light of the world</lyrics>
