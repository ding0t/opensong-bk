[V1]
 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus!
 Sing his mercy and his grace!
 In the mansions bright and blessed
 He'll prepare for us a place
 
[C]
 When we all get to heaven
 What a day of rejoicing that will be!
 When we all see Jesus
 We'll sing and shout the victory!
 
[V2]
 While we walk this pilgrim pathway
 Clouds will overspread the sky
 But when travelling days are over
 Not a shadow, not a sigh!
 
[V3]
 Let us then be true and faithful
 Trusting, serving, every day
 Just one glimpse of him in glory
 Will the toils of life repay
 
[V4]
 Onward to the prize before us!
 Soon his beauty we'll behold
 Soon the pearly gates will open
 We shall walk the streets of gold!
