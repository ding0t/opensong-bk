  <lyrics>[V1]
 Glory and honour to God
 Glory and honour forever
 Glory and honour to God
 Glory and honour belong to Him

[V2]
 He who formed to heavens
 He who knows the stars by name
 Author of all life
 Full of wisdom, full of love

[V3]
 Who compares to you?
 Who has been your counsellor?
 Author of all life
 Full of wisdom, full of love   </lyrics></song>
