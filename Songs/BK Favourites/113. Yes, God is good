  <lyrics>[V1]
 Yes. God is good - in earth and sky
 From ocean depths and spreading wood
 Ten thousand voices seem to cry
 God made us all and God is good.
 
[v2]
 The sun that keeps His trackless way
 And downward pours His golden flood
 Night's sparkling hosts, all seem to say
 In accents clear. that God is good.
 
[v3]
 Yes, God is good. all nature says
 By God's own hand with speech endued
 And man, in louder notes of praise
 Should sing for joy that God is good.
 
[v4]
 For all Thy gifts we bless Thee, Lord
 But chiefly for our heavenly food
 Thy pardoning grace, Thy quickening word
 These prompt our song. that God is good.   </lyrics></song>
