  <lyrics>[V1]
 As the deer pants for the water,
 So my soul longs after You.
 You alone are my heart's desire
 And I long to worship You...
 
[c]
 You alone are my strength and shield
 To You alone may my spirit yield;
 You alone are my heart's desire
 And I long to worship You.
 
[V2]
 I want You more than gold or silver
 Only You can satisfy;
 You alone are the real joy giver,
 And the apple of my eye...
 
[V3]
 You're my friend and You are my brother
 Even tho' You are my King.
 I love You more than any other,
 So much more than anything...   </lyrics>
