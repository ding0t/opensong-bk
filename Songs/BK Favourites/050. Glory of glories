  <lyrics>[V1]
 Glory of glories, Jesus my Saviour
 Came to redeem us from guilt and shame;
 Sent by the Father to gather His children,
 Making us holy and free from all stain....
 
[v2]
 Gracious Lord Jesus
 Despised and afflicted,
 Went to the cross as a lamb in our place;
 Bore all our hatred,
 Its judgement completed.
 Freed us forever to live by His grace...

[v3] 
 Rose He triumphant, exalted, ascended!
 Death now defeated He reigns as our Lord;
 Poured out His Spirit
 Who brings us forgiveness,
 Fills us with power
 To tell forth His Word...
 
[v4]
 Praise to the Father,
 Praise to our Saviour,
 Praise to the Spirit
 Who brings us new birth;
 Stand we in wonder
 To worship His splendour
 So come spread His praises
 Throughout all the earth....   </lyrics></song>
