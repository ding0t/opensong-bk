  <title>Ah Lord God</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Ah Lord God
 Thou has made the heavens 
 and the earth by thy great power
 Ah Lord God
 Thou has made the heavens 
 and the Earth by thy outstretched arm

[v2]
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee
 Great and mighty God
 Great in counsel and mighty indeed (mighty indeed)
 Nothing, nothing absolutely nothing 
 nothing is too difficult for Thee</lyrics>
