[v1]
 Jesus loves me, this I know
 For the Bible tells me so
 Little ones to him belong
 They are weak, but he is strong
 
 
[v2]
 Jesus loves me â€“ he who died
 Heaven's gate to open wide
 He will wash away my sin
 Let his little child come in
 
[v3]
 Jesus loves me, he will stay
 Close beside me all the way
 Since I love Him when I die
 He will take me home on high

[CH]
 Yes, Jesus loves me
 Yes, Jesus loves me
 Yes, Jesus loves me,
 The Bible tells me so
