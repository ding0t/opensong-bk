[V1]
 "Man of sorrows", what a name
 For the Son of God who came
 Ruined sinners to reclaim;
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
 
[v2]
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
 In my place condemned He stood;
 Sealed my pardon with His blood;
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[v3] 
 Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
 Spotless Lamb of God was He
 "Full atonement"! - can it be?
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[v4] 
 "Lifted up" was He to die,
 "It is finished!" was His cry;
 Now in heaven exalted high
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[v5] 
 When He comes, our glorious King
 All His ransomed home to bring,
 Then anew this song we'll sing;
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!   </lyrics></song>
