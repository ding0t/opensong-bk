  <lyrics>[V1]
 Guide me, 0 Thou great Jehovah!
 Pilgrim through this barren land;
 I am weak, but You are mighty,
 Hold me with Your powerful hand;
 Bread of Heaven!Bread of Heaven!
 Feed me now and evermore...
 Feed me now and evermore...

[V2]
 Open now the crystal fountain
 Whence the healing stream does flow;
 Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
 Lead me all my journey through;
 Strong deliverer!Strong deliverer!
 Be You still my strength and shield...
 Be You still my strength and shield...

[V3]
 When I tread the verge of Jordan
 Bid my anxious fears subside;
 Bear me through the swelling waters,
 Lead me safe on Canaan's side;
 Songs of praises, Songs of praises
 I will ever give to You.  
 I will ever give to You.   </lyrics>
