[V1]
 Almighty sovereign Lord, Creator God,
 You made the heavens and the earth.
 You've spoken to the world,
 Yourself the living Word,
 You give us eyes to see Your kingdom.
[C]
 So stretch out Your hand, O God,
 In signs and wonders,
 We rest our faith on Your almighty power.
 Stretch out Your hand, O God,
 To heal and deliver. We declare,
 We declare Your kingdom is here.
[V2]
 Stir up Your people like a mighty wind,
 Come shake us, wake us from our sleep.
 Give us compassion, Lord,
 Love for Your holy word,
 Give us the courage of Your kingdom.
[V3]
 Why do so many stand against You now,
 Bringing dishonour to Your name?
 Consider how they mock,
 But we will never stop
 Speaking with boldness of Your kingdom.
