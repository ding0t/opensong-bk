  <lyrics>[V1]
 Faith of our fathers, living still
 In spite of dungeon, fire and sword
 0 how our hearts beat high with joy
 Whene're we hear that glorious word!
 
[c]
 Faith of our fathers, holy faith
 We will be true to thee till death.

[V2]
 Faith of our fathers, we will strive
 To win all nations unto thee
 And through the truth
 that comes from God
 Mankind shall then indeed be free...

[V3]
 Faith of our fathers, we will love
 Both friend and foe in all our strife
 And preach thee, too
 As love knows how
 By kindly words and virtuous life...   </lyrics></song>
