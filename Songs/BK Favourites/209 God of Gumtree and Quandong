  <lyrics>[V1]
 God of Gumtree and of Quandong,
 Granite rocks and rolling plain;
 God of pasture,sheep and cattle,
 Fallow land and crops and grain.
 You are always here around us,
 Even when we do not know;
 Help us realise your presence,
 That our spirit life may grow.
[V2]
 Ploughing,seeding,patient waiting
 For the harvest of the soil;
 Shearing,branding,culling,feeding,
 You are with us in our toil.
 In the workshop,store and office
 Classroom,kitchen,garden too;
 Help us see your gifts and glory,
 Serve you well in all we do.
[V3]
 Scattered in our congregations,
 Yet one body called to be;
 Reaching out to fellow Christians;
 Serving the community.
 Thanks to you for love which binds us,
 For the strength to do your will.
 Father,keep us true and faithful;
 May we love and serve you still.
