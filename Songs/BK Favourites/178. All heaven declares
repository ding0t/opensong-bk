[V1]
 All heaven declares
 The glory of the risen Lord.
 Who can compare
 With the beauty of the Lord?
 Forever He will be
 The Lamb upon the throne.
 I gladly bow the knee
 And worship Him alone.
[V2]
 I will proclaim
 The glory of the risen Lord,
 Who once was slain
 To reconcile man to God.
 Forever You will be
 The Lamb upon the throne.
 I gladly bow the knee
 And worship You alone.
