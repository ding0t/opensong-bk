[1]
 From heav'n you came, helpless babe
 Entered our world, your glory veiled
 Not to be served, but to serve
 And give your life that we might live
 
[C]
 This is our God -
 The Servant King
 He calls us now to follow him
 To bring our lives
 As a daily offering
 Of worship to the Servant King
 
[2]
 There in the garden of tears
 My heavy load he chose to bear
 His heart with sorrow was torn
 Yet "Not my will, but yours," he said
 
[3]
 Come see his hands and his feet
 The scars that speak of sacrifice
 Hands that flung stars into space
 To cruel nails surrendered
 
[4]
 So let us learn how to serve
 And in our lives enthrone him
 Each other's needs to prefer
 For it is Christ we're serving
