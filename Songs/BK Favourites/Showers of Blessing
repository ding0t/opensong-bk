  <title>Showers of Blessing</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 "There shall be showers of blessing"
 This is the promise of love;
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 Sent from the Saviour above.
[C]
 Showers of blessing,
 Showers of blessing we need;
 Mercy-drops round us are falling,
 But for the showers we plead.
[V2]
 "There shall be showers of blessing"
 Precious reviving again;
 Over the hills and the valleys,
 Sound of abundance of rain.
[V3]
 "There shall be showers of blessing"
 Send them upon us, O Lord!
 Grant to us now a refreshing;
 Come,and now honour Thy word.
[V4]
 "There shall be showers of blessing"
 Oh that to-day they might fall,
 Now as to God we're confessing,
 Now as on Jesus we call!</lyrics>
