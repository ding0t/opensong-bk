  <lyrics>[V1]
 All hail the power of Jesus name;
 Let angels prostrate fall.
 Bring forth the royal diadem
 And crown Him Lord of all...
 
[v2]
 Crown Him, you martyrs of our God
 Who from His alter call;
 Extol Him in whose path you trod
 And crown Him Lord of all...
 
[v3]
 Let every kindred, every tribe,
 On this terrestrial ball,
 To Him all majesty ascribe,
 And crown Him Lord of all   </lyrics></song>
