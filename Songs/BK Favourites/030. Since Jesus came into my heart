  <lyrics>[V1]
 What a wonderful change
 In my life has been wrought
 Since Jesus came into my heart!
 I have light in my soul
 For which long I had sought
 Since Jesus came into my heart...

[C]
 Since Jesus came into my heart
 Since Jesus came into my heart
 Floods of joy o 'er my soul
 Like the sea billows roll
 Since Jesus came into my heart!

[v2] 
 I have ceased from my wandering
 And going astray,
 Since Jesus came into my heart;
 And my sins which were many
 Are all washed away
 Since Jesus came into my heart...

[v3] 
 I'm possessed of a hope
 That is stead fast and sure
 Since Jesus came into my heart,
 And no dark clouds of doubt
 Now my pathway obscure
 Since Jesus came into my heart...   </lyrics></song>
