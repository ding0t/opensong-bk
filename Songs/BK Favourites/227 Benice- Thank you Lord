  <title>227 Benice- Thank you Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 As the world looks upon me
 As I struggle along.
 They say I have nothing
 But they are so wrong.
 In my head I'm rejoicing
 How I wish they could see.
 Thank you Lord
 For your blessings on me!
[C]
 There's a roof up above me
 I've got a good place to sleep.
 There's food on my table
 And shoes on my feet.
 You gave me your love lord
 And a fine family.
 Thank you Lord
 For your blessings on me!
[V2]
 I know I'm not wealthy
 And these clothes are not new.
 I don't have much money
 But Lord, I have you.
 To me,that's all that matters.
 Though the world may not see.
 Thank you Lord
 For your blessings on me!
