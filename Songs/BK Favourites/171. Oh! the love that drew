  <lyrics>[V1]
 Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
 Oh, the grace that brought it down to man
 Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
     At Calvary	
 
[v2]
 Mercy there was great, and grace was free
 Pardon there was multiplied to me
 There my burdened soul found liberty
     At Calvary   </lyrics></song>
