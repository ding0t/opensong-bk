  <lyrics>[v1]
 Long time ago in Bethlehem
 so the Holy Bible say,
 Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,
 was born on Christmas Day.
[c]
 Hark, now, hear the angels sing:
 A new king born today,
 and man will live for evermore
 because of Christmas day
 Trumpets sound and angels sing
 listen to what they say,
 that man will live for evermore
 because of Christmas Day.
[v2]
 By and by they find little nook
 in a stable all forlorn,
 and in a manger cold and dark,
 Marys little boy was born.
