  <lyrics>[V1]
 God be with you till we meet again
 By His counsels guide, uphold you
 With His sheep securely fold you
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
[c]
 Till we meet! Till we meet!
 Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
 Till we meet! Till we meet!
 God be with you till we meet again!
 
[v2]
 God be with you till we meet again
 'Neath His wings securely hide you
 Daily manna still provide you
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
[v3]
 God be with you till we meet again
 When life's perils thick confound you
 Put His loving arms around you
 God be with you till we meet again.   </lyrics></song>
