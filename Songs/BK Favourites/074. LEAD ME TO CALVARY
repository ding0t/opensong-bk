[1]
 King of my life I crown Thee now
 Thine shall the glory be
 Lest I forget thy thorn-crowned brow
 Lead me to Calvary
 
[C]
 Lest I forget Gethsemane
 Lest I forget Thine agony
 Lest I forget Thy love for me
 Lead me to Calvary
 
[2]
 Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid
 Tenderly mourned and wept
 Angels in robes of light arrayed
 Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept
 
[3]
 Let me like Mary, through the gloom
 Come with a gift for Thee
 Show to me now the empty tomb
 Lead me to Calvary
 
[4]
 May I be willing, Lord, to bear
 Daily, for you, my cross for Thee
 Even Thy cup of grief to share
 Thou hast borne all for me
