  <title>Down To The River To Pray</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 As I went down in the river to pray,
 Studying about that good old way
 And who shall wear the starry crown,
 Good Lord,show me the way.
 Oh sisters let's go down,let's go down,come on down
 Oh sisters let's go down,down in the river to pray
[V2]
 As I went down in the river to pray,
 Studying about that good old way
 And who shall wear the robe and crown,
 Good Lord,show me the way.
 Oh brothers let's go down,let's go down,come on down
 Come on brothers let's go down,down in the river to pray
[V3]
 As I went down in the river to pray,
 Studying about that good old way
 And who shall wear the starry crown,
 Good Lord,show me the way.
 Oh fathers let's go down,let's go down,come on down
 Oh fathers let's go down,down in the river to pray
[V4]
 As I went down in the river to pray,
 Studying about that good old way
 And who shall wear the robe and crown,
 Good Lord,show me the way.
 Oh mothers let's go down,come on down,
 Don't you wanna go down
 Come on mothers let's go down,down in the river to pray
[V5]
 As I went down in the river to pray,
 Studying about that good old way
 And who shall wear the starry crown,
 Good Lord,show me the way.
 Oh sinners let's go down,let's go down,come on down
 Oh sinners let's go down,down in the river to pray
