  <lyrics>[V1]
 A ray of hope flickers in the sky,
 A tiny star lights up way up high,
 All across the land
 dawns a brand new morn',
 This comes to pass
 when a child is born.

[V2]
 A silent wish sails the seven seas,
 The winds of change
 whisper in the trees,
 And the walls of doubt
 Crumble tossed and torn,
 This comes to pass
 When a child is born.

[V3]
 A rosy dawn settles all around,
 You get the feel you're on solid ground,
 For a spell or two
 No one seems forlorn,
 This comes to pass
 When a child is born.

[V4]
 A promise true, now reality,
 Our Saviour's born -
 God's great gift we see,
 All across the land
 Dawns a brand new morn,
 This comes to pass,
 when a child is born.   </lyrics></song>
