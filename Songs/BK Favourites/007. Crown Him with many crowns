  <lyrics>[V1]
 Crown Him with many crowns
 The Lamb upon His throne
 Hark! how the heavenly
 Anthem drowns
 All music but its own
 Awake, my soul and sing
 Of Him who died for me
 And hail Him as Your matchless King
 Through all eternity...
 
[V2]
 Crown Him the Lord of Love
 Behold His hands and side
 Those wounds yet visible above
 In beauty glorified.
 No angel in the sky
 Can fully bear that sight
 But downward bends His burning eye
 At mysteries so bright...
 
[V3]
 Crown Him the Lord of years
 The Potentate of time
 Creator of the rolling spheres
 Ineffably sublime!
 All hail, Redeemer, hail!
 For You have died for me
 Your praise shall never,never fail
 Throughout eternity   </lyrics>
