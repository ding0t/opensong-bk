  <lyrics>[V1]
 I've got a home in Glory Land that outshines the sun,
 I've got a home in Glory Land that outshines the sun,
 I've got a home in Glory Land that outshines the sun
 'Way beyond the blue.

[V2]
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me,
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me,
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me
 'Way beyond the blue.

[V3]
 I took Jesus as my Saviour, you take Him too,
 I took Jesus as my Saviour, you take Him too,
 I took Jesus as my Saviour, you take Him too,
 While He's calling you.

[V4]
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me,
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me,
 Do Lord-0 do, Lord-0 do remember me__
 'Way beyond the blue.   </lyrics></song>
