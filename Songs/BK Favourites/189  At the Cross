  <lyrics>[v1]
 O Lord you've searched me
 You Know my way
 Even when I fail You
 I know you love me
 I know you love me
 
[v2] 
 Your holy presence
 Surrounding me
 In every season
 I know you love me
 I know you love me
 
[c]
 At the cross I bow my knee
 Where your blood was shed for me
 There's no greater love than this
 You have overcome the grave
 Your glory fills the highest place
 What can separate me now?
 
[v3]
 You go before me
 You shield my way
 Your hand upholds me
 I know you love me
 I know you love me
 
[v4] 
 And when the earth fades
 Falls from my eyes
 And you stand before me
 I know you love me
 I know you love me
 
 
  
 You tore the veil
 You made a way
 When you said that it is done (repeat twice/fade)
