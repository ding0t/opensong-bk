  <title>Oh Happy Day</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 The greatest day in history
 Death is beaten, you have rescued me
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive!
 The empty cross, the empty grave
 Life eternal, you have won the day
 Shout it out, Jesus is alive
 He's alive!

[CH]
 And oh, happy day, happy day
 You washed my sin away
 Oh, happy day, happy day,
 I'll never be the same
 Forever I am changed

[V2]
 When I stand in that place
 Free at last, meeting face to face
 I am yours, Jesus you are mine
 Endless joy, perfect peace
 Earthly pain finally will cease
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive
 He's alive!

[B]
 Oh, what a glorious day
 What a glorious way
 That you have saved me!
 And oh, what a glorious day
 What a glorious name
 Hey-ey-ey-ey!</lyrics>
