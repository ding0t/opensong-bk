  <lyrics>[V1]
 0 worship the King
 All glorious above!
 0 gratefully sing
 His power and His love!
 Our shield and defender,
 The ancient of days,
 Pavilioned in splendour,
 And girded with praise...

[v2] 
 0 tell of His might,
 0 sing of His grace,
 Whose robe is the light,
 Whose canopy, space
 Whose chariot's of wrath
 The deep thunder-clouds form;
 And dark is His path
 On the wings of the storm...

[v3] 
 Your bountiful care
 What tongue can recite?
 It breathes in the air,
 It shines in the light,
 It streams from the hills,
 It descends to the plain
 And sweetly distils
 In the dew and the rain...
