  <lyrics>[v1]
 Thankyou for the cross,Lord
 Thankyou for the price You paid.
 Bearing all my sin and shame,
 In love You came and gave amazing grace.
[v2]
 Thankyou for this love,Lord.
 Thankyou for the nail-pierced hands.
 Washed me in your cleansing flow,
 Now all I know;
 Your forgiveness and embrace.
[c]
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Seated on the throne;
 Crown You now with many crowns.
 You reign victorious,
 High and lifted up,
 Jesus,Son of God.
 The darling of heaven crucified.
[c2]
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb.
 Thankyou for the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb,Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb.</lyrics></song>
