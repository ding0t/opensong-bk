[1]
 Like a river glorious is God&apos;s perfect peace
 Over all victorious in its bright increase
 Perfect, yet still flowing fuller every day
 Perfect, yet still growing deeper all the way
 
[C]
 Trusting in the Father
 Hearts are fully blessed
 Finding as he promised
 Perfect peace and rest
 
[2]
 Hidden in the hollow of his mighty hand
 Where no foe can follow, in his strength we stand
 We may trust him fully all for us to do
 Those who trust him wholly find him wholly true
