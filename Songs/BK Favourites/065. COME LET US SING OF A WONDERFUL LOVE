[1]
 Come let us sing of a wonderful love
 Tender and true
 Out of the heart of the Father above
 Streaming to me and to you
 Wonderful love
 Dwells in the heart of the Father above
 
[2]
 Jesus, the Saviour, this gospel to tell
 Joyfully came
 Came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell
 Sharing their sorrow and shame
 Seeking the lost
 Saving, redeeming at measureless cost

[3]
 Jesus is seeking the wanderers yet;
 Why do they roam?
 Love only waits to forgive and forget;
 Home! weary wanderer, home!
 Wonderful love
 Dwells in the heart of the Father above...
 
[4]
 Come to my heart, O thou wonderful love
 Come and abide
 Lifting my life till it rises above
 Envy and falsehood and pride
 Seeking to be
 Lowly and humble, a learner of thee
