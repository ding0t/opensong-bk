  <lyrics>[V1]
 My Saviour, Redeemer, 
 Lifted me from the miry clay.
 Almighty, forever,
 I will never be the same.
 Cause You came near
 from the everlasting
 to the world we live,
 the Father's only Son.
 
[C]
 And You lived and You died
 and You rose again on high.
 And You opened the way 
 for the world to live again.
 Hallelujah, for all You've done.
 Repeat
