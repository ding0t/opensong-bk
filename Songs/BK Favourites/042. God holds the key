  <lyrics>[V1]
 God holds the key
 Of all unknown
 And I am glad;
 If other hands should
 Hold the key,
 Or if He trusted it to me,
 I might be sad
 I might be sad...
 
[V2]
 What if to-morrows
 Cares were here
 Without its rest!
 I'd rather He
 Unlocked the day
 And, as the hours
 Swing open, say,
 "My will is best.
 My will is best."
 
[V3]
 Enough! this covers
 All my wants,
 And so I rest!
 For what I cannot,
 He can see
 And in His care
 I saved shall be,
 Forever blest.
 Forever blest   </lyrics>
