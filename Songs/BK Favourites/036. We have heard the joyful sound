  <lyrics>[V1]
 We have heard the joyful sound
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Tell the message all around
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Bear the news to every land
 Climb the steeps and cross the waves
 Onward! 'tis our Lord's command
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 
[v2]
 Waft it on the rolling tide
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Say to sinners far and wide,
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Sing, you islands ofthe sea,
 Echo back, you ocean caves;
 Earth shall keep her jubilee
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 
[v3]
 Give the winds a mighty voice
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Let the nations now rejoice -
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Shout salvation full and free
 To every strand that ocean laves;
 This our song of victory
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!   </lyrics></song>
