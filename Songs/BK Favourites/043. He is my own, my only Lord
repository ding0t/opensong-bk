  <lyrics>[V1]
 He is my own - my only Lord,
 The Lord I love forever,
 Though lords of other glories press
 And seek my soul to sever
 From Him who is my only Lord.
 Mine - who was once His mocker;
 My heart He caught at Calvary,
 Who took me to Golgotha....

[v2] 
 I heard the blood fall on the stones,
 I saw it's anguished splashing,
 My heart pained sore to see it pour,
 My eyes wept for His passion.
 This brilliant love caught all my heart
 Within His painful moaning
 I cried for sins that nailed Him there
 Tis darkness veiled His groaning...

[v3] 
 'Ah, Lord! I cried, 'How can You die
 VVhere I deserve that hanging?
 I saw them nail You to the Cross,
 I heard their hammers banging;
 Those nails went cleanly
 Through my sins,
 Those nails hold me forever;
 With You, my Lord, I'm crucified
 And nought can ever sever.'  

[V4]
 'My heart is caught into Your heart;
 I live because Your merit
 Cleansed every sin of mind and heart
 And purified my spirit.
 Now free I am - so free to love -
 Full free to tell the story,
 A holy priest, a joyous slave
 To cry Your endless glory...'

[v5] 
 Lords other than the Eternal Lord
 Are lords without true glory;
 They live in lies and die their death
 Without an endless story.
 But Christ our Lord abolished death
 And opened heaven's portals;
 He gives to us His own dear life
 That we may be immortal...
 
 |He is my own - my only Lord.   </lyrics></song>
