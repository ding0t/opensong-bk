[1]
 Have thine own way, Lord
 Have thine own way
 You are the Potter
 I am the clay
 Mould me and make me
 After thine will
 While I am waiting
 Yielded and still
 
[2]
 Have thine own way, Lord
 Have thine own way
 Search me and try me
 Master, today
 Whiter than snow, Lord
 Wash me just now
 As in thine presence
 Humbly I bow
 
[3]
 Have thine own way, Lord
 Have thine own way
 Wounded and weary
 Help me, I pray
 Thine have all power -
 Power divine -
 Touch me and heal me
 Saviour of mine!
 
[4]
 Have thine own way, Lord
 Have thine own way
 Hold o'er my being
 Absolute sway
 Fill with thine Spirit
 Till all shall see
 Christ only, always
 Living in me!
