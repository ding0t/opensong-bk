  <lyrics>[v1]
 We have raised our hopes
 and our cities high,
 we have followed fragile dreams,
 but only One could take the
 measure of our goals.
 And we've stumbled over
 the trials of life,
 and we've wrestled the unseen,
 but only One can calm the storm
 inside our souls.
[c]
 In the hands of God we will fall,
 rest for the restless,
 and the weary,
 hope for the sinner.
 In the hands of God
 we stand tall.
 Hands that are mighty
 to deliver,giving us freedom.
[v2]
 When our strength gave way
 to the weight of guilt,
 'til we strained for ev'ry breath,
 only One could lift our shame
 and make us well.
 And when all is finished 
 and we face the fearsome
 pow'r of death,
 only One has overcome
 the gates of hell.
[c2]
 You're amazing,
 You're amazing,You are.
 You,re amazing,
 You're amazing,You are.
 And we praise You,Lord,
 for what Your hands have done.
 You're amazing,
 You're amazing,You are.</lyrics></song>
