  <title>Man of Sorrows</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
 By his own betrayed,
 The sin of man and wrath of God
 Has been on Jesus laid.

[v2]
 Silent as He stood accused,
 Beaten mocked and scorned,
 Bowing to the Father's will,
 He took a crown of thorns.

[c]
 Oh that rugged cross my salvation,
 Where your love poured out over me,
 Now my soul cries out hallelujah,
 Praise and honour unto Thee.

[v3]
 Sent of heaven God's own Son,
 To purchase and redeem,
 And reconcile the very ones
 Who nailed Him to that tree.

[B]
 Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full,
 By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled,
 Now the curse of sin has no hold on me,
 Whom the Son sets free oh is free indeed.

[v4]
 See the stone is rolled away,
 Behold the empty tomb,
 Hallelujah, God be praised,
 He's risen from the grave.</lyrics>
