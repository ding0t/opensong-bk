  <lyrics>[V1]
 Everyone needs compassion
 Love that's never failing
 Let mercy fall on me
 Everyone needs forgiveness
 The kindness of a Saviour
 The hope of nations
 
[V2]
 So take me as you find me
 All my fears and failures
 Fill my life again
 I give my life to follow
 Everything I believe in
 Now I surrender
 
[c]
 Saviour, He can move the mountains
 My God is mighty to save
 He is mighty to save
 Fovever, Author of Salvation
 He rose and conquered the grave
 Jesus conquered the grave
 
[B]
 Shine your light and
 Let the whole world see
 We're singing
 For the glory
 Of the Risen King Jesus (repeat)
