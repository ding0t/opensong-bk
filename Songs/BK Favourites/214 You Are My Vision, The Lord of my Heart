  <title>214 You Are My Vision, The Lord of my Heart</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are my vision,the Lord of my heart.
 Naught be all else to me,save what you are.
 You my best thought,by day or by night.
 Waking or sleeping,your presence my light.
[V2]
 You are my wisdom,and you my true word.
 I'm ever with you,and you with me Lord.
 Your my great Father,and I your true son.
 You in me dwelling,and I with you one.
[V3]
 Riches I need not,nor man's empty praise.
 Your my inheritance now and always.
 You and you only, the first in my heart.
 High King of heaven,my treasure you are.
[V4]
 High King of heaven,my victory won.
 May I reach heavens joys,Oh bright heavens Son.
 Heart of my own heart,whatever befall.
 You are my vision,O ruler of all.</lyrics>
