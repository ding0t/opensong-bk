  <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, keep me near the Cross;
 There a precious fountain,
 Free to all - a living stream -
 Flows from Calvary's mountain...

[C]
 In the Cross, in the Cross,
 Be my glory ever;
 Till my raptured soul shall find
 Rest beyond the river.

[V2]
 Near the Cross, a trembling soul,
 Love and mercy found me;
 There the Bright and Morning Star
 Shed its beams around me...
 
[v3]
 Near the Cross! 0 Lamb of God,
 Bring its scenes before me;
 Help me walk from day to day,
 With its shadow o'er me...
 
[v4]
 Near the Cross I'll watch and wait,
 Hoping, trusting ever,
 Till I reach the golden strand,
 Just beyond the river...   </lyrics>
