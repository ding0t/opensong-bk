  <lyrics>[V1]
 The Church's one foundation
 Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
 She is His new creation
 By water and the Word;
 From heaven He came
 And sought her
 To be His holy Bride;
 With His own blood He bought her
 And for her life He died...
 Elect from every nation

[v2] 
 Yet one o'er all the earth,
 Her charter of salvation -
 One Lord, one faith, one birth;
 One holy name she blesses,
 Partakes one holy food;
 And to one hope she presses,
 With every grace endued...

[v3] 
 'Mid toil and tribulation,
 And tumults of her war,
 She waits the consummation
 Of peace for ever more.
 Till with the vision glorious
 Her longing eyes are blest,
 And the great Church victorious
 Shall be the Church at rest...   </lyrics></song>
