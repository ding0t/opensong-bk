  <lyrics>[v1]
 Would you be free from the burden of sin?
 There's power in the blood,power in the blood;
 Would you o'er evil a victory win?
 There's wonderful power in the blood.
[c]
 There is power,power,wonder working pow'r
 In the blood of the Lamb.
 There is power,power,wonder working pow'r
 In the precious blood of the Lamb.
[v2]
 Would you be free from your passion and pride?
 There's power in the blood,power in the blood;
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide;
 There's wonderful power in the blood.
 
[v3]
 Would you be whiter,much whiter than snow?
 There's power in the blood,power in the blood;
 Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow;
 There's wonderful power in the blood.
 
[v4]
 Would you do service for Jesus your King?
 There's power in the blood,power in the blood;
 Would you live daily His praises to sing?
 There's wonderful power in the blood.
