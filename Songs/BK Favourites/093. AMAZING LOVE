[1]
 My Lord, what love is this
 That pays so dearly
 That I, the guilty one
 May go free?
 
[C]
 Amazing love! O what sacrifice
 The Son of God giv'n for me
 My debt he pays and my death he dies
 That I might live [2x]
 
[2]
 And so they watched him die
 Despised, rejected
 But O the blood he shed
 Flowed for me!
 
[3]
 And now this love of Christ
 Shall flow like rivers
 Come, wash your guilt away
 Live again!
