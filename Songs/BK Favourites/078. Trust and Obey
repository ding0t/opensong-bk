  <lyrics>[V1]
 When we walk with the Lord
 In the light of His Word,
 What a glory He sheds on our way!
 While we do His good will,
 He abides with us still,
 And with all who will trust and obey.

[C]
 Trust and obey, for there's no other way
 To be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.

[V2]
 Not a shadow can rise,
 Not a cloud in the skies,
 But His smile quickly drives it away;
 Not a doubt nor a fear,
 Not a sigh nor a tear,
 Can abide while we trust and obey....

[V3]
 But we never can prove
 The delights of His love,
 Until all on the altar we lay;
 For the favour He shows,
 And the joy He bestows,
 Are for them who will trust and obey......

[V4]
 Then in fellowship sweet
 We will sit at His feet
 Or we'll walk by His side in the way,
 What He says we will do,
 Where He sends we will go,
 Never fear, only trust and obey.......
