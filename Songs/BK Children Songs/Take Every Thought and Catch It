 Take every thought and catch it (gotcha)
 Chuck out all of that sin (bye bye)
 Take every thought and catch it
 And think about J-E-S-U-S
 And fix your thoughts on Him
 
[V1]
 Gotta chuck out envy
 No room for greed
 Cos God has blessed you
 With all you need.... (so)
 
 
[V2]
 Gotta chuck out hatred
 And bitterness
 Gotta repent
 Change your mind
 And confess... (and)
 
 
[V3]
 Whatever is noble
 Pure and true
 Think on all
 God's done for you... (and)
