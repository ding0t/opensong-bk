[v1]
 The Wise Man Built his house upon the rock
 The Wise Man Built his house upon the rock
 The Wise Man Built his house upon the rock
 and the rain came tumbling down
 
[v2]
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 and the house on the rock stood firm
 
[v3]
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 and the rain came tumbling down
 
[v4]
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 and the house on the sand went splat
 
[v5]
 So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
 So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
 So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
 and through the storms you will stand
