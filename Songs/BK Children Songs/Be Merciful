  <lyrics>[V1]
 Listen What Jesus say
 For His commands are these:
 Do good to those who hate you,
 Love your enemies.
[V2]
 Oh-oh-oh-oh be merciful
 Just as your God is merciful
 Oh-oh-oh-oh be merciful
 This is the way of love.
[V3]
 Never put others down.
 Better you forgive
 You will not be put down, and 
 You will be forgiv'n
[V4]
 Sometimes in someone's eye
 You're quick to see a speck,
 Could be a log in yours so,
 First you better check!
[V5]
 Give and you will receive,
 Great will be your reward.
 If you believe in me, you'll
 Be a child of God.</lyrics></song>
