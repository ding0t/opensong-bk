[V1]
 There's an old black crow
 Sitting in the gum tree
 He's plump and he's well fed
 A beetle here, a cicada there
 Is the black crow's daily bread
 I think it should be said
 
[C]
 There's a Lord who cares
 For the old black crow
 The wombat, the gecko and the kangaroo
 And one thing's sure we are worth much more
 To the God who cares for people too.
 
[V2]
 Mrs Wombat digs herself a little burrow
 To keep her warm and dry.
 It's her home sweet home that she's made her own.
 Better than money can buy.
 And here's the reason why...
 
[C]
 
 
[V3]
 The gecko lives in the sands of the desert
 Where it's very dry and hot
 He's small and frail 
 With a stumpy tail
 But hungry he is not,cos
 All he needs he's got....
 
[V4]
 
 The Lord cares too for the kangaroo
 I think it could be true
 That worth much more to the Lord above 
 Are You and YOU and YOU (point to friends)
 And YOU and YOU and YOU!</lyrics></song>
