  <lyrics>[v1]
 If I were a butterfly
 I'd thank you, Lord, for giving me wings
 And if I were a robin in a tree
 I'd thank you, Lord, that I could sing
 And if I were a fish in the sea
 I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee
 But I just thank you, Father
 For making me 'me'

[c]
 For you gave me a heart, and you gave me a smile
 You gave me Jesus and you made me your child
 And I just thank you, Father, for making me 'me'

[v2]
 If I were an elephant
 I'd thank you, Lord, by raising my trunk
 And if I were a kangaroo
 You know I'd hop right up to you
 And if I were an octopus
 I'd thank you, Lord, for my fine looks
 But I just thank you, Father
 For making me 'me'

[v3]
 If I were a giggly worm
 I'd thank you, Lord, that I could squirm
 And if I were a fuzzy-wuzzy bear
 I'd thank you, Lord, for my fuzzy-wuzzy hair
 And if I were a crocodile
 I'd thank you, Lord, for my great smile
 But I just thank you, Father
 For making me 'me'</lyrics></song>
