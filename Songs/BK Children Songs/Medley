  <lyrics>[V1]

 Behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us
 behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us
 That we should be called the sons of God
 That we should be called the sons of God

[V2]
 My Lord loves me and oh the wonder I see
 His cross love shine all around me
 my Lord loves me

[V3]
 God forgave my sin in Jesus name, 
 I've been born again in Jesus name
 and in Jesus name I come to you, 
 to share His love as he told me to

[V4]
 He said Freely, freely you have received,freely, freely give.
 Go in my name and because you believe, others will know that I live.

[V5]
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
 Because He lives, all fear is gone
 Because I know He holds the future 
 and life is worth the living just because He lives

[V6]
 Joyful, joyful we adore thee, God of glory Lord of love
 Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, hail Thee as the sun above
 Melt the cloud of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away
 giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.

[V7]
 How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
 that He should give His only Son to make a wretch His treasure.
 How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turns His face away.
 as wounds which mar the chosen one, brings many Sons to glory

[V8]
 Come and behold Him, come and behold Him
 Come with an honest heart to see all He is
 Come and behold Him, wait now before Him,
 come with an honest heart to see all He is.

[V9]
 Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
 how precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.

[V10]
 Praise God, praise God,Praise God, praise God,
 Praise God, praise God, Praise God, praise God,
 Praise God, praise God, Praise God, praise God,
 Praise God, praise God, Praise God, praise God,
