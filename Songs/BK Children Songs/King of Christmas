[V1]
 Let the Chrismas tree remind you of
 The one who trusts the Lord
 Who walks the path of godliness
 And loves to hear God's word
 Pray that as you grow up
 That's how you will be
 Standing tall for Jesus
 Like the Christmas tree
 
[C]
 
 
 Let your love show HO!Ho!
 Let your faith grow ho!ho!
 That everyone will know
 Christ the King of Christmas
 
 
[V2]
 Well let the fairy lights remind you
 Of that bright and shining star
 Spotted by the wise men who travelled from afar
 They gave Jesus all their treasures
 And they worshipped him that night
 Let your worship of King Jesus shine like fairy lights
 
[V3]
 
 Well let the candy cane remind you 
 Of God's amazing grace
 Red- the blood of Jesus
 As he suffered in our place
 White- the full forgiveness
 Won as Jesus rose again
 You can tell your friends the gospel
 With a candy cane
 
 
[V4]
 Well let all the gifts at Christmas time
 Fill your heart with praise
 To God for all his goodness
 Shown in O so many ways
 That everyday in everyway
 We'd be completely his
 Give your life to Jesus as a 
 Christmas gift.
