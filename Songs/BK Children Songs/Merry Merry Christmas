[C]
 
 
 Merry merry Christmas
 Come and find forgiveness
 Jesus Christ the King is born (repeat all)
 
[V1]
 
 More than Christmas trees
 More than families
 More than presents
 We need Jesus
 More than decorations
 More than celebrations
 Hope for all the nations
 We need Jesus
 
[V2]
 
 More than Christmas lights
 More than carol nights
 More than good times
 We need Jesus
 He came to save the lost
 His life is what it cost
 Everyone of us
 We need Jesus</lyrics></song>
