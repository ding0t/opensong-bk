[V1]
 Jesus is the Saviour who I love to know
 Heaven is the place that I'm going to
 Jesus is the captain who now leads my life
 Unworthy as I am, I know he came to save
 A sinner such as me, a sinner such as you
 He came to save, us from the grave.
 
 
[C]
 
 
 For God so loved the world that He gave
 His one and only Son
 That whosoever believes in him
 Should not perish but have everlasting life</lyrics></song>
