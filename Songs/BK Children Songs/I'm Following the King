 I'm following the King! 
 I'm ready to obey
 To listen to His Word
 Yes, Jesus is my King!
 I'm living now for him
 Cos Jesus is my King.
[V1]
 I don't deserve his mercy
 I don't deserve his love
 And yet he died to save me
 Died upon the cross!
[Coda]
 Jesus is my...
 Jesus is my...
 Jesus is my.... KING!</lyrics></song>
