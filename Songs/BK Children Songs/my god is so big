[C]
 My God is so BIG
 So strong and so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do
 Thats true!
 
 My God is so BIG
 So strong and so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do
 That's true!
 
 The mountains are his 
 The valleys are his
 The stars are his handiwork, too
 
 My God is so BIG
 So Strong and so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do
 Thats true!
