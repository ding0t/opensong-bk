  <lyrics>[v1] 
 The world belongs to God
 He spoke and there it was
 Though it was very good
 It all went bad because,
 The man that God had made
 And the woman there with him
 Turned their back on God to get
 A deadly taste of sin  (BUT...)
 
[c]
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! Jesus is the Way
 Jesus is the Saviour
 You can come to Him today - Hey!
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 People from their sin
 You will find forgiveness 
 When you put your trust in Him
 
[v2]
 Well if you look around
 You'll see how sin has spread
 Turning light to dark
 And living things to dead
 But God still rules the world
 He always had a plan
 To send his son to save us
 In the likeness of a man
 
[v3]
 Well if you come to God
 (You still have time you know)
 He'll wash your sinful heart
 And make it white as snow
 Come taste eternal life
 And death will have no sting
 All who trust in Jesus are 
 The children of the King
