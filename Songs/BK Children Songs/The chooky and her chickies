  <lyrics>[1]
 I love my little farmhouse
 There’s a horsey in the paddock
 Moo cows by the fences
 A rabbit in the hutch
 But look at all those chickies
 Cuddling to their mummy
 That mummy chicky loves her little
 Chickies very much

[C]
 God loves his children like the chooky
 loves her chickies
 The mother hen will gather them
 Underneath her wing
 God loves his children like the chooky
 loves her chickies
 The mother hen will gather them
 Underneath her wing

[B]
 And she goes
 buck buck buck
 buck buck buck
 buck buck buck buck buck
 buk-air!
 
[2]
 In the barn I keep my tractor
 On the pond there’s often duckies
 I whistle to my puppy
 Ooo just watch my puppy run!
 And see the little chickies
 When they think there might be danger
 Mother chicken cluckies
 And then her wee chickies come 

[3]
 So when you’re sad or sorry
 When you’re scared or when you worry
 I suggest you hurry
 To the shelter of God’s wing…
