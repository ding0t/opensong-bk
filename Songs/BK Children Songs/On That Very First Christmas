  <lyrics>[V1]
 Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem
   Bethlehem, Bethlehem,
   Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem
   On that very first Christmas
 
[V2]
 Baby Jesus born that night, born that night
   born that night,
   Baby Jesus born that night
   On that very first Christmas
 
[V3]
 The wise men come to worship him, worship him,
   worship him.
   The wise men come to worship him
   On that very first Christmas.
 
[V4]
 The shepherds told that the King is born
   The King is born
   The King is born
   The shepherds told that the King is born
   On that very first Christmas
 
[V5]
 The angels singing glory to God
   Glory to God, Glory to God
   The angels singing glory to God
   On that very first Christmas
 
[C]
 Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem
   Baby Jesus born that night
   The wise men come to worship him
   The shepherds told that the King is born
   The Angels singing glory to God
   On that very first Christmas.
