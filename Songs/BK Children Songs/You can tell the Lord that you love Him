[C]
 You can tell the Lord that you love Him anytime
 You can tell the Lord that you need Him anytime
 Thank Him for His love and care
 Shoot Him up an arrow prayer
 You can tell the Lord that you love Him anytime.
 
[1]
 In the middle of whatever you’re doin’ at school
 At lunch when you’re kickin’ the ball
 When you’re chasin’ your mates all over the place
 You can talk to the Lord of all.
 
[2]
 When you’re happy as Larry, when you’re full of joy
 When you’re blown out by the view
 Give thanks to the God who’s showered His blessings
 Showered His blessings on you, and you, and you, and…
 
[b] 
 You can tell the Lord that you love Him anytime
 You can tell the Lord that you need Him anytime
 Thank Him for His love and care
 Shoot Him up an arrow prayer
[b1]
 You can tell the Lord that you love Him,
 You can tell the Lord that you need Him
 You can tell the Lord that you love Him anytime
