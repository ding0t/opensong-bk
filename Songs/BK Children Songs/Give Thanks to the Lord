  <lyrics>[C]
 
 
 Give thanks to the Lord for he is good
 Give thanks to the Lord forever.
 Give thanks to the Lord for he is good.
 
 
[V1]
 When you jump out of bed and you touch your toes
 When you brush your teeth and put on your clothes.
 
 
 
 
[V2]
 When you eat your dinner and you're all full up
 When your Mum says "_________(own name)"
 Will you help wash up?
 
 
[V3]
 
 When you stretch up high 
 And you touch the ground
 When you stretch out wide
 And you turn around.
 
 
[V4]
 
 When you click your fingers
 And you stamp your feet.
 When you clap your hands
 And you slap your knees
