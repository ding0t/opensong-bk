  <title>Broken Vessels</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
  All these pieces broken and scattered
 In mercy gathered mended and whole
 Empty handed but not forsaken
 I've been set free, I've been set free

 
[V2]
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 Oh I once was lost but now I am found
 Was blind but now I see

 
[c]
 Oh I can see You now
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
 Laying Yourself down 
 Raising up the broken to life

 
[V3]
 You take our failure, You take our weakness
 You set Your treasure in jars of clay
 So take this heart Lord, I'll be Your vessel
 The world to see Your life in me oh
