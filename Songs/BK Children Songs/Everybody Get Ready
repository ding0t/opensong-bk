[C]
 
 Everybody get ready (echo)
 Get ready for the Lord (echo)
 Get Ready (echo)
 Get set (echo)
 And Go (echo)
 
 
[V1]
 God had a great plan
 His Son becomes a man
 The sacrificial Lamb
 To take away the sin of the world
 
 
[V2]
 Wise men and shepherds come
 To see the promised One
 Praise God for what he's done
 It's Jesus the King of the world
 
 
[V3]
 His life was free from blame
 He bore our sin and shame
 He's coming back again
 To show that he's the King of the world</lyrics></song>
