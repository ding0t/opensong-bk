 AARRRRR... you...
 Serving Cap'n Jesus?
 He's the Master of the wind and waves
 There's Yo HO HO no other name
 By which you can be saved
 Through scurvy, shark and shipwreck
 In every storm and stife
 Sail on with Cap'n Jesus
 As the treasure of your life
 
 
[V1]
 
 Climb the rigging   Aye aye Cap'n
 
 Swab the deck!  Aye aye Cap'n
 
 Row the longboat!  Aye aye Cap'n
 
 And dance the hornpipe now....!!
 
 Heave away! Haul away!
 Heave away! Haul away!
 Land ho!Land ho! Land ho! Land HO!
