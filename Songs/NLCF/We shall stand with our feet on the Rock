  <lyrics>;INTRO.    E    G#m  A    B ...

[C]
.         E              C#m 
 We shall stand with our feet on the Rock 
.         A
 Whatever men may say
.B                         E   B ...
 We'll lifted Your name on high
.             E                C#m 
 And we shall walk through the darkest night
.            A
 Setting our faces like flint
.B                   E
 We'll walk into the light

[V1]
.G#m           A             E
 Lord You have chosen me for fruitfulness 
.G#m        A                E   B 
 To be transformed into Your likeness 
.          C#m
 I'm gonna fight on through
.      A         B            B...
 'Till I see You face to face

[V2]
 Lord as Your witnesses You've appointed us
 And with Your Holy Spirit, anointed us
 And so l'll fight on through
 'Till I see you face to face

[B]
.         E    G#m        A    B 
 We shall stand, we shall stand, 
.         E    G#m        A    B
 We shall stand, we shall stand, 
.         E
 We shall stand</lyrics></song>
