.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You
.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You

[C]
.          C        G         D            C G  D
 Who could stand if sins were known, and recorded

[V2]
.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You
.Em                       A               D
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You, for mercy
