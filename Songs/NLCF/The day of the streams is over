.F               
 The day of the streams is over
.C                        F
 The time of the river is here    x2

[V1]
.C                     Bb     F
 I hear the sound of a mighty river,
.           Bb  Dm7        C
 Of rushing water, running free
.C                      Bb    F
 To every land, through every border,
.        Bb Gm7          C
 Flowing now across this earth.

[V2]
 There is a time I know is coming,
 When all God's people join as one;
 They will become a great awakening,
 Bringing life to all the world.

[B]
.        F 
 And the river is flowing, getting wider and wider,
.F
 Deeper and deeper as it flows from the throne;
.        F
 And the leaves on the trees are for the healing of the nations,
.        F
 It's as clear as crystal, it's the water of life.</lyrics></song>
