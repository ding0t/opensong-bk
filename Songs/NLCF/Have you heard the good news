  <lyrics>;INTRO     F    Dm   x4

[C]
.         F              Dm
 Have you heard the good news?
.         F              Dm
 Have you heard the good news?
.F/A            C
 We can live in hope 
.           Bb       C        F
 Because of what the Lord has done       x2

[V1]
.Gm         Dm             C              F
 There is a way when there seems no other way
.Gm         Dm           F/C  C
 There is a light in the darkness
.Gm         Dm       C           F
 There is a hope, an everlasting hope
.Gm         Bb          C9   C
 There is a God who can help us

[V2]
 A hope for justice and a hope for peace
 A hope for those in desperation
 We have a future if only we believe
 He works in every situation</lyrics></song>
