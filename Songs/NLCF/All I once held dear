.C  G/B Am  F    C              F    G C
 All I once held dear, built my life upon
.C   G/B  Am    F C         Am      G
 All this world reveres and wars to own
.C     F    G       C    C/E    F   G   Am/C
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss
.C     G/B Am   F    C      Am       Gsus4  G
 Spent and worthless now compared to this

[C]
.        F    C      F/G  G  C  G/B
 Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You
.      Am    Em/G    F
 There is no greater thing
.          C/E             F/A
 You're my all, You're the best
.          C/G              F/A
 You're my joy, my righteousness
.      C/E      F/A   C/G   G
 And I love You Lord

[V2]
 Now my heart's desire is to know You more
 To be found in You and known as Yours
 To possess by faith what I could not earn
 All surpassing gift of righteousness

[V3]
 Oh to know the power of Your risen life
 And to know You in Your sufferings
 To become like You in Your death my Lord
 So with You to live and never die</lyrics></song>
