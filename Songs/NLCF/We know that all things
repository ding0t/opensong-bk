.E            F#m               E              F#m
 We know that all things work together for our good
.    E                 F#m B7    E    B7
 For good to those who love  the Lord
.E           F#m          E                F#m
 For God has called us to be just like His Son
.   E             F#m       B7     E   B7
 To live and walk according to His Word

.E      B7        F#m   B7
 We are more than conquerers
.E      B7        F#m   B7
 We are more than conquerers
.E      B7        F#m   B7
 We are more than conquerers
.        E B7 F#m B7         E B7 F#m B7
 Through Christ, ____ through Christ

[V2]
 I am persuaded that neither death nor life
 Nor angels, principalities or powers
 Nor things that are now, nor things that are to come
 Can separate us from the love of Christ

[V3]
 If God is for us, who against us can prevail
 No one can bring a charge against His chosen ones
 And there will be no separation from our Lord
 He has justified us through His precious blood</lyrics></song>
