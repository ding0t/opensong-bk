  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                                   F/A      
 Did you feel the mountains tremble,|Did you hear the oceans roar
.F/D                             F/A              Gsus4 C 
 When the people rose to sing of|Jesus Christ the risen One? 

[V2]
 Did you feel the people tremble,|Did you hear the singers roar
 When the lost began to sing of|Jesus Christ the saving One?
 
[P1]
.           F/A                 C
 And we can see that God You're moving
.         F/A               C
 A mighty river through the nations
.              F/A              C
 And young and old will turn to Jesus
.F/D            
 Fling wide you heavenly gates
.F                      Gsus4 C    G
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord

[C]
.C                     F/A
 Open up the doors and let the music play
.F/D                          C      G
 Let the streets resound with singing
.C                           F/A
 Songs that bring Your hope, songs that bring Your joy
.F/D                      C      G
 Dancers who dance upon injustice

[V3]
 Do you feel the darkness tremble|When all saints join in one song
 And all the streams flow as one river|To wash away our brokenness
    
[P2] 
 And here we see that God You're moving
 A time of jubilee is coming
 When young and old return to Jesus
 Fling wide you heavenly gates
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord</lyrics>
