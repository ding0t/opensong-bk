  <lyrics>;INTRO     A    E/G#   A/F#    E    Bm    A/C#    D     E       (A)

[V1]
.A                    E/G#    E7                         A
 I was lost without a trace, |all except for the eyes of heaven
.A7                        D        A/C# Bm      E/G#                D/A  A
 Now my Saviour’s love has found me     |and His love has brought me home

[V2]
.A                    E/G#      E7                    A
 I can sleep in peace tonight, |I won’t worry about tomorrow
.A7                  D         A/C# Bm          E/G#              D/A  A
 Now I know my Daddy loves me,     |His perfect love will conquer all

[C]
.           E                      D               A
 I’m like a child in His eyes |and He will meet my needs
.A7                     D
 With all the riches of heaven
.D/F#                     A               E
 And He loves me much too much |to let me go
.                       D    A      (INTRO BETWEEN VERSES)
 He will keep me in His love

[V3]
.A                         E/G#   E7                      A
 Heaven and earth may pass away, |mountains fall into the oceans
.A7                  D        A/C# Bm      E/G#             D/A  A
 But His word is everlasting,     |and His love goes on and on</lyrics>
