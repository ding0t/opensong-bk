.A                   
 I can feel You, flowing through me
.                              E  D                 A
 Holy Spirit, come and fill me up, come and fill me up.
.A
 Love and mercy fill my senses,
.                               E   D                  A
 I am thirsty for Your presence Lord, come and fill me up.

[C]
.Bm            E          A               F#m
 Lord let Your mercy wash away, all of my sin.
.Bm          E                A          F#m    E
 Fill me completely with Your love, once again.
.D           A/C#        Bm          F#m7/E   E
 I need You, I want You, I love Your presence.
.D           A/C#        Bm          F#m7/E   E
 I need You, I want You, I love Your presence.</lyrics></song>
