  <lyrics>[V1]
.C      Dm7  C/E F C/E  G       G7/B  C
 Filled with compassion for all creation,
.C Dm7 C/E  F C/E                 G
 Jesus came into a world that was lost.
.C     Dm7 C/E F   C/E G             G7/B C
 There was but one way that He could save us
.C Dm7 C/E     F  C/E    G          C    Dm7 C/E
 Only  through suffering death on a cross.
        
[C]
.F            C/E      G             Dm7 C
 God, You are waiting, Your heart is breaking
.F           C/E        D/F#        G
 For all the people who live on the earth.
.F          C/E     G                Dm7   C
 Stir us to action, filled with Your passion
.F           C/E        G           C
 For all the people who live on the earth.

[V2]
 Great is Your passion for all the people
 Living and dying without knowing You.
 Having no Saviour, they're lost forever,
 If we don't speak out and lead them to You

[V3]
 From every nation we shall be gathered,
 Millions redeemed shall be Jesus' reward.
 Then He will turn and say to His Father:
 "Surely my suffering was worth it all."</lyrics></song>
