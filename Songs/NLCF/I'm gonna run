.          G
 I'm gonna run, run, run to meet my Jesus
.          D                        G
 I'm gonna run, run, run to meet my Jesus
.          G                        Em
 I'm gonna run, run, run to meet my Jesus
.        Am    D        G  C  G  D
 When He comes, when He comes

[V1]
.      G
 Every eye, shall behold Him
.      D            G
 Every eye, shall behold Him
.      G                 Em
 Every eye, shall behold Him
.        Am   D         G  C  G  D
 When He comes, when He comes

 Every tongue shall confess Him 
 Every tongue shall confess Him 
 Every tongue shall confess Him 
 When He comes, when He comes

[V3]
 Every knee shall bow before Him
 Every knee shall bow before Him
 Every knee shall bow before Him
 When He comes, when He comes</lyrics></song>
