.G2                D/F#
 Love everlasting, love without measure,
.Em7                 D       
 Full of compassion, righteous and pure;
.C     G/B             Am7   C/D      D
 Is my Saviour's love, is my Father's heart.

[V2]
.G2                   D/F#
 Loved by the Father, saved by the Son,
.Em7                 D           
 Born of His Spirit, washed in the blood;
.C          G/B             Am7        C/D      D
 This is my Saviour's love, this is my Father's heart.

[B]
.Em            Cmaj7 Em                Cmaj7
 Your love for me,   it reaches to the heavens,
.Em              Cmaj7             Bm7
 Let my love for You just grow and grow !    
.Em            Cmaj7 Em                Cmaj7
 Your love for me,   it reaches to the heavens,
.Em              Cmaj7             D  D/F#
 Let my love for You just grow and grow !    

[V3]
.G2                       D/F#
 Love sent from heaven, received in our hearts,
.Em7                      D               
 Loving each other, since Christ first loved us;
.C          G/B             Am7        C/D      D  
 Sharing my Saviour's love, showing my Father's heart.</lyrics></song>
