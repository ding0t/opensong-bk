.E      B7 A E    C#m         A      B7
 Christ is risen, hallelujah, hallelujah
.E      B7 A E    C#m     A          B7 E
 Christ is risen, risen indeed, hallelujah

[V1]
.A              E/G#      A         E/G#
 Love's work is done, the battle is won
.A           B7            E
 Where now O death is your sting
.G       C/G       G           C/G
 He rose again, to rule and to reign
.G          F#m        A/B    B
 Jesus, our conquering King

[V2]
 Lord over sin, Lord over death
 At His feet Satan must fall
 Every knee bow, all will confess
 Jesus is Lord over all

[V3]
 Tell it abroad, 'Jesus is Lord'
 Shout it and let your praise ring
 Gladly we raise, our songs of praise
 Worship is our offering
