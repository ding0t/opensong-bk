.E              
 Bind us together Lord, bind us together     
.     B7                   E
 With cords that cannot be broken
.E                        
 Bind us together Lord, bind us together
.F#m       B7          E   A   E   B7
 Bind us together with love

[V1]
.E        A        E 
 There is only one God  
.E        B7       E 
 There is only one King
.E        A        E
 There is only one Body  
.E       B7     E    B7
 That is why we sing

[V2]
 Made for the glory of God  
 Purchased by His precious Son
 Born with the right to be clean    
 For Jesus the victory has won

[V3]
 You are the family of God
 You are the promise divine
 You are God's chosen desire
 You are the glorious new wine</lyrics></song>
