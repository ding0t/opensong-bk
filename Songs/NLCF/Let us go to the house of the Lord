.       D
 Let us go, to the house, of the Lord
.       D                             Esus4 E C/A C/D
 Let us go, to the house, of the Lord

[V1]
.    G                     Bm
 I rejoiced with those who said to me
.        C                      G
 'Let us go to the house of the Lord'
.    G                 Bm              Dsus4  D
 Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem 
.       G    Bm      Em
 Like a city built together
.          C                G
 Where the people of God go up
.   Am         D           G
 To praise the name of the Lord

[V2]
 For peace for our Jerusalem
 And loved ones this we pray
 May all men be secure where they must live
 And to all my friends and brothers
 May the peace be within you
 For the sake of the House of the Lord
