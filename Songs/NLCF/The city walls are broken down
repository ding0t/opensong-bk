.    D            
 The city walls are broken down, 
.A7           D   
 Broken down, broken down,
.    D                           Em7  A7  D
 The city walls are broken down, call Nehemiah.

[V2]
 Nehemiah cried and prayed, 
 Cried and prayed, cried and prayed,
 Nehemiah cried and prayed, 'Lord, please help me.'

[V3]
 God will tell you what to do,
 What to do, what to do, 
 God will tell you what to do Nehemiah.

[V4]
 Build those walls back up again, 
 Up again, up again,
 Build those walls back up again Nehemiah.

[V5]
 Lots of people helped to build,
 Helped to build, helped to build,
 Lots of people helped to build the wall round the city.

[V6]
 But other people called them names, 
 Called them names, called them names,
 But other people called them names   they went on building.

[V7]
 The guards were watching day and night,
 Day and night, day and night,
 The guards were watching day and night, the Lord stayed with them.

[V8]
 Nehemiah prayed to God,
 Prayed to God, prayed to God,
 Nehemiah prayed to God, all the wall was finished.</lyrics></song>
