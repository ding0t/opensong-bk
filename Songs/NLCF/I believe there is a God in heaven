.Em                   D
 I believe there is a God in heaven
.    C                         Em/B
 Who paid the price for all my sin
.Em                     D
 Shed His blood to open up the way
.    C          C/D  Em  Em/F#
 For me to walk with Him

[C]
.G                    D/F#
 Gave His life upon a cross
.C/E                     Em/C Em/D
 Took the punishment for us
.G                     D/F#  C      D
 Offered up Himself in love, Jesus, Jesus
.G                        D/F#
 'It is finished' was His cry
.    C/E                  Em/C  Em/D
 Not even death could now deny
.    G                  D/F#  C      D      B7
 The Son of God exalted high, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus</lyrics></song>
