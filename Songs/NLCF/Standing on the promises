  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                             
 Standing on the promises of Christ our King
.D                            A
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring
.A
 Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
.A               E           A D A E
 Standing on the promises of God

[C]
.A   A7    D   Bm
 Standing, standing
.E                           A       E
 Standing on the promises of God, my Saviour
.A   A7    D   Bm
 Standing, standing
.    A               E           A  D  A  E
 I'm standing on the promises of God

[V2]
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail
 I'm standing on the promises of God

[V3]
 Standing on the promises I now can see
 Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free
 Standing on the promises of God

[V4]
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord
 Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword
 Standing on the promises of God</lyrics>
