.C                    G/C C  Dm7                  Gsus4 G
 Only by grace can we enter, only by grace can we stand
.C                   G/C C   Dm7                     Gsus4 G
 Not by our human endeavour, but by the blood of the Lamb
.Em7                    G/A  Am      Fmaj7      Gsus4 G
 Into Your presence You call us, You call us to come
.C                      G/A  Am7     Dm7         F/G   G  C    Am7
 Into Your presence You draw us, and now by Your grace we come
.Dm7         F/G   G  C    G/B
 Now by Your grace we come

 Lord, if You mark our transgressions

 By the blood of the Lamb
.Am           Am/G          F 
 Lord, if You mark our transgressions

 Who will stand
