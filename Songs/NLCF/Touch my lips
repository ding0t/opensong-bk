.E        A         B    E                     A        B 
 Touch my lips with holy fire, from the altar, from the throne.
.E        A     B      C#m   A      B        E  A    B
 Touch my lips, purify them, may my words be as Your own.
.E        A         B    E                     A        B
 Touch my lips with holy fire, from the altar, from the throne.
.E        A     B      C#m   A      B        E
 Touch my lips, purify them, may my words be as Your own.

.            F#m           A/B        B/E  E
 Always life giving, thanksgiving, forgiving,
.         F#m         A/B      B/E     E 
 Always believing and speaking what is good;
.           G#m           C#m        F#m       B
 And always honouring, preferring in love each other,
.           F#m               B                    A/C#   B/Eb
 Love never boasts, it always covers; touch my lips.</lyrics></song>
