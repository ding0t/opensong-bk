  <lyrics>[V1]
.G       C       G            C/G   G
 At Your feet we fall, mighty risen Lord
.G     C/G    G        C/G        G       C   E7  Am 
 As we come before Your throne to worship You
.E7     Am       E7  Am E7      Am       E7   Am
 By the Spirit's power, You now draw our hearts
.       D                  D7              G   C   G
 And we hear Your voice in triumph ringing clear

[C]
.G            Em           A7             D
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead
.  G     G/F  C/E  Eb7 G/D  D  G
 Behold I am alive for evermore

[V2]
 There we see You stand, mighty risen Lord
 Clothed in garments pure and holy, shining bright
 Eyes of flashing fire, feet like burnished bronze
 And the sound of many waters is Your voice

[V3]
 Like the shining sun in its noonday strength
 We now see the glory of Your wondrous face
 Once that face was marred, but now You're glorified
 And Your words like a two edged sword have mighty power</lyrics></song>
