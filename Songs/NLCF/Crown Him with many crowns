  <lyrics>[V1]
.C              Am    F         C     F   C   G
 Crown Him with many crowns the Lamb upon His throne
.     C                D      G          C     D       G
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own
.C                 F       D                G 
 Awake my soul and sing of Him who died for me
.    C               G      C            F    G    C
 And hail Him as Thy chosen King through all eternity

[V2]
 Crown Him the Son of God before the worlds began
 And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man
 Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast
 And takes and bears them for His own that all in Him may rest

[V3]
 Crown Him, The Lord of life who triumphed o'er the grave
 And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save
 His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high
 Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die

[V4]
 Crown Him the Lord of heaven, enthroned in worlds above
 Crown Him the King to whom is given the wondrous name of love
 All Hail Redeemer hail, for Thou hast died for me
 Thy praise shall never never fail throughout eternity</lyrics>
