.Em7    Am9       D          B7            C
 Come O Spirit of God, cause blind eyes to see
.        G/B   Am7       Dsus4   D
 In this day, awaken our land
.Em7    Am9       D             B7                C
 Come O Spirit of power breathe life through Your church
.       G           Cm7 F/C   G
 Come O Lord, bring heaven to earth
.      Cm7 F/C   G
 Bring heaven to earth

[V1]
.Cm7      Cm9                  G
 In every house where there is sorrow
.Ebmaj7          Dm7               G
 Reaching out to comfort those who mourn
.Cm7       Cm9             G
 Declaring freedom for the captives
.Eb                 C             Dsus4   D
 We'll proclaim the favour of the Lord

[V2]
 In every town across this nation
 Reaching out to heal the broken hearts
 Releasing prisoners from the darkness
 We'll proclaim the justice of our God

[V3]
 In city streets weighed down by heartache
 Reaching out with grace where there is shame
 Once shattered lives restored to wholeness
 We'll display the splendour of the Lord</lyrics></song>
