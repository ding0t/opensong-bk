.D                G       A  D
 O for a thousand tongues to sing
.   Em               A          D       E        A 
 My great Redeemer's praise,|My great Redeemer's praise
.D                 G       A
 The glories of my God and King
.    D               G          D               A
 The triumphs of His grace, the triumphs of His grace
.    D               G                   A      D  
 The triumphs of His grace, the triumphs of His grace

[V2]
 Jesus the name that charms our fears
 That bids our sorrows cease, that bids our sorrows cease
 Tis music in the sinner's ear
 Tis life and health and peace, tis life and health and peace
 Tis life and health and peace, tis life and health and peace

[V3]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin
 He sets the prisoner free, He sets the prisoner free
 His blood can make the foulest clean
 His blood availed for me, His blood availed for me
 His blood availed for me, His blood availed for me

[V4]
 He speaks and listening to His voice
 New life the dead receive, new life the dead receive
 The mournful broken hearts rejoice
 The humble poor believe, the humble poor believe
 The humble poor believe, the humble poor believe

[V5]
 Hear Him ye deaf, His praise ye dumb
 Your loosened tongues employ, your loosened tongues employ
 Ye blind behold your Saviour come
 And leap ye lame for joy, and leap ye lame for joy
 And leap ye lame for joy, and leap ye lame for joy

[V6]
 My gracious Master and my God
 Assist me to proclaim, assist me to proclaim
 To spread through all the earth abroad
 The honours of Thy name, the honours of Thy name
 The honours of Thy name, the honours of Thy name</lyrics></song>
