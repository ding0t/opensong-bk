  <lyrics>[V1]
.  G                               D             G     G7
 I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene,
.    C                   G
 And wonder how he could love me,
.            D7        G
 A sinner condemned, unclean.

[C]
.G
 How marvelous, how wonderful,
.D                 D7
 And my song shall ever be:
.G
 How marvelous, how wonderful,
.Am7   G         G    D7  G
 Is my Saviour's love for me.

[V2]
 For me it was in the garden
 He prayed - 'Not my will, but thine';
 He had no tears for his own griefs,
 But sweat drops of blood for mine.

[V3]
 In pity angels beheld him,
 And came from the world of light,
 To comfort him in the sorrows
 He bore for my soul that night.

[V4]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden to Calvary,
 And suffered and died alone.

[V5]
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face at last I'll see,
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me.</lyrics></song>
