.G             C G D/G     G        C       D
 Nothing shall separate us from the love of God
.G             C G D/G     G        C    D  G
 Nothing shall separate us from the love of God

[V1]
.D           G     D        G
 God did not spare His only Son
.     C      G       D
 Gave Him to save us all
.D               G   D         G
 Sin's price was met by Jesus' death
.    C        G     D
 And heaven's mercy falls

[V2]
 Up from the grave Jesus was raised
 To sit at God's right hand
 Pleading our cause in heaven's courts
 Forgiven we can stand

[V3]
 Now by God's grace we have embraced
 A life set free from sin
 We shall deny all that destroys
 Our union with Him</lyrics></song>
