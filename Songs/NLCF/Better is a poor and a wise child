  <lyrics>.G                                         D               G
 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king
.G                                         D               G
 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king
.    C                  G/B         Am                D
 For if that king don't listen when wise men give him warning
.G                                         D               G
 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king</lyrics></song>
