  <lyrics>[V1]
.           D                        G     A
 As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet,
.       D                      G          D
 So you love this city and you love these streets.
.      D                          G         A
 Every child out playing by their own front door
.      D                  G       D
 Every baby laying on the bedroom floor. 

[V2]	
 Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job
 Every driver driving through the rush hour mob
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
 You're going to send revival, bring them all back home 

[C]
.      G         A              D
 I can hear that thunder in the distance
.       G            A       Bm
 Like a train on the edge of town
.      G        A                Bm
 I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
.G         A       Bm    G        A       D
 "Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down". 

[V3]
 From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry
 To the lost soul reaching for a higher high
 From the young man working through his hopes and fears
 To the widow walking through the veil of tears 

[V4]
 Every man and woman, every old and young
 Every fathers daughter, every mothers son.
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
 You're going to send revival, bring them all back home 

[B]
.  D          Bm
 Revive us, revive us,
.  G       G/B       D
 Revive us with your fire!</lyrics></song>
