[V1]
.    A/E                             E
 The desert and the dry land will be glad
.    A/E                    E
 The wilderness rejoice and blossom
.       A              E/G#
 Like a flower it will bloom
.                  F#m7                       E   
 With praise and shouts of joy
.               A                   E/G#     F#m7                 B7sus4  B7/A
 Its beauty shall reflect the splendour of our God.

[C]
.          E     A/E            E
 There's a River flowing in the desert
.   C#m7       A      B7sus4  B7/A
 Be strong and do not fear
.          E     A/E            E     
 There's a River flowing in the desert
.    A        B        E         
 Our God will come for us.

[V2]
 The eyes of the blind now will see
 And the ears of the deaf will now hear
 The lame will dance in praise 
 And the mute with songs declare
 The power of the Lord is flowing everywhere

[V3]
 The Way of Holiness now lies ahead
 Only those who walk in Holiness can tread
 And the ransomed will return
 To the presence of their King
 Into Zion we will go, and with gladness we now sing</lyrics></song>
