[V]
.G               D/F#            C/E            G/D
 God will make a way where there seems to be no way
.   C                G/B         Am7            Cmaj7/D D
 He works in ways we cannot see, He will make a way for me
.G             D/F#           C/E            G/D
 He will be my guide, hold me closely to His side
.     C                     G/B           Am7
 With love and strength for each new day, He will make a way
.Cmaj7/D D      G   (Am7  C/D  to repeat)
 He will make a way

[C]
.G/F  Eb             F                Eb/Bb Bb
 By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead  me
.    Eb            F             Gsus4  G
 And rivers in the desert will I see
.C                     D/C           Bm        B/D#    Em
 Heaven and earth will fade, but His word will still remain
.Am7        D               Esus4 E   D/F#
 He will do something new today</lyrics></song>
