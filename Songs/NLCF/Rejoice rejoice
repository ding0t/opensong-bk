[C]
.D                 G      D  A7  D
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Christ is in you
.    Bm            Em7    A
 The hope of glory in our hearts
.   D                      G      D  A7 D
 He lives!  He lives!  His breath is in you
.Bm             Em7 A    D  (As intro)
 Arise a mighty army, we arise

[V1]
.A                         Bm
 Now is the time for us to march upon the land
.         G             A                  D
 Into our hands He will give the ground we claim
.A                      Bm
 He rides in majesty to lead us in to victory
.G               Bm                 Em7  A
 The world shall see that Christ is Lord

[V2]
 God is at work in us, His purpose to perform
 Building a kingdom of power, not of words
 Where things impossible by faith shall be made possible
 Let's give the glory to Him now

[V3]
 Though we are weak, His grace is everything we need
 We're made of clay, but this treasure is within
 He turns our weaknesses into His opportunities 
 So that the glory goes to Him</lyrics></song>
