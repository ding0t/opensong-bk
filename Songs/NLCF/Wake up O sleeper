[V2]
 This is the beautiful fruit of the light
 The good, the righteous, the true
 Let us discover what pleases the Lord
 In everything that we do
 Wake up sleeper!

[V3]
 As days get darker, take care how you live
 Not as unwise, but as wise
 Making the most of each moment He gives
 And pressing on for the prize
 Wake up sleeper!</lyrics></song>
