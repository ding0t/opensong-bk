  <lyrics>[V1]
.      F                       Bb        C
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night
.    F      G      C
 All seated on the ground
.   Bb           Gm        A
 An angel of the Lord came down
.    Gm    C      F
 And glory shone around

[V2]
 'Fear not' said he - for mighty dread
 Had seized their troubled mind -
 'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
 To you and all mankind'

[V3]
 'To you in David's town this day
 Is born of David's line,
 A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord
 And this shall be the sign'

[V4]
 'The heavenly babe you there shall find
 To human view displayed,
 All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
 And in a manger laid'

[V5]
 Thus spake the angel; and forthwith
 Appeared a shining throng
 Of angels praising God, who thus
 Addressed their joyful song:

[V6]
 'All glory be to God on high,
 And to the earth be peace;
 Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men
 Begin and never cease'</lyrics></song>
