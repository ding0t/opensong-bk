  <lyrics>[V1]
.G2                        Em7
 Holy Ghost, You wonderful Holy Ghost,
.               C2 C/D               G2
 A wind blowing strong, blowing from heaven.
.G2                        Em7
 Holy Ghost, You wonderful Holy Ghost,
.               C2 C/D               G2
 A wind blowing strong, blowing from heaven.

[C]
.Bm7                Em7 C2                      G2
 We have decided to go, all of the way with our God.
.Bm7                             Em7
 Revival in the land, that's our goal;
.   C2              G
 As soldiers in His army,
.      F                    Dsus4
 We'll fight with heart and soul.

[V2]
 Blood and fire, we call upon blood and fire,
 A wind blowing strong, blowing from heaven.
 Blood and fire, we call upon blood and fire,
 A wind blowing strong, blowing from heaven.</lyrics></song>
