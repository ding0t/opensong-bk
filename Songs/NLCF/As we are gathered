.G         C         D        G
 As we are gathered, Jesus is here
.G             C      D        G                               
 One with each other, Jesus is here
.C             D       G             Em
 Joined by the Spirit, washed in the blood
.C          A          D      A/E D/F#  D7
 Part of the body, the church of  God
.G         C         D        G
 As we are gathered, Jesus is here
.G             C      D        G
 One with each other, Jesus is here</lyrics></song>
