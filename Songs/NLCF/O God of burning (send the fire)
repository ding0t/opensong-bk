  <lyrics>[V1]
.  A               D         A               E
 O God of burning, cleansing flame: send the fire!
.     A                   D      A      D        E      A
 Your blood bought gift today we claim: send the fire today!
.     E                 D       A
 Look down and see this waiting host,
.    E                 D    A
 And send the promised Holy Ghost;
.A/G# F#m          E    A
 We   need another Pentecost!  
.D        E      A   A/G# F#m  E   D        E      A
 Send the fire today!              Send the fire today!

[V2]
 God of Elijah, hear our cry: send the fire!
 And make us fit to live or die: send the fire today!
 To burn up every trace of sin,
 To bring the light and glory in,
 The revolution now begin!
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!

[V3]
 It's fire we want, for fire we plead: send the fire!
 The fire will meet our every need: send the fire today!
 For strength to always do what's right,
 For grace to conquer in the fight,
 For power to walk the world in white:
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!

[V4]
 To make our weak hearts strong and brave: send the fire!
 To live, a dying world to save: send the fire today!
 Oh, see us in Your altar lay,
 We give our lives to You today,
 So crown the offering now we pray:
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!</lyrics></song>
