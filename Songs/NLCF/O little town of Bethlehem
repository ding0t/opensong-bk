  <lyrics>[V1]
.  F                             Gm       C       F	
 O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see you lie!
.F                                       Gm     C        F
 Above your deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by:
.    F                                Dm  G7      C7
 Yet in your dark streets shining the everlasting Light;
.    F                                    Gm     C     F
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in You tonight.

[V2]
 For Christ is born of Mary; and gathered all above,
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep|Their watch of wondering love.
 O morning stars, together proclaim the Holy birth,
 And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth.

[V3]
 How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given!
 So God imparts to human hearts the blessing of His heaven.
 No ear may hear His coming; but in this world of sin,
 Where meek souls will receive Him, still the dear Lord enters in.

[V4]
 O holy child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;
 Cast out our sin, and enter in; be born in us today.
 We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;
 O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel.
