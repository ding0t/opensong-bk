.F               Bb/F       F           C
 Love songs from heaven are filling the earth,
.F              Bb          F C
 Bringing great hope to all nations.
.F        Bb/F           F        C
 Evil has prospered, but truth is alive;
.F            Bb        F     C     F
 In this dark world the light still shines.

[V2]
 Nothing has silenced this gospel of Christ;
 It echoes down through the ages.
 Blood of the martyrs has made Your church strong;
 In this dark world the light still shines.

[C]
.C          F             C          F
 For You we live, and for You we may die;
.Bb             F/A      C
 Through us may Jesus be seen.
.C        F            C         F  
 For You alone we will offer our lives;
.F            Bb        F     C    F
 In this dark world our light will shine.

[V3]
 Let every nation be filled with Your song:
 This is the cry of your people.
 We will not settle for anything less,
 In this dark world our light must shine.</lyrics></song>
