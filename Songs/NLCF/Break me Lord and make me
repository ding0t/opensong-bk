[V1]
.  D                 A/C#
 I surrender to Your Holy ways,
.       G               Em
 I will bow before Your throne, Lord,
.       G               A
 I will bow before Your throne.
.       D                 A/C#
 I will give You Lord, my everything,
.       G                Em
 I will go where You may lead me,
.       G                A
 I will go where You may call.

[V2]
 Lead me Lord, and guide me in Your ways,
 All my days I choose to follow,
 Every day, Lord, I will come.
 Teach me Lord, and show me not in part,
 For Lord, You've set my heart on fire,
 And Lord my heart is Yours.</lyrics></song>
