[V1]
.           Bb                 Eb        Cm  Bb
 You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb that was slain,
.                           Eb             F
 You ascended to heaven and ever more will reign;
.       Bb                      Eb          Bb
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim,
.                              F
 You will gather the nations before You.||
.                                                           Eb   F
 And the eyes of all men|will be fixed on the Lamb,|who was crucified
.                                                           Eb       F
 For with wisdom and mercy|and justice You'll reign|at Your Fatherâ€™s side

[C]
.        Bb                Eb   Bb  F    (F/Eb   F/D  F/C  F  F/Eb  F/D  F/C)
 And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb
.        Bb                   Eb   Bb F  (F/Eb   F/D  F/C  F  F/Eb  F/D  F/C)
 Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.'
.        Bb                 Eb  Bb    F  (F/Eb   F/D  F/C  F  F/Eb  F/D  F/C)
 And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign
.       Bb                        Eb   Dm Dm/C Bb     (Bb     Eb Bb        Eb  Bb)
 As the King of all kings and the Lord of all  lords.' 

[V2]
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side,
 There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied;
 As the Father has told us for these You have died,
 For the nations that gather before You.||
 And the ears of all men|need to hear of the Lamb|who was crucified,
 Who descended to hell|yet was raised up to reign|at the Father's side.</lyrics>
