  <lyrics>[V1]
.G             D
 God’s love is deeper than the deepest ocean,
.G             C              D
 God’s love is wider than the widest sea
.G             D
 God’s love is higher than the highest mountain
.C       D      G D/F# Em Em/D  C        D       G
 Deeper, wider, higher,         is God’s love to me.

[V2]
 God’s grace is deeper than the deepest ocean,
 God’s grace is wider than the widest sea
 God’s grace is higher than the highest mountain
 Deeper, wider, higher, is God’s grace to me.

[V3]
 God’s joy is deeper than the deepest ocean,
 God’s joy is wider than the widest sea
 God’s joy is higher than the highest mountain
 Deeper, wider, higher, is God’s joy to me.

[V4]
 God’s peace is deeper than the deepest ocean,
 God’s peace is wider than the widest sea
 God’s peace is higher than the highest mountain
 Deeper, wider, higher, is God’s peace to me.

.C       D      G D/F# Em Em/D

.C       D      G D/F# Em Em/D
 Deeper, wider, higher,
.C       D      G D/F# Em Em/D
 Deeper, wider, higher,
.   C  D   G
 Is God to me.</lyrics>
