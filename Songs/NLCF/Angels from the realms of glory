 Now proclaim Messiah's birth.

[V2]
.G                D      G
 Shepherds in the fields abiding,
.Em          G    D         G
 Watching by your flocks at night.
.G               D     G
 God with man is now residing,
.G                     D      G
 See, there shines the infant light.

.G                   D     G
 Wise men leave your contemplations,
.Em          G    D      G
 Brighter visions shine afar.
.G               D       G
 Seek in Him the hope of nations,
.G                 D      G
 You have seen His rising star.

[V4]
.G                 D      G
 Though an infant, now we view Him,
.Em            G   D        G
 He will share His Father's throne,
.G              D       G
 Gather all the nations to Him,
.G                D        G
 Every knee shall then bow down.</lyrics></song>
