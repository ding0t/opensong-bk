  <lyrics>[V1]
.       C
 He has fire in His eyes,|And a sword in His hand
.         C
 And He's riding a white horse|Across this land
.       F
 He has fire in His eyes,|And a sword in His hand
.              C
 He's riding a white horse|All across this land
.         G                                        C
 And He's calling out to you and me|"Will you ride with Me?"

[V2]
 He has fire in His eyes,|And a sword in His hand
 And He's riding a white horse|Across this land
 And He's calling out to you and me|"Will you ride with Me?"
 And we say "yes, yes Lord,|we'll ride with You"

[C]
.           C
 And we say yes Lord, we'll ride with You,|We will stand up and fight,
.        F                                                   C
 We will ride with the armies of heaven,|We'll be dressed in white
.            G                      C
 And we say "yes, yes Lord, we will ride"

[V3]
 He has a crown on His head,|Carries sceptre in His hand
 And He's leading the armies|All across this land
 And He's calling out to you and me,|"Will you ride with Me"
 And we say "yes, yes Lord,|We'll ride with You"

[V4]
 That fire in His eyes,|Is His love for His bride
 And He's longing that she be with Him,|Right by His side
 That fire in His eyes,|Is His burning desire  
 That His bride be with Him,|Right by His side
 And He's calling out to us right now|"Will you ride with Me"
