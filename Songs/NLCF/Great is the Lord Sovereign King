 Sovereign King ___ we give You praise.         

[V1]
.    B          C#m          A       E
 You spoke Your word and You rescued me,

 You poured out Your grace and You set me free.

 Now You've filled my life with the Spirit's power,

 And You've set my heart on fire

[V2]
 And by the power of Jesus' name
 You have raised me up from my sin and shame.
 You've anointed me with the Spirit's power,
 And You've set my heart on fire.

[V3]
 By grace I'm saved through faith in God,
 Not by works alone but by Jesus' blood
 Now I'm filled with strength by the Spirit's power,
 And You've set my heart on fire.
