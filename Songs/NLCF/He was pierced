[V]
.E      B/F#        A        B/F#
 He was pierced for our transgressions

 He was crushed for our iniquities 
.E      B/F#        A        B/F#
 He was pierced for our transgressions
.A      E           F#m F#m/A  B 
 He was crushed for our iniquities
.        G#              C#m/E                F#m   F#m/A    E
 And the punishment that brought us peace was fully borne by Him

 Through the blood that Jesus shed, we are healed

 And the curse of sin and death and hell 
.    E7/G#            A
 Has all been laid on Him

 By His wounds, nail pierced wounds

 By His wounds, we are healed</lyrics></song>
