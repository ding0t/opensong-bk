.D            A            D      G     A      D 
 All to Jesus I surrender,|All to Him I freely give 
.D           A                   D      G        A     D 
 I will ever love and trust Him,|In His presence daily live 

[C]  
.D           A    A7          D
 I surrender all, I surrender all
.D               D7      G
 All to Thee, my blessed Saviour
.D    A      D   
 I surrender all

[V2]
 All to Jesus I surrender,|Humbly at His feet I bow
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken,|Take me Jesus, take me now

[V3]
 All to Jesus I surrender,|Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine
 Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,|Truly know that Thou art mine

[V4]
 All to Jesus I surrender,|Lord I give myself to Thee
 Fill me with Thy love and power,|Let Thy blessing fall on me

[V5]
 All to Jesus I surrender,|Now I feel the sacred flame
 Oh, the joy of full salvation,|Glory, glory to His name</lyrics></song>
