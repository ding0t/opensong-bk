  <lyrics>;INTRO.    D   D/F#   G/B   A   D     (Last line of chorus)   

[V1]
.D            D/F#   A           D    A
 Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son
.D              D/F#    G/B       A          D
 Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won
.D                A7 Bm    Em7              F#
 Angels in bright raiment, rolled the stone away
.Bm       Bm/A   E/G#  E7      F#m       E     A (A/G A/F# A/E)
 Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay

[C]
.D            D/F#   A           D    A
 Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son
.D              D/F#    G/B       A          D
 Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won

[V2]
 Lo, Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb
 Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom
 Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing
 For her Lord now liveth, death has lost its sting

[V3]
 No more we doubt Thee glorious Prince of life
 Life is nought without Thee, aid us in our strife
 Make us more than conquerors, through Thy deathless love
 Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above</lyrics></song>
