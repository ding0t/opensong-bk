[V1]
.C7 F   Bb/F F          F7         Bb		
 Away in a   manger, no crib for a bed,
.Bb/A Gm          F          G              C7	
 The  little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head,
.    F       Bb/F F                 F7            Bb	
 The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
.Bb/A Gm          F      Gm       C7  F    Gm   F   Gm  C7 F
 The  little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

[V2]
.C7  F     Bb/F F           F7    Bb		
 The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
.Bb/A Gm          F         G         C7	
 But  little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes,
.  F        Bb/F F           F7            Bb	
 I love You Lord Jesus, look down from the sky,
.Bb/A Gm         F          Gm      C7 F    Gm   F   Gm  C7 F
 And  stay by my side until morning is nigh.

[V3]
.C7 F       Bb/F F        F7         Bb		
 Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay,
.Bb/A  Gm       F         G         C7	
 Close by me forever, and love me I pray,
.      F       Bb/F F           F7          Bb	
 Bless all the dear children in Your tender care,
.Bb/A Gm         F         Gm        C7  F     Gm   F   Gm  C7 F
 And  fit us for heaven to live with You there.</lyrics>
