.G              D        Em           C
 Bells they are ringing, children are singing,
.G           D                     C
 And we are exalting the name over all.
.G              D        Em              C
 Flags they are dancing, the church is advancing,
.G           D                     C
 As we are romancing the name over all.

[C]
.       G                D
 Jesus' kingdom can't be shaken,
.       Em7              C
 Jesus' promise can't be broken,
.       G              D
 Jesus, Lord of all creation
.          Csus4   C
 Name over all.
.       G            D
 Jesus, truth of liberation,
.       Em7             C
 Jesus, light of our salvation,
.       G           D
 Jesus, only way to heaven, 
.              C
 The name over all.
