[V1]
 There's a place where the streets shine
 With the glory of the Lamb
 There's a way we can go there
 We can live there beyond time

[C1]
.           E               A
 Because of You, because of You
.           E                     A
 Because of Your love, because of Your blood

[V2]
 No more pain, no more sadness
 No more suffering, no more tears
 No more sin, no more sickness
 No injustice, no more death

[C2]
 Because of You, because of You
 Because of Your love, because of Your blood
			
[B]
.        D                        A
 Oh, our sins are washed away|and we can live forever
.E                                A
 Now we have this hope because of You
.          D                        A
 Oh, we'll see You face to face|and we will dance together
.       E                          A
 In the city of our God because of You

[V3]
 There is joy everlasting
 There is gladness, there is peace
 There is wine ever flowing
 There's a wedding, there's a feast</lyrics>
