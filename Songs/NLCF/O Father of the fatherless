.  G             D  D#dim7     Em       D    C   Bm7 Am7
 O Father of the fatherless|In whom all families are blessed 
.  G  Em            A7     Am7/D   D
 I love the way You father me
.    G                D        D#dim7    Em      D        C   Bm7 Am7
 You gave me life, forgave the past,|Now in Your arms I'm safe at last 
.  G Em             Am7  D G   C   G 
 I love the way You father me

[C]
.G      D      Am7         Em7    D
 Father me, forever You'll father me
.    C         G          D
 And in Your embrace I'll be
.   Am7    Em7
 Forever secure
.C          G/B     D      Em
 I love the way You father me
.C          G/B     D      G   C   G  (D)
 I love the way You father me

[V2]
 When bruised and broken I draw near|You hold me close and dry my tears
 I love the way You father me
 At last my fearful heart is still,|Surrendered to Your perfect will
 I love the way You father me

[V3]
 If in my foolishness I stray,|Returning empty and ashamed
 I love the way You father me
 Exchanging for my wretchedness,|Your radiant robes of righteousness
 I love the way You father me

[V4]
 And when I look into Your eyes,|From deep within my spirit cries
 I love the way You father me
 Before such love I stand amazed|And ever will through endless days
 I love the way You father me</lyrics></song>
