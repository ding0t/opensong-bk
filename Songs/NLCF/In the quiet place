.       F
 In the quiet place,|(In the quiet place)
.             Gm      C
 There will I come to know You
.       F
 In the quiet place,|(In the quiet place)
.         Gm        C
 Still my heart and search me||
.       F
 In the quiet place,|(In the quiet place)
.       Gm      C
 I will come to meet You	
.       F                    Bb
 In the quiet place|(In the quiet place)
.       F                    Bb
 In the quiet place|(In the quiet place)

[V1]
.C                F
 All I have I lay down
.Bb   F                  C
 All around takes second place
.Dm       C/E        F
 My one desire to be here
.Dm      C               Bb	   Bb/C
 Just to know You as I'm known

[V2]
 On my knees Lord, I come
 On the floor Lord, I will lay
 Your awesome power in this place
 On Holy ground, I long to stand

[V3]
 With tears before You I bow
 In surrender, Lord, I come
 In Your love Lord, I am lost
 Yet in Your mercy I am found</lyrics></song>
