 Who from the beginning was the mighty Word

[V2]
 Mighty and mysterious, in the highest height
 God from everlasting, very Light of light
 In the Father's bosom, with the Spirits blest
 Love in love eternal, rest in perfect rest

[V3]
 Humbled for a season, to receive a name
 From the lips of sinners, unto whom He came
 Faithfully He bore it, spotless to the last
 Brought it back victorious, when from death He passed

[V4]
 Bore it up triumphant, with its human light
 Through all ranks of creatures, to the central height
 To the throne of Godhead, to the Father's breast
 Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest

[V5]
 In your hearts entrone Him, there let Him subdue
 All that is not Holy, all that is not true
 Crown Him as your captain, in temptations hour
 Let His will enfold you in its light and power
     
[V6]
 Brothers, this Lord Jesus, shall return again
 With His Father's glory, with His angel train
 For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow
 And our hearts confess Him King of glory now</lyrics></song>
