.D     D2                 G/D  D
 Come, now is the time to wor__ship,
.A                        Em7  D/F# G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart;
.D     D2                 G/D  D
 Come, just as you are to wor__ship,
.A                     Em7    D/F# G G/A D
 Come, just as you are before your God,  come.

[C]
.G                            D
 One day every tongue will confess You are God,
.G                       D
 One day every knee will bow;
.G                             Bm7
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
.    Em                A2
 Who gladly choose You now.</lyrics>
