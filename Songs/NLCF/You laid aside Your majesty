.G         D             Em           Bm             C
 You laid aside Your majesty, gave up everything for me,
.         G               Am7             C/D D
 Suffered at the hands of those you had created;
.G        D                Em              Bm             C
 You took all my guilt and shame, when You died and rose again
.      G                 Am7                C/D D  
 Now today You reign, in heaven and earth exalted.

[C]
.G                D               Em
 I really want to worship You, my Lord;
.                Bm             C
 You have won my heart and I am Yours
.    A              Am7    C/D  D 
 For ever and ever; I will love You.
.G                D                Em
 You are the only one who died for me,
.          Bm             C
 Gave Your life to set me free,
.     A                Am7       D  G    (C   D)
 So I lift my voice to You in adoration.</lyrics></song>
