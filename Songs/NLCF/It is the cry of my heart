[C]
.E         A         B        A      E
 It is the cry of my heart to follow You.
.E         A         B           C#m   B  E
 It is the cry of my heart to be close to You.
.E         A         B        G#
 It is the cry of my heart to follow
.A          B          E    (B/D# to verse)
 All of the days of my life.

[V1]
.C#m           A/C# B       E  
 Teach me Your holy ways, O Lord,
.C#m      F#           B
 So I can walk in Your truth.
.C#m           A/C# B       E
 Teach me Your holy ways, O Lord,
.            A        B        E
 And make me wholly devoted to You, oh, oh, whoah.

[V2]
 Open my eyes so I can see
 The wonderful things that You do.
 Open my heart up more and more
 And make it wholly devoted to You, oh, oh, whoah.</lyrics></song>
