  <lyrics>[V1]
.  C   C/B             Am
 O Lord the clouds are gathering
.    Em7               Fmaj7              C/G  G
 The fire of judgement burns, how we have fallen
.  C   C/B         Am          
 O Lord You stand appalled to see
.     Em7             Fmaj7   Dm7          C/G  G
 Your laws of love so scorned and lives so broken

[C]
.     Am                Am/G
 Have mercy Lord |(Have mercy Lord)
.   F                 C/E
 Forgive us Lord |(Forgive us Lord)
.  B/F#           B/D#               Esus4  E
 Restore us Lord, revive your church again||
.    Am                 Am/G
 Let justice flow |(Let justice flow)
.     F             C/E
 Like rivers |(Like rivers)
.    G/D                  D7            Gsus4  G
 And righteousness like a never failing stream

[V2]
 O Lord over the nations now
 Where is Your dove of peace? Her wings are broken
 O Lord while precious children starve
 The tools of war increase, their bread is stolen

[V3]
 O Lord dark powers are poised to flood
 Our streets with hate and fear, we must awaken
 O Lord let love reclaim the lives
 That sin would sweep away, and let your kingdom come

[V4]
 Yet O Lord, Your glorious cross shall tower
 Triumphant in this land, evil confounding
 Through the fire your suffering church displays
 The glories of her Christ, praises resounding</lyrics></song>
