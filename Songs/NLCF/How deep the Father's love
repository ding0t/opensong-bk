.    E                 F#m  E/G# A2
 How deep the Father's love for  us,
.    E/G#            C#m7 B        
 How vast beyond all measure,
.     E                  F#m E/G# A2
 That He should give his on____ly Son
.   E/B               B   E
 To make a wretch His treasure.
.    E/G#              A/C# E/B A2
 How great the pain of sear_ing loss,
.    E/G#             C#m7 B
 The Father turns His face away,
.   E                    F#m E/G# A2
 As wounds which mar the chos__en One
.      E/B          B  E
 Bring many sons to glory.

;E      F#m E/G# A2       E/B       B  E (AS LAST TWO LINES)

[V2]
 Behold the man upon a cross,
 My sin upon His shoulders;
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
 Call out among the scoffers.
 It was my sin that held Him there
 Until it was accomplished;
 His dying breath has brought me life - 
 I know that it is finished.

[V3]
 I will not boast in anything,
 No gifts no power no wisdom;
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
 His death and resurrection.
 Why should I gain from His reward?
 I cannot give an answer,
 But this I know with all my heart,
 His wounds have paid my ransom.</lyrics></song>
