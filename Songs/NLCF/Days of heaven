[V1]
.G       D/F#   Em7         Bm7
 Days of heaven here on the earth;
.C2         G/B    Am7        D 
 Touched by power, touched by love.
.G       D/F#  Em7         Bm7
 By Your word, and by Your Spirit
.C2            G/B      Am7     D
 You send Your blessing here on us

[C]
.C/G            G     C/G             G
 Lord, send the rain, let Your Spirit come 
.D/F# Em D Cmaj7 Am7 D
 And  glorify    Jesus.
.C/G            G     C/G             G
 Lord, send the rain, let Your Spirit come
.D/F#   Em   D  Cmaj7
 Like a pent up flood,
.Am7           Dsus4  D  G
 Driven by the breath of God.

[V2]
 We bring our worship, we see Your face;
 We stand in wonder of Your grace.
 Your kingdom presence, Your majesty;
 Jesus, You're here now, hear our plea.</lyrics></song>
