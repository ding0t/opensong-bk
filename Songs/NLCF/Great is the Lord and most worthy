.A            Bm            E         A
 Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise
.    Bm          E            F#m
 The city of our God the Holy place
.    A                Bm   Esus4  E
 The joy of the whole earth
.    A            Bm              E             A
 And great is the Lord in whom we have the victory
.   Bm       E            F#m
 He aids us against the enemy
.   A               Bm    Esus4 E
 We bow down on our knees

[C]
.    A                                 C#m
 And Lord we want to lift Your name on high
.D
 And Lord we want to thank You
.        Bm                   E
 For the works You've done in our lives
.    A                               C#m
 And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love
.    D
 For You alone are God eternal
.Bm                   E       A
 Throughout earth and heaven above</lyrics></song>
