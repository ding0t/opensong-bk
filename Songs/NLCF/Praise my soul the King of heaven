 Praise my soul, the King of heaven;|To His feet thy  tribute bring
.F#7       F#7/E     Bm      Esus4 E   F#m E/G# A    Bm  E             A
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,|Who like Thee His praise should sing

 Praise Him! Praise Him! |Praise Him! Praise Him!
.F#m        G Em D A    D
 Praise the everlasting King

[V2]
 Praise Him for His grace and favour,|To our fathers in distress
 Praise Him, still the same forever,|Slow to chide and quick to bless
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Glorious in His faithfulness.

[V3]
 Father-like, He tends and spares us;|Well our feeble frame He knows
 In His hands He gently bears us,|Rescues us from all our foes
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Widely as His mercy flows

[V4]
 Angels in the height, adore Him;|Ye behold Him  face to face;
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him,|Dwellers all in time and space.
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Praise with us the God of grace!</lyrics></song>
