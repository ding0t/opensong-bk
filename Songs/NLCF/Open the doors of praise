.A        D/A      A  D/A 
 Open the doors of praise,        
.A        D/A      A  D/A
 Open the doors of praise
.A        D/A      A          E                 A
 Open the doors of praise and let the Lord come in ______________ x2

[V1]
.       E      A                E            A
 In the spirit world |thereâ€™s a battle going on,
.       D     A/C#   Bm7 Esus4  E
 And it rages endlessly,
.           C#m         F#m           C#m          F#m
 But in the name of the Lord, |we can stand on His word,
.       D      A/C#         Bm7  Esus4  E
 For in Him we have the victory.

[B]

 For He lives in the praises of His people
 (For He lives in the praises of His people)
.E              Bm7  E7
 Here among us, to empower us !

[V2]
 And the demons will flee, |as He said it would be,
 And the skies will ring |with shouts of praise.
 And the Lord Jesus Christ |will be lifted high,
 The Holy One who truly saves !
 
[B2]
 For He lives in the praises of his people
 (For He lives in the praises of His people)
 Here among us to empower us !</lyrics>
