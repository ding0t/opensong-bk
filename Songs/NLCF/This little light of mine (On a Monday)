.G                          G7
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
.C     G          C          G       D    C
 Ev'ry day, ev'ry day, ev'ry day in ev'ry way.

 I'm gonna let my little light shine

[C]
.     G
 On a Monday, He gave me the gift of love
.     C
 On a Tuesday, His peace came down from above
.     G
 On a Wednesday, He told me just what to say
.     D
 On a Thursday, He told me just how to pray||
.     G
 On a Friday, He gave me a little more faith	
.     C
 On a Saturday, He gave me a lot more grace
.     G                      B7    Em
 On a Sunday, He gave me the power divine
.   G	    D            G
 To let my little light shine</lyrics></song>
