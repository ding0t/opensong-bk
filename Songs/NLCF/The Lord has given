  <lyrics>[V1]
.             G
 The Lord has given a land of good things
.                              D  
 I will press in and make them mine
.              G
 I'll know His power I'll know His glory
.                   D      G
 And in His kingdom I will shine

[C]
.   D7       G               G7
 So with the high praises of God in my mouth
.          C                 G
 And a two edged sword in my hand
.      G                     Em
 We'll march right on to the victory side
.Am         D        G  C  G  D 
 Right into Canaan's land

[V2]
 Gird up your armour ye sons of Zion 
 Gird up your armour lets go to war
 We'll win this battle with great rejoicing
 And so we'll praise Him more and more

[V3]
 We'll bind their kings in chains and fetters
 We'll bind their nobles tight in iron
 To execute God's written judgement
 March on to glory sons of Zion</lyrics></song>
