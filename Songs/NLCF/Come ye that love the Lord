.D            A        D                          A
 Come ye that love the Lord, and let your joys be known
.     D    G         A
 Join in a song with sweet accord
.     D    G         A
 Join in a song with sweet accord
.    D    A  D         G   
 And thus surround the throne
.    D       A         D     G  D  A
 And thus surround the throne

[C]
.      D                                      A
 We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion 
.      D        D7        G         D         A       D  G  D  A
 We're marching upward to Zion, The beautiful city of God 
		 
[V2]
 Let those who refuse to sing, who never knew our God
 But children of the Heavenly King
 But children of the Heavenly King
 Must speak their joys abroad
 Must speak their joys abroad

[V3]
 The hill of Zion yields, a thousand sacred sweets
 Before we reach the Heavenly fields
 Before we reach the Heavenly fields
 Or walk the golden streets
 Or walk the golden streets

[V4]
 Then let our songs abound and every tear be dry
 We're marching through Immanuel's ground
 We're marching through Immanuel's ground
 To fairer worlds on high
 To fairer worlds on high</lyrics></song>
