  <lyrics>[V1]
.   C         Dm7                G       F   C
 My Lord what love is this,|That pays so dearly
.     C     Dm7         F   G  C
 That I the guilty one,|May go free

[C]
. Gm           F      C
 Amazing love, O what sacrifice
.    Gm         F         C
 The Son of God given for me
.   Gm           F      C      
 My debt He pays and my death he dies
.    Dm F     C         Dm F     C
 That I might live, that I might live

[V2]
 And so they watched Him die,|Despised, rejected
 But Oh, the blood He shed,|Flowed for me

[V3]
 And now, this love of Christ,|Shall flow like rivers
 Come wash Your guilt away,|Live again</lyrics></song>
