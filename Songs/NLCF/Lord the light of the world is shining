 From the shadows into Your radiance
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness
 Search me, try me, consume all my darkness 
 Shine on me, shine on me

 As we gaze on Your kingly brightness
 So our faces display Your likeness
 Ever changing from glory to glory
 Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story
 Shine on me, shine on me</lyrics>
