.Eb         Cm7       Ab         Eb
 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart,
.Bb            Cm7        Ab             Bb
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art;
.Abmaj7       Gm7        Eb        Ab   Bb
 Thou my best thought by day or by night,
.Eb        Cm7           Ab2         Eb
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

[V2]
.Eb         Cm7        Ab           Eb
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word,
.Bb     Cm7           Ab            Bb
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
.Abmaj7        Gm7         Eb         Ab Bb
 Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,
.Eb         Cm7           Ab2         Eb
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

[V3]
.F        Dm7           Bb          F
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
.C           Dm7       Bb        C
 Thou mine Inheritance now and always;
.Bbmaj7        Am7   F           Bb   C
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
.F            Dm7        Bb2           F
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

[V4]
.F            Dm7       Bb      F
 High King of heaven my victory won,
.C           Dm7            Bb                C
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun;
.Bbmaj7      Am7            F      Bb  C
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
.F           Dm7       Bb2      F
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.</lyrics>
