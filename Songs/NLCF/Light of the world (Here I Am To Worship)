  <lyrics>[V1]
.E            Bsus4              F#m
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness,
.E         Bsus4        A2
 Opened my eyes, let me see;
.E           Bsus4     F#m
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
.E         Bsus4           A2
 Hope of a life spent with You.

[C]
.(B7)         E                     B/D#
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,
.             E/G#               Asus2
 Here I am to say that You're my God;
.                  E                  B/D#
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
.           E/G#         A2
 Altogether wonderful to me.

[V2]
.E           Bsus4       F#m
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
.E           Bsus4   A2
 Glorious in Heaven above;
.E          Bsus4       F#m
 Humbly You came to the earth You created,
.E              Bsus4       A2
 All for loveâ€™s sake became poor.

[B]
.           B/D#  E/G#     A
 And I'll never know how much it cost
.   B/D#   E/G# A        Bsus4/A
 To see my sin upon that cross.  ______ x2</lyrics>
