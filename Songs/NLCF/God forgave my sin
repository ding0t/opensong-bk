 God forgave my sin in Jesus' name
.          F#m  B7       E      E7
 I've been born again in Jesus' name
.       A      E      F#m  B7 E               
 And in Jesus' name I come to you
.   C#m       G#m        F#m  B7 E  
 To share His love as He told me to

[C]
.A  B7   E              F#m        B7

 Others will know that I live
