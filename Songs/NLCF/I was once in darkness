.G             C         D               G
 I was once in darkness, now my eyes can see
.C              D                G     D 
 I was lost but Jesus sought and found me
.G              C       D               G
 O what love He offers, O what peace He gives
.C              D              G  C  G  D
 I will sing forever more, 'He lives'

[C]
.G          C      D           G
 Hallelujah Jesus, hallelujah, Lord
.C           D            G               D 
 Hallelujah, Father, I am shielded by His word
.G              C     D            G
 I will live forever, I will never die
.  C               D               G  C  G  D
 I will rise up to meet Him in the sky</lyrics></song>
