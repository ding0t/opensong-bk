.C                  F
 See Him lying on a bed of straw,
.  G                       C
 A draughty stable with an open door,
.C                 F
 Mary cradling the babe she bore;
.    G                      C    C7
 The Prince of glory is His name

[C]
.F                 C/E   Am
 O now carry me to Bethlehem,
.   Dm      G7     C    
 To see the Lord appear to men;
.C       A7              Dm
 Just as poor as was the stable then,
.    G7                      C
 The Prince of glory when He came.

[V2]
 Star of silver, sweep across the skies,
 Show where Jesus in the manger lies;
 Shepherds, swiftly from your stupor rise
 To see the Saviour of the world.

[V3]
 Angels, sing again the song you sang,
 Bring God’s glory to the heart of man;
 Sing that Bethlehem’s little baby can
 Be salvation to the soul

[V4]
 Mine are riches, from Thy poverty,
 From Thine innocence eternity;
 Mine, forgiveness by Thy death for me,
 Child of sorrow for my joy.</lyrics></song>
