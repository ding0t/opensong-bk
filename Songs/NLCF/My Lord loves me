  <lyrics>[V1]
.   D    A     D       G     D         A 
 My Lord loves me, and O the wonders I see
.  G   A   D                 G          D    A     D
 A rainbow shines through my window, my Lord loves me

[V2]
.   D    A   D        G        D    A
 He died for me, on a cross at Calvary
.   G    A  D          G             D    A   D
 He bore my sin and my shame when He died for me

[V3]
.   D     A       D             G            D            A
 He rose from the dead, and the promise come true that He said
.     G    A       D           G            D    A        D
 I'll stay close beside you forever when He rose from the dead</lyrics></song>
