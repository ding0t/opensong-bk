.G         Em
 My Jesus, my lifeline,
.C          Dsus4          D    G
 I need You more than I've ever known.
.G              Em
 There's no one quite like You,
.C          Dsus4        D
 I'm crying out for Your loving.

[C]
.C2        Em7  C2
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
.            Em7    D/F#    C
 Accept this love I give to You,
.               G
 It's all I can do.

[V2]
 I'm searching, I'm longing,
 Please meet me just as You want to.
 I'll stand here to offer,
 Offer up this song of love to You.</lyrics></song>
