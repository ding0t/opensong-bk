 Worthy of honour and worthy of glory
.                        B7
 And worthy of praise is He

 Worthy of honour and worthy of glory
.                        E
 And worthy of praise is He||
.
 He has redeemed me by the blood of the Lamb
.     E7            A
 He's set my spirit free
.     F#m                  E
 He's worthy of honour and worthy of glory
.    B7                  E  A  E  B7
 And worthy of praise is He</lyrics></song>
