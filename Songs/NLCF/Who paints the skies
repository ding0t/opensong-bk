.G                         D        G
 Who paints the skies into glorious day?
.                      C
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
.G                          D        G
 Who breathes his life into fists of clay? 
.                      D  G
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
.G                          D          G
 Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain? 
.                           		    C     
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
.     	G                       	          D     G
 Who makes the desert to live again?
.                           		     D G       D
 Only the splendour of Jesus.||
.            G          C          D
 Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
.         G            C        D
 Each generation shall sing His praise.

[C]
.G                      C  D
 He is wonderful, He is glorious,
.D                         C       D
 Clothed in righteousness, full of tenderness.
.G                              C         D
 Come and worship Him, He's the Prince of life,
.D                          C      D        G
 He will cleanse our hearts in His river of fire.

[V2]
 Who hears the cry of the barren one?|Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone?|Only the mercy of Jesus
 Who storms the prison and sets men free?|Only the mercy of Jesus
 Purchasing souls for eternity?|Only the mercy of Jesus||
 Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
 Each generation shall sing His praise.</lyrics></song>
