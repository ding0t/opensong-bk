  <lyrics>;INTRO.    Am   Fmaj7   Am   Fmaj7

[V1]
.      Am                   Fmaj7
 Is it true today that when people pray
.          Am                          Fmaj7
 Cloudless skies will break, kings and queens will shake?
.         G             F
 Yes it's true, and I believe it
.               C  G/B  Am7  F
 I'm living for You

[V2]
 Is it true today, that when people pray
 We'll see dead men rise, and the blind set free?
 Yes it's true, and I believe it
 I'm living for You

[C]
.C                      Am            F 
 I'm gonna be a history maker in this land
.C                         Am              F 
 I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind
.C               G/B  Am        F 
 I'm gonna stand,     I'm gonna run 
.          C   G/B           Am    F 
 Into Your arms,   into Your arms again, 
.          C   G/B           Am    F 
 Into Your arms,   into Your arms again.

[V3]
.        Am                    Fmaj7
 Is it's true today, that when people stand
.         Am7                 Fmaj7
 With the fire of God and the truth in hand
.                Am                  Fmaj7
 We're gonna see miracles, we'll see angels sing,
.          Am                   Fmaj7
 We'll see broken hearts making history?
.         G             F 
 Yes it's true, and I believe it
.               C   G/B  Am7  F 
 I'm living for You.</lyrics></song>
