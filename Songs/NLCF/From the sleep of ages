[V1]
.E                 A     E                   B
 From the sleep of ages, I am stirred by the kiss of love,
.E               A       E                B
 By the fragrant perfume when His name is mentioned.
.E                 A             E              B
 I have learned to wait for Him, to receive His presence
.E                 A         E              B
 With the sound of laughter, and the joy of resting.
.    F#m7   G#m A     B  C#m         B  A     B 
 But listen, my Lover is coming from heaven's throne!

[C]
.E                   A
 Over the mountains, leaping the hills
.   E                            B
 He runs like a deer through the open plain,
.E                       A
 Gazing through windows, peering through doors,
.   E                    B
 My Lover is calling and calling again;
.E                   A                  E                      B 
 Rise up, my lovely, beautiful one, the winter is past and the rains are gone;||
.E                  A               E                      B
 Flowers appear all over the earth, these are the promised days. 
.            A  B      E                    A  B      C#m7
 This is the season of singing, this is the season of singing,
.            A  B      E                    A  B      E
 This is the season of singing, this is the season of singing.

[V2]
 There is no preferring in the Lover's loving;
 We are all His treasure, His desired inheritance.
 He has come with blessings from the Father's throne room;
 Gifts of power and healing, for a needy people.
 The wonder, the pleasure of knowing, of being known.</lyrics></song>
