  <lyrics>;INTRO   E  A  E  G#

[V1]
.C#m             G#/C           A
 From heaven You came, helpless babe,
.B/A         E/G#        A/C# E/B B	
 Entered our world, Your glo__ry  veiled;
.C#m       G#/C          A
 Not to be served but to serve,
.B/A           E/G#      A/C# E/B   B      
 And give Your life that we _ might live.

[C]
.B    B/A    E  B7	         C#m  C#m/B
 This is our God, the Servant King,
.            A      B7 A/B E   B7
 He calls us now to follow Him,
.             E          E7/D      A/C#  Eb
 To bring our lives as a daily offering
.           E  B7	      E    G#    (A  B7 to repeat)
 Of worship to the Servant King.

[V2]
 There in the garden of tears,
 My heavy load He chose to bear;
 His heart with sorrow was torn,
 'Yet not my will, but Yours', He said.

[V3]
 Come see His hands and His feet,
 The scars that speak of sacrifice,
 Hands that flung stars into space,
 To cruel nails surrendered.

[V4]
 So let us learn how to serve,
 And in our lives enthrone Him;
 Each other's needs to prefer,
 For it is Christ we're serving.</lyrics></song>
