.E
 Praise Him on the trumpet, the psaltery and harp
.A                         F#m
 Praise Him on the timbrel and the dance
.E                                    B7    
 Praise Him with stringed instruments too
.E                      E7
 Praise Him on the loud cymbals
.A                      F#m
 Praise Him on the loud cymbals
.    E                   B7                 E  A  E  B7
 Let everything that has breath, praise the Lord

[C]
.E           E7               A           F#m
 Hallelujah, praise the Lord, hallelujah, praise the Lord
.    E                                     B7     
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
.E           E7               A           F#m
 Hallelujah, praise the Lord, hallelujah, praise the Lord
.    E                   B7                E  A  E  B7
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord</lyrics></song>
