.B7 E                    F#m
 Crackers and turkey and pudding and cream
.B7                      E
 Toys in the window like I've never seen
.C#m                        F#m
 This is the Christmas that everyone sees
.    B7                      E  B7
 But Christmas means more to me

[C]
.     E                    F#m
 It’s somebody’s birthday, I wont forget
.B7            E
 As I open the things that I get
.     C#m                      F#m
 I’ll remember the Inn and the stable so bare
.    B7                 E       B7
 And Jesus who once lay there

[V2]
 Everyone's out shopping late every night
 For candles and presents and Christmas tree lights
 This is the Christmas that everyone sees
 But Christmas means more to me

[C2]
.     E                    F#m
 It's somebody's birthday, I wont forget
.B7            E
 As I open the things that I get
.     C#m                      F#m
 I'll remember the Inn and the stable so bare
.    B7                 E       C7
 And Jesus who once lay there

.F                     Gm
 Christmas morning the start of the day
.        C7                   F
 There's presents to open and new games to play
.Dm                         Gm
 This is the Christmas that everyone sees
.    C7                      F   C7
 But Christmas means more to me</lyrics></song>
