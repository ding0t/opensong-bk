[V1]
.    A                 D/B      A/C#              D
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
.  A               D/B                 A/C#              D 
 I can't deny what You have shown, the cross speaks of a God of love 
.E                   D           C#m               D 
 There displayed for all to see, Jesus Christ, our only hope 
.  E              D		       C#m                D/B 
 A message of the Father's heart, "Come my children, come on home"
 
[C]
.   A           D            A        E
 As high as the heavens are above the earth
.   A           D          A          E
 So high is the measure of Your great love
.   A          D       A        E
 As far as the east is from the west
.   A            D         A         E  (A) 
 So far have You taken our sins from us

[V2]
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
 I never recognised Your touch, until I met You at the cross
 We are fallen, dust to dust, how could You do this for us
 Son of God, shed precious blood, who can comprehend this love
