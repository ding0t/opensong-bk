  <lyrics>[V1]
.       G          D      C
 Men of faith rise up and sing
.       G         D        C
 Of the great and glorious King
.        G           D        C
 You are strong when you feel weak
.        G     D       C     C
 In your brokenness complete

[C]
.G            C             D
 Shout to the north and the south
.G           C            D
 Sing to the east and the west
.Em7      C          D
 Jesus is Saviour to all 
.C       D          G
 Lord of heaven and earth

[V2]
 Rise up women of the truth
 Stand and sing to broken hearts
 Who can know the healing power
 Of our glorious King of love

[V3]
 Rise up church with broken wings
 Fill this place with songs again
 Of our God who reigns on high
 By His grace again we'll fly

[B]
.Em                       C
 We've been through fire, we've been through rain
.Em                        C
 We've been refined by the power of His name
.Em                  C
 We've fallen deeper in love with You
.C                 G/B          Dsus4  D/C D/B D/A
 You've burned the truth on our lips</lyrics></song>
