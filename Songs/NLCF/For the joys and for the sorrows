  <lyrics>;INTRO.    E    A    E    A

[V1]
.F#m/B            E                   F#m/B             E
 For the joys and for the sorrows the best and worst of times
.F#m/B            E                 F#m           F#m/B  B7
 For this moment, for tomorrow, for all that lies behind
.B                E                 B             E
 Fears that crowd around me for the failure of my plans
.        B         B#dim7  C#m             A#m7(b5)       F#m/B
 For the dreams of all   I hope to be, the truth of what I am

[C]
.B7  F#m/B       E          F#m/B       E
 For this I have Jesus, for this I have Jesus
.    G#m         C#m    A#m7(b5) C#m/B B7 E
 For this I have Jesus, I have   Je_____sus.

[V2]
 For the tears that flow in secret, in the broken times
 For the moments of elation, or the troubled mind
 For all the disappointments, or the sting of old regrets
 All my prayers and longings that seem unanswered yet

[V3]
 For the weakness of my body, the burdens of each day
 For the nights of doubt and worry when sleep has fled away
 Needing reassurance and the will to start again
 A steely eyed endurance, the strength to fight and win</lyrics></song>
