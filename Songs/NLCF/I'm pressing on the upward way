  <lyrics>[V1]
.             E             A
 I'm pressing on the upward way,
.                E             B 
 New heights I'm gaining every day;
.               E           A
 Still praying, as I onward bound,
.               E       B7     E
 "Lord plant my feet on higher ground."

[C]
.      B7      E             B
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
.             B7             E
 By faith, on heaven's table land;
.         E7                A
 A higher plane than I have found,
.      F#m       E      B7     E
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

[V2]
 My heart has no desire to stay
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
 Though some may dwell where these abound,
 My prayer, my aim is higher ground.

[V3]
 I want to live above the world,
 Though satan's darts at me are hurled;
 For faith has caught the joyful sound
 The song of saints on higher ground.

[V4]
 I want to scale the utmost height,
 And catch a gleam of glory bright;
 But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
 Lord, lead me on to higher ground.</lyrics></song>
