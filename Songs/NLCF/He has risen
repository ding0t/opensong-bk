.E      A/E E  B      A  E
 He has risen, he has risen
.E      A/E E  A     B   E
 He has risen, Jesus is alive    x2

[V1]
.B                             A/E   E
 When the life flowed from His body
.B                  A/E     E
 Seemed like Jesus' mission failed
.G#m                A           E/G#
 But His sacrifice accomplished
.F#m     A            Bsus4   B
 Victory over sin and hell

[V2]
 In the grave God did not leave Him 
 For His body to decay
 Raised to life the great awakening 
 Satan's power He overcame

[V3]
 If there were no resurrection 
 We ourselves could not be raised
 But the Son of God is living
 So our hope is not in vain

[V4]
 When the Lord rides out of heaven
 Mighty angels at His side
 They will sound the final trumpet
 From the grave we shall arise

[V5]
 He has given life immortal
 We shall see Him face to face
 Through eternity we'll praise Him
 Christ the champion of our faith</lyrics></song>
