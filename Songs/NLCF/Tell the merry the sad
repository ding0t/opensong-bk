.A7       D                       A7           D
 Tell the merry the sad, tell the good and the bad
.         G          D           A7
 Tell the captive as well as the free
.A7       D                            A7        D
 Tell the weak and the strong they may all come along
.       G              D   A7   D
 Just because of verse 16, John 3
.   A7         D    D/C  B7         Em
 Oh yes, I can see, whosoever means me
.    A7      D                  D        A7   D
 I’m ever so thankful, for that verse in John 3
	
[V2]	
.A7       D                          A7          D
 Tell the lass and the lad, tell the mum and the dad
.         G             D           A7
 Tell the short and the tall one as well
.A7       D                          A7        D     
 Tell the fat and the thin, they may all enter in
.            G               D         A7  D
 Through the door if they’re free from all sin
.     A7           D  D/C      B7          Em
 John 10 and verse 9, tells me all will be fine
.     A7            D            D      A7    D
 If I enter through Jesus, then eternal life’s mine
