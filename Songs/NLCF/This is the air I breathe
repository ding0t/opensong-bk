  <lyrics>[V1]
.A2          D2/A           A2          D2/A
 This is the air I breathe; This is the air I breathe:
.A2   E/G# F#m F#m/E D2  F#m   E
 Your holy presence  living in me.
.A2         D2/A         A2         D2/A
 This is my daily bread; This is my daily bread:
.A2   E/G# F#m F#m/E D2   F#m  E
 Your very word      spoken to me.

[C]
.    A E/G# F#m E               D      F#m E
 And I__________, I'm desperate for You,
.    A E/G# F#m E              D2     F#m E
 And I__________, I'm lost without You.

[V2]
.C2          F2/C           C2          F2/C

 Your holy presence living in me.
.C2         F2/C         C2         F2/C
 You are my daily bread; You are my daily bread:
.C2   G/B  Am Am/G F2 Am    G
 Your very word    spoken to me.

[C2]

 And I________, I'm lost without You.
