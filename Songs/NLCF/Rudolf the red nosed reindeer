.C                                               G
 Rudolf the red nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose
.                G7                             C
 And if you ever saw him, you would even say it glowed
.C                                                     G
 All of the other reindeer, used to laugh and call him names
.                              G7                   C   C7
 They wouldn't let poor Rudolf join in any reindeer games

.F              C/E            Dm7   G       C
 Then one snowy Christmas eve, santa came to say
.D                                                   G      G7
 Rudolf with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight
.C                                                       G
 Then all the other reindeer leaped and shouted out with glee
.                               G7                C    
 Rudolf the red nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history

;                      G7                               C      F    C  G   C     G C
;Last time :    you'll go down in history)
