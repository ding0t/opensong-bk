.G                     D/B
 I want to sit at Your feet Lord,
.Cmaj7/E                D/F#
 I want to look on Your face.
.G                  D/B
 I want to offer my life Lord,
.Cmaj7/E             D/F#
 I give it wholly to You.

[V1]
.C/G                  G
 Into Your presence I come Lord
.C/G                 G
 In Your arms I find rest
.C/G                         G
 The troubles of the world I leave behind
.  F       D/F#
 I come to You

[V2]
 In the shadow of Your wing Lord
 This is where I would stay
 Take my refuge from the storms that blow
 My Rock is there

[V3]
 There is beauty in Your presence Lord,
 This is where I long to be           
 In the presence of the One I love
 My Lord, I pray</lyrics></song>
