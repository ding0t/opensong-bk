  <lyrics>[1]
 Blessings and more blessings overtake me.
 All His commandments I observe
 While my soul doth prosper in the knowledge
 Of Jesus Christ my Lord the living Word...
 
[2]
 Blest have I been in the city
 Blest have I been in the field
 The Lord has commanded on me blessing
 It's my Fathers pleasure and His will...
 
[3]
 He blesses everything I set my hand to
 My enemies run from me seven ways
 The Lord has opened to me His good treasure
 While I observe and do what Jesus says...
 
[c]
 Thats what I have
 Thats who I am
 I am a King come out of Abraham
 Because of Christ
 I reign in life with Him
 Thats what I have
 Thats who I am
