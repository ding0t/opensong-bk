  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                 A         E
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.                         B7
 That saved a wretch like me
.  E                  A      E 
 I once was lost, but now am found
.    F#m       B7    A  E/G# F#m E (B7)
 Was blind but now I see

[V2]
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[V3]
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
 I have already come
 Twas grace that brought me safe thus far
 And grace will lead me home

[V4]
 When we've been there ten thousand years
 Bright as the shining sun
 We've no less days too sing God's praise
 Than when we first began</lyrics>
