  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God forgave my sin in Jesus' name,
 I've been born again in Jesus' name;
 And in Jesus' name I come to you
 To share His love as He told me to.
[C]
 He said: 'Freely, freely, you have received,
 Freely, freely give;
 Go in My name, and because you believe
 Others will know that I live.'
[V2]
 All power is given in Jesus' name,
 In earth and heaven in Jesus' name;
 And in Jesus' name I come to you
 To share His power as He told me to.
