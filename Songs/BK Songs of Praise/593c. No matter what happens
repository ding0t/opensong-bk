  <lyrics>[v1]
 No matter what happens  
 I'll praise you my Lord
 No matter what happened today
 No matter what happens 
 I'll praise you my Lord
 No matter what happened today
[v2]
 My mind is limited but my spirit is free
 Jesus is limitless he lives in me
 I open my heart wait for him to speak
 And listen to his gentle voice
 The one that I seek
[v3]
 I'll praise you and trust you today
