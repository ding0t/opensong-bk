  <lyrics>[v1]
 Lord, Your face so shines upon me,
 And Your love just floods my soul.
 And Your blessings rests upon me,
 Causing me to be made whole.
[v2]
 From my heart I want to thankyou,
 For the things you've done for me.
 And my love for You keeps growing,
 As You show Your self to me. </lyrics></song>
