  <lyrics>[1]
 The steps of a good man
 Are ordered by the Lord
 And he delighteth in his way
 Though he fall, though he fall
 He shall not be cast down
 For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
[2]
 With his hand, with his hand
 For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
 Though he fall, though he fall
 He shall not be cast down
 For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand</lyrics></song>
