  <lyrics>[1]
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord
 Make his paths straight
 Every valley shall be filled
 And every mountain and hill shall be brought low

[2]
 And the crooked shall be made staight
 And the rough ways shall be made smooth
 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God

[3]
 Sow to yourselves in righteousness
 Reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground
 For it is time to seek the Lord
 Till he come and rain rigteousness on you ..</lyrics></song>
