  <lyrics>[1]
 Lord I seek your righteousness
 Lord I seek your holinesss
 I come to you in brokenness
 To lay my life at your feet
[2]
 I long to see you face to face
 To stand in awe at your throne of grace
 Draw me to your lovely holy place
[3]
 And I will worship you
 Father God I worship you
 And I will worship you with all my heart
 And as I lift my hands
 I will lift your name on high
 And I will worship you with all my heart</lyrics></song>
