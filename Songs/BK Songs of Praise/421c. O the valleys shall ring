.      E             B             A        E
 O the valleys shall ring with the sound of praise
.        E          B            A  A/B
 And the lion shall lie with the lamb
.       E     B                A     E
 Of His government there shall be no end
.        E           D        E
 And His glory shall fill the earth

[C]
.         E       D              A       E
 May Your will be done, may Your kingdom come
.       E            D            A A/B
 Let it rule, let it reign in our lives
.          E            B          A          E
 There's a shout in the camp as we answer the call
.         E              D       E
 Hail the King, hail the Lord of Lords</lyrics></song>
