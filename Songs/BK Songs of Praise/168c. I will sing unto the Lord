  <title>168c. I will sing unto the Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
 I will sing unto the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously,
 The horse and rider thrown into the sea.
 I will sing unto the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously,
 The horse and rider thrown into the sea.

[2]
 The Lord my God, my strength, my song
 Is now become my victory
 The Lord my God, my strength, my song
 Is now become my victory

[3]
 The Lord is God and I will praise Him,
 My Father's God and I will exalt Him
 The Lord is God and I will praise Him,
 My Father's God and I will EXALT HIM!</lyrics>
