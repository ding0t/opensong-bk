 Praise ye the Lord
 Praise him from the heavens above
 Praise him all his angels
 Praise him all his hosts
[2]
 Praise ye him, O sun and moon
 Praise him all ye stars of light
 For his name is to be praised
 Praise ye the Lord
[3]
 Praise ye the Lord
 Praise him from the earth below
 Praise him all ye fruitful trees
 Mountains and all hills
[4]
 Praise ye the Lord 
 Praise ye him O people
 For his name is to be praised 
 Praise ye the Lord</lyrics></song>
