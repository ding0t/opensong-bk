  <lyrics>[1]
 I will make my life a psalm for you
 I will fill my lips from the cup of truth.
 King of life, I choose to walk your way.
 You alone are worthy of my days.
[c]
 You alone are worthy God
 Of power and glory
 You alone are worthy of my days
 You alone are worthy God
 Of power and glory
 You alone are worthy of my praise
[2]
 Take my feet to run the race for you
 Take my hands for love, take my whole heart too
 King of Love, I'm yours at work and play
 You alone are worthy of my days
[3]
 When you knock I'll open wide the door
 It's my heart's desire to sup with my Lord
 King of Light, I'll turn you not away,
 You alone are worthy of my days</lyrics>
