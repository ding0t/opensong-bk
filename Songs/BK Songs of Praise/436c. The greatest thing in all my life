[V1]
 The greatest thing in all my life is knowing You;
 The greatest thing in all my life is knowing You;
 I want to know You more;
 I want to know You more.
 The greatest thing in all my life is knowing You.
 
[V2]
 The greatest thing in all my life is loving You;
 The greatest thing in all my life is loving You;
 I want to love You more;
 I want to love You more.
 The greatest thing in all my life is loving You.
 
[V3]
 The greatest thing in all my life is serving You;
 The greatest thing in all my life is serving You;
 I want to serve You more;
 I want to serve You more.
 The greatest thing in all my life is serving You.
