  <lyrics>[1]
 When the Father sent his Son
 To live with us our lives to mend
 Placed his love upon the alter
 That with him we might ascend
[c]
 And all that I can do is thank him
 All that I can do is pray
 All that I can do is lift my hands
 To sing his praise
[2]
 Lord the blessed life you give me
 And the holy road you choose
 Lead me all the way to Calv'ry
 And I'll only follow you
[3]
 Lord I only want your blessing
 While I'm sitting at your feet
 Nothing in this world can woo me
 From your holy seat</lyrics>
