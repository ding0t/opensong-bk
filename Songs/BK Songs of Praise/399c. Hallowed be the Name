  <title>399c. Hallowed be the Name</title>
  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Hallowed be the name, of Jesus.
 Holy is the Lamb, Lord Jesus.
 Other kingdoms rise and fall,
 but you reigneth over all.
 Hallowed be the name of Jesus.

[V2]
 Precious is the blood, of Jesus.
 Blessed Son of God, Lord Jesus.
 You have washed away our sin,
 given grace to enter in.
 Precious is the blood of Jesus.

[V3]
 Worthy is the Lamb, Lord Jesus.
 Righteous I can stand, in Jesus.
 We were chained to death, but then
 You raised us up again.
 Worthy is the Lamb, Lord Jesus.
