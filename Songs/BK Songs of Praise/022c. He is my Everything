  <lyrics>[1]
 He is my everything
 He is my all
 He is my everything
 Both great and small
 He gave his life for me
 Made everything new
 He is my everything
 Now how about you
[2]
 Like honey in the rock
 Sweet honey in the rock
 For he tastes like honey in the rock
 O taste and see that the Lord is good
 For he tastes like honey in the rock</lyrics></song>
