  <lyrics>[V1]
  Arise Australia. together let us stand.
  March forth to conquer,  let the trumpet sound
  Right across this nation,  proclaim thru'out the land,
  Arise Australia, let's move at God's command.
 
[V2]
  Arise Australia,  it's time to make a stand,
  To win this battle, the keys are in your hand.
  Like a mighty army that marches forth to war,
  Arise Australia,  lets move from shore to shore.
 
[V3
  Move with great rejoicing,  The Word of God. our Sword,
  We have a mighty King  Jesus Christ the Lord!
  Right across the nation,  together make a stand.
  Arise Australia,  to take our promised land!
