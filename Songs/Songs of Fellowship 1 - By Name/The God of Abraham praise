[V1]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 Who reigns enthroned above,
 Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love.
 Jehovah! Great I AM!
 By earth and heaven confessed;
 I bow and bless the sacred name forever blessed.
[V2]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 At whose supreme command
 From earth I rise, and seek the joys at His right hand.
 I all on earth forsake,
 Its wisdom, fame, and power,
 And Him my only portion make, my shield and tower.
[V3]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 Whose all-sufficient grace
 Shall guide me all my happy days in all my ways.
 He calls a worm His friend,
 He calls Himself my God;
 And He shall save me to the end through Jesu's blood.
[V4]
 He by Himself hath sworn,
 I on His oath depend:
 I shall, on eagles' wings upborne, to heaven ascend;
 I shall behold His face,
 I shall His power adore,
 And sing the wonders of His grace forever more.
[V5]
 There dwells the Lord our King,
 The Lord our Righteousness,
 Triumphant o'er the world and sin, the Prince of Peace;
 On Zion's sacred height
 His kingdom still maintains,
 And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.
[V6]
 The God who reigns on high
 The great archangels sing;
 And, holy, holy, holy, cry, Almighty King.
 Who was and is the same,
 And ever more shall be;
 Jehovah, Father, Great I AM, we worship Thee.
[V7]
 Before the Saviour's face
 The ransomed nations bow;
 O'erwhelmed at His almighty grace, forever new:
 He shows His prints of love,
 They kindle to a flame,
 And sound through all the worlds above the slaughtered Lamb.
[V8]
 The whole triumphant host
 Give thanks to God on high;
 Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! They ever cry.
 Hail, Abraham's God, and mine!
 I join the heavenly lays;  
 All might and majesty are Thine, and endless praise.
