[V1]
 We are being built into a temple,
 Fit for God's own dwelling place;
 Into the house of God which is the church,
 The pillar and the ground of truth,
 As precious stones that Jesus owns,
 Fashioned by His wondrous grace.
 And as we love and trust each other
 So the building grows and grows. 
  </lyrics></song>
