[V1]
 Lord we come in Your name,
 Gathered here to worship You.
 Join us all in harmony,
 Spirit, come.
[C]
 And join our hearts together in love, (men)
 Join our hearts together in love, (women)
 Join our hearts together in love, (men)
 Join our hearts, (women)
 And come like the dew on the mountains descending. (all)
 ||Join our hearts together in love, (men)
 Join our hearts together in love, (women)
 Join our hearts together in love, (men)
 Join our hearts, (women)
 For there the Lord has commanded the blessing. (all)
[V2]
 O how good, how beautiful
 When we live in unity; (women)
 Flowing like anointing oil
 On Jesus' head. (men)
[V3]
 So let us all agree
 To make strong our bonds of peace.
 Here is life forever more,
 Spirit, come.
