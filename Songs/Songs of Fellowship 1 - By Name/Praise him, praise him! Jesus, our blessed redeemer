[V1]
 Praise him, praise him! Jesus, our blessed redeemer; 
 Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim! 
 Hail Him, hail Him! highest archangels in glory, 
 Strength and honour give to His holy name. 
 ||Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children, 
 In His arms He carries them all day long; 
 O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion, 
 Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.
[V2]
 Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; 
 For our sins He suffered and bled and died. 
 He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation, 
 Hail Him, hail Him! Jesus the Crucified. 
 ||Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow, 
 Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow; 
 Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken, 
 Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.
[V3]
 Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; 
 Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring! 
 Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever, 
 Crown Him, crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King! 
 ||Death is vanquished, tell it with joy, ye faithful! 
 Where is now thy victory, boasting grave? 
 Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless; 
 Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.
