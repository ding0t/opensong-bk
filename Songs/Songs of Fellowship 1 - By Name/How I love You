[C1]
 How I love You,
 You are the One,
 You are the One.
 How I love You,
 You are the One for me.
[V1]
 I was so lost,
 But You showed the way,
 'Cause You are the Way.
 I was so lost,
 But You showed the way to me!
[V2]
 I was lied to,
 But You told the truth,
 'Cause You are the Truth.
 I was lied to,
 But You showed the truth to me!
[V3]
 I was dying,
 But You gave me life,
 'Cause You are the Life.
 I was dying,
 And You gave Your life for me!
[C2]
 How I love You,
 You are the One,
 You are the One.
 How I love You,
 You are the One,
 God's risen Son.
 You are the One for me!
[V4]
 Hallelujah!
 You are the One,
 You are the One.
 Hallelujah!
 You are the One for me!
