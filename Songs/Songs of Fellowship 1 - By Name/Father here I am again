  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father here I am again,
 In need of mercy, hurt from sin,
 So by the blood and Jesus' love,
 Let forgiveness flow.
[C]
 To me, from me,
 So my heart will know;
 Fully and sweetly,
 Let forgiveness flow.
[V2]
 In my heart and in my mind,
 In word and deed, I've been so blind,
 So by the blood and Jesus' love,
 Let forgiveness flow.
