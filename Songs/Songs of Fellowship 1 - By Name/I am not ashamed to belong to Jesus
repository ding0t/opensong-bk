  <lyrics>
[C1]
 I am not ashamed to belong to Jesus;
 I am not afraid to stand my ground,
 For there is no higher cause
 Than working for the King.
 To Him I lift my praise,
 For I am not ashamed.
[V1]
 Whom then shall I fear?
 What shall daunt my spirit?
 Sure and steadfast, anchored firm to the cross,
 Standing with my brothers,
 Serving God and others.
 Though the world may ridicule, I'll still say:
[V2]
 At the King's returning,
 Every soul will know Him,
 All creation shall bow down to His name;
 Brothers all, together
 Serving Him forever,
 He who gave His life for me, I will praise:
[C2]
 We are not ashamed to belong to Jesus,
 We are not afraid to stand our ground,
 For there is no higher cause
 Than working for the King.
 To Him we lift our praise,
 For we are not ashamed.
