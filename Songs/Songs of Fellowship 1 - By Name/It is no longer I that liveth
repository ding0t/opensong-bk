[V1]
 It is no longer I that liveth
 But Christ that liveth in me,
 It is no longer I that liveth
 But Christ that liveth in me.
 He lives, He lives,
 Jesus is alive in me.
 It is no longer I that liveth
 But Christ that liveth in me.
[V2]
 The life that I live in the body
 I live by faith in the Son.
 The life that I live in the body
 I live by faith in the Son.
 He loves, He loves,
 Jesus gave Himself for me.
 The life that I live in the body
 I live by faith in the Son.
