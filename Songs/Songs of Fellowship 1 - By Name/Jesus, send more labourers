[V1]
 Jesus, send more labourers,
 For, Lord, we see the need;
 The land is ready for harvest,
 The fields are ripe indeed.
[C]
 Oh Lord, but start with me,
 Jesus, begin with me.
 Who will go for You, Lord?
 Who will go for You, Lord?
 Here I am, Lord,
 Send me,
 Send me, Lord,
 Send me.
[V2]
 Lord, we love our country,
 Countless lives to be won;
 Jesus, bring revival,
 That through us Your will be done.
[V3]
 Lord, we sense Your moving,
 Touching our lives with power;
 We are ready to serve You,
 To go this day, this hour.
