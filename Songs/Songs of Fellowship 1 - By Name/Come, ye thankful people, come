[V1]
 Come, ye thankful people, come,
 Raise the song of harvest home!
 All is safely gathered in
 Ere the winter storms begin;
 God, our Maker, doth provide
 For our needs to be supplied;
 Come to God's own temple, come,
 Raise the song of harvest-home.
[V2]
 All the world is God's own field,
 Fruit unto His praise to yield;
 Wheat and tares together sown,
 Unto joy or sorrow grown;
 First the blade, and then the ear,
 Then the full corn shall appear:
 Lord of harvest, grant that we
 Wholesome grain and pure may be.
[V3]
 For the Lord our God shall come
 And shall take His harvest home,
 From His field shall in that day
 All offences purge away,
 Give His angels charge at last
 In the fire the tares to cast,
 But the fruitful ears to store
 In His garner evermore.
[V4]
 Even so, Lord, quickly come,
 Bring Thy final harvest home;
 Gather Thou Thy people in,
 Free from sorrow, free from sin;
 There, forever purified,
 In Thy garner to abide:
 Come, with all Thine angels, come,
 Raise the glorious harvest-home.
