  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I want to serve the purpose of God
 In my generation.
 I want to serve the purpose of God
 While I am alive.
 I want to give my life
 For something that will last forever.
 Oh, I delight, I delight to do Your will.
[C]
 What is on Your heart?
 Tell me what to do;
 Let me know Your will
 And I will follow You.
   (Repeat)
[V2]
 I want to build with silver and gold
 In my generation.
 I want to build with silver and gold
 While I am alive.
 I want to give my life
 For something that will last forever.
 Oh, l delight, I delight to do Your will.
[V3]
 I want to see the kingdom of God
 In my generation.
 I want to see the kingdom of God
 While I am alive.
 I want to live my life
 For something that will last forever.
 Oh, I delight, I delight to do Your will.
[V4]
 I want to see the Lord come again
 In my generation.
 I want to see the Lord come again
 While I am alive.
 I want to give my life
 For something that will last forever.
 Oh l delight, I delight to do Your will.
