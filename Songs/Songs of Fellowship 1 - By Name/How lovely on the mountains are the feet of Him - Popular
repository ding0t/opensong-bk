[V1]
 How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
 Who brings good news, good news,
 Proclaiming peace, announcing news of happiness,
 Our God reigns, our God reigns.
[C]
 Our God reigns, our God reigns,
 Our God reigns, our God reigns.
[V2]
 You watchmen lift your voices joyfully asone,
 Shout for your King, your King.
 See eye to eye the Lord restoring Zion:
 Your God reigns, your God reigns!
[V3]
 Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy,
 We are redeemed, redeemed.
 The Lord has saved and comforted His people:
 Your God reigns, your God reigns!
[V4]
 Ends of the earth, see the salvation of your God,
 Jesus is Lord, is Lord.
 Before the nations He has bared His holy arm:
 Your God reigns, your God reigns!
