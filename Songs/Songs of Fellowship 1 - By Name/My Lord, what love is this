[V1]
 My Lord, what love is this 
 That pays so dearly, 
 That I, the guilty one,
 May go free!
[C1]
 Amazing love, O what sacrifice, 
 The Son of God given for me. 
 My debt He pays, and my death Hedies, 
 That I might live, that I might live. 
[V2]
 And so they watched Him die, 
 Despised, rejected; 
 But oh, the blood He shed
 Flowed for me!
[V3]
 And now, this love of Christ 
 Shall flow like rivers; 
 Come wash your guilt away, 
 Live again! 
[C2]
 Amazing love, O what sacrifice, 
 The Son of God given for me. 
 My debt He pays, and my death Hedies, 
 That I might live, that I might live. 
 That I might live!
