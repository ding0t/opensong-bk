[V1]
 In heavenly armour we'll enter the land,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
[C]
 And we sing glory, honour,
 Power and strength to the Lord.
 We sing glory, honour,
 Power and strength to the Lord.
[V2]
 When the power of darkness comes in like a flood,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
[V3]
 When your enemy presses in hard, do not fear,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near.
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
