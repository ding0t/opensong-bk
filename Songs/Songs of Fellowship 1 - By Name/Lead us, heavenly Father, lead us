[V1]
 Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
 O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
 Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
 For we have no help but Thee;
 Yet possessing every blessing
 If our God our Father be.
[V2]
 Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us;
 All our weakness Thou dost know,
 Thou didst tread this earth before us,
 Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
 Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted,
 Through the desert Thou didst go.
[V3]
 Spirit of our God, descending,
 Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
 Love with every passion blending,
 Pleasure that can never cloy;
 Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
 Nothing can our peace destroy.
