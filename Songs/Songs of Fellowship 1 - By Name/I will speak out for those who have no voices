  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will speak out for those who have no voices,
 I will stand up for the rights of all the oppressed;
 I will speak truth and justice,
 I'll defend the poor and the needy,
 I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.
[V2]
 I will speak out for those who have no choices,
 I will cry out for those who live without love;
 I will show God's compassion
 To the crushed and broken in spirit,
 I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.
