[C]
 Awake, awake, O Zion,
 Come clothe yourself with strength.
 Awake, awake, O Zion,
 Come clothe yourself with strength.
[V1]
 Put on your garments of splendour,
 O Jerusalem.
 Come sing your songs of joy and triumph,
 See that your God reigns.
[V2]
 Burst into songs of joy together,
 O Jerusalem.
 The Lord has comforted His people,
 The redeemed Jerusalem.
