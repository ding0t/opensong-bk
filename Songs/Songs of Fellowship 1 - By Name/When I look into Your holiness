  <lyrics>
[V1]
 When I look into Your holiness,
 When I gaze into Your loveliness,
 When all things that surround
 Become shadows in the light of You;
[V2]
 When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart,
 When my will becomes enthralled in Your love,
 When all things that surround
 Become shadows in the light of You:
[C]
 I worship You, I worship You,
 The reason I live is to worship You.
 I worship You, I worship You,
 The reason I live is to worship You.
