[V1]
 Lord, You're faithful and just,
 In You I put my trust, mighty God,
 Everlasting Father.
 Your word is faithful and true,
 What You promised You will do, oh Lord.
 Your word endures for ever.
[V2]
 You're faithful, faithful, and Your mercy never ends;
 The world will pass away, but Your words are here to stay.
 You're wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God.
 Lord Jehovah, You are the great I AM.
