  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We are Your people who are called by Your name.
 We call upon You now to declare Your fame.
 In this nation of darkness You've called us to be light.
 As we seek Your face, Lord, stir up Your might.
[V2]
 Build Your church and heal this land,
 Let Your kingdom come.
 Build Your church and heal this land,
 Let Your will be done.
