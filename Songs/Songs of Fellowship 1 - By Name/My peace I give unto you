  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My peace I give unto you, 
 It's a peace that the world cannot give, 
 It's a peace that the world cannot understand:
 Peace to know, peace to live, 
 My peace I give unto you.
[V2]
 My joy I give unto you, 
 It's a joy that the world cannot give, 
 It's a joy that the world cannot understand:
 Joy to know, joy to live, 
 My joy I give unto you.
[V3]
 My love I give unto you, 
 It's a love that the world cannot give, 
 It's a love that the world cannot understand:
 Love to know, love to live, 
 My love I give unto you.
