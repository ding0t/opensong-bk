[V1]
 Draw me closer, Lord,
 Draw me closer, dear Lord,
 So that I might touch You,
 So that I might touch You,
 Lord, I want to touch You.
[V2]
 Touch my eyes, Lord,
 Touch my eyes, dear Lord,
 So that I might see You,
 So that I might see You,
 Lord, I want to see You:
[C]
 Your glory and Your love,
 Your glory and Your love,
 Your glory and Your love,
 And Your majesty.
