[C]
 Jesus, we celebrate Your victory:
 Jesus, we revel in Your love.
 Jesus, we rejoice, You've set us free;
 Jesus, Your death has brought us life.
[V1]
 It was for freedom that Christ has set us free,
 No longer to be subject to a yoke of slavery;
 So we're rejoicing in God's victory,
 Our hearts responding to His love.
[V2]
 His Spirit in us releases us from fear,
 The way to Him is open, with boldness we draw near;
 And in His presence our problems disappear,
 Our hearts responding to His love.
