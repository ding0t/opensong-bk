[C]
 All things bright and beautiful,
 All creatures great and small,
 All things wise and wonderful,
 The Lord God made them all.
[V1]
 Each little flower that opens,
 Each little bird that sings,
 He made their glowing colours,
 He made their tiny wings.
[V2]
 The purple-headed mountain,
 The river running by,
 The sunset, and the morning
 That brightens up the sky.
[V3]
 The cold wind in the winter,
 The pleasant summer sun,
 The ripe fruits in the garden,
 He made them every one.
[V4]
 He gave us eyes to see them,
 And lips that we might tell
 How great is God Almighty,
 Who has made all things well.
