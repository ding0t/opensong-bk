  <lyrics>
[C]
 Do something new, Lord,
 In my heart, make a start;
 Do something new, Lord,
 Do something new.
[V1]
 I open up my heart,
 As much as can be known;
 I open up my will
 To conform to Yours alone.
[V2]
 I lay before Your feet
 All my hopes and desires;
 Unreservedly submit
 To what Your Spirit may require.
[V3]
 I only want to live
 For Your pleasure now;
 I long to please You, Father -
 Will You show me how?
