[V1]
 We have come into this place
 And gathered in His name to worship Him,
 We have come into this place
 And gathered in His name to worship Him,
 ||We have come into this place
 And gathered in His name
 To worship Christ the Lord,
 Worship Him, Christ the Lord.
[V2]
 So forget about yourself
 And concentrate on Him and worship Him,
 So forget about yourself
 And concentrate on Him and worship Him,
 ||So forget about yourself
 And concentrate on Him
 And worship Christ the Lord,
 Worship Him, Christ the Lord.
[V3]
 He is all my righteousness,
 I stand complete in Him and worship Him,
 He is all my righteousness,
 I stand complete in Him and worship Him,
 ||He is all my righteousness,
 I stand complete in Him
 And worship Christ the Lord,
 Worship Him, Christ the Lord.
[V4]
 Let us lift up holy hands
 And magnify His name and worship Him,
 Let us lift up holy hands
 And magnify His name and worship Him,
 ||Let us lift up holy hands
 And magnify His name
 And worship Christ the Lord,
 Worship Him, Christ the Lord.
