[V1]
 How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
 O Lord of hosts,
 My soul longs and yearns for Your courts,
 And my heart and flesh sing for joy
 To the living God.
 ||One day in Your presence
 Is far better to me than gold,
 Or to live my whole life somewhere else;
 And I would rather be
 A doorkeeper in Your house
 Than to take my fate upon myself.
 ||You are my sun and my shield,
 You are my lover from the start,
 And the highway to Your city
 Runs through my heart.
