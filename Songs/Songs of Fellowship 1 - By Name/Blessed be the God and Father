[V1]
 Blessed be the God and Father
 Of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
 In heavenly places in Christ.
[V2]
 And He has chosen us
 Before the world was formed
 To be holy and blameless before Him.
 In His love He has predestined us
 To be adopted as sons
 Through Jesus Christ to Himself.
