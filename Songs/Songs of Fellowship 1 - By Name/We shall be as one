  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We shall be as one,
 We shall be as one,
 He the Father of us all,
 We His chosen sons;
 And by His command
 Take each other's hand,
 Live our lives in unity,
 We shall be as one.
[V2]
 We shall be as one,
 We shall be as one;
 And by this shall all men know
 Of the work He has done.
 Love will take us on
 Through His precious Son;
 Love of Him who first loved us,
 We shall be as one.
