[V1]
 Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
 In lowly pomp ride on to die! 
 O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin 
 O'er captive death and conquered sin.
[V2]
 Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
 Hark all the tribes 'hosanna' cry; 
 Thine humble beast pursues his road 
 With palms and scattered garments strowed.
[V3]
 Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
 Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh; 
 The Father on His sapphire throne 
 Expects His own anointed Son.
[V4]
 Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
 In lowly pomp ride on to die! 
 Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain, 
 Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign!
