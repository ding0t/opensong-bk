[V1]
 So freely, 
 Flows the endless love You give to me; 
 So freely, 
 Not dependent on my part. 
 As I am reaching out 
 Reveal the love within Your heart, 
 As I am reaching out 
 Reveal the love within Your heart.
[V2]
 Completely, 
 That's the way You give Your love to me;
 Completely, 
 Not dependent on my part. 
 As I am reaching out 
 Reveal the love within Your heart, 
 As I am reaching out 
 Reveal the love within Your heart.
[V3]
 So easy,
 I receive the love You give to me;
 So easy,
 Not dependent on my part.
 Flowing out to me
 The love within Your heart,
 Flowing out to me
 The love within Your heart.
