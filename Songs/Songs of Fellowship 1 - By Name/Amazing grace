[V1]
 Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me;
 I once was lost, but now am found,
 Was blind, but now I see.
[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 And grace my fears relieved;
 How precious did that grace appear,
 The hour I first believed!
[V3]
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
 I have already come;
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
 And grace will lead me home.
[V4]
 The Lord has promised good to me,
 His word my hope secures;
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures.
[V5]
 Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,
 And mortal life shall cease,
 I shall possess within the veil
 A life of joy and peace.
[V6]
 When we've been there a thousand years,
 Bright shining as the sun,
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 Than when we first begun.
