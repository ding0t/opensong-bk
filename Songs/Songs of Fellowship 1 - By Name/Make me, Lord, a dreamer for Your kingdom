  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom;
 Plant in my heart heavenly desires.
 Grant faith that can say, impossibilities shall be,
 And vision lest a world should perish not knowing Thee.
[V2]
 Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom;
 I would aspire to greater goals in God.
 So cause faith to rise, to motivate each word and deed,
 A faith that's well convinced that Jesus meets every need.
[V3]
 Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom,
 Dreams that will change a world that's lost its way.
 May dreams that first found their birth in Your omnipotence,
 Come alive in me, becoming reality.
