[V1]
 Make a joyful melody,
 Join together in harmony,
 We are a part of a family,
 The family of God.
[V2]
 His Spirit is our guarantee
 That He lives in you and me,
 We are a part of a family,
 The family of God.
[V3]
 Lord, we praise You, praise You,
 Your love is great!
 Lord, we praise You, praise You,
 We celebrate!
