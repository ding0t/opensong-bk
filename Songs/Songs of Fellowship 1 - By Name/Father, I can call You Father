  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father, I can call You Father,
 For I am Your child today,
 Tomorrow and always,
 You are my Father.
[V2]
 Father, how I love You, Father,
 I will sing Your praise today,
 Tomorrow and always,
 For You're my Father.
[C]
 Father, Father,
 Father to me.
 Father, holy Father,
 Father to me.
[V3]
 Father, I will serve You, Father,
 I will seek Your face today,
 Tomorrow and always,
 You are my Father.
