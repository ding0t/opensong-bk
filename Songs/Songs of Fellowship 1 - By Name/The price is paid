[V1]
 The price is paid,
 Come let us enter in
 To all that Jesus died
 To make our own.
 For every sin
 More than enough He gave,
 And bought our freedom
 From each guilty stain.
[V2]
 The price is paid,
 Alleluia,
 Amazing grace,
 So strong and sure;
 And so with all my heart,
 My life in every part,
 I live to thank You for
 The price You paid.
[V3]
 The price is paid,
 See Satan flee away;
 For Jesus crucified
 Destroys his power.
 No more to pay,
 Let accusation cease,
 In Christ there is
 No condemnation now.
[V4]
 The price is paid,
 And by that scourging cruel
 He took our sicknesses
 As if His own.
 And by His wounds,
 His body broken there,
 His healing touch may now
 By faith be known.
[V5]
 The price is paid,
 'Worthy the Lamb' we cry,
 Eternity shall never
 Cease His praise.
 The church of Christ
 Shall rule upon the earth,
 In Jesus' name we have
 Authority.
