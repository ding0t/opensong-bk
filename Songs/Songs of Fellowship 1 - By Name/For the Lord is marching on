  <lyrics>
[V1]
 For the Lord is marching on,
 And His army is ever strong;
 And His glory shall be seen upon our land.
 Raise the anthem, sing the victor's song;
 Praise the Lord for the battle's won.
 No weapon formed against us shall stand.
[C]
 For the Captain of the host is Jesus;
 We're following in His footsteps.
 No foe can stand against us in the fray.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 We are marching in Messiah's band,
 The keys of victory in His mighty hand;
 Let us march on to take our promised land!
 For the Lord is marching on,
 And His army is ever strong;
 And His glory shall be seen upon our land.
