[V1]
 Ye holy angels bright, 
 Who wait at God's right hand, 
 Or through the realms of light 
 Fly at your Lord's command, 
 Assist our song, 
 Or else the theme too high 
 Doth seem for mortal tongue.
[V2]
 Ye blessed souls at rest, 
 Who see your Saviour's face, 
 Whose glory, e'en the least 
 Is far above our grace, 
 God's praises sound, 
 As in His sight 
 With sweet delight 
 Ye do abound.
[V3]
 Ye saints who toil below, 
 Adore your heavenly King, 
 And onward as ye go, 
 Some joyful anthem sing; 
 Take what He gives, 
 And praise Him still 
 Through good and ill, 
 Who ever lives.
[V4]
 My soul, bear thou thy part, 
 Triumph in God above, 
 And with a well-tuned heart 
 Sing thou the songs of love. 
 Let all thy days 
 Till life shall end, 
 Whate'er He send, 
 Be filled with praise.
