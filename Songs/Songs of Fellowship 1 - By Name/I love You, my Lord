  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I love You, my Lord,
 For giving to me Your great salvation,
 Setting me free from sin and death
 And the kingdom of Satan's destruction.
 ||There's power in the blood
 To cleanse all my sin, I know I'm forgiven;
 I'm reigning in life, I'm living by faith,
 I'm now united with Christ.
[V2]
 I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
 Jesus is Lord, and believe in my heart
 He's been raised from the dead.
 I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
 Jesus is Lord, and now I have life,
 Now I have life by the Spirit of God.
[V3]
 I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
 And believe in my heart
 He's been raised from the dead.
 I confess with my mouth that Jesus is my Lord,
 And now I have life by the Spirit of God.
