  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Faithful One, so unchanging,
 Ageless One, You're my Rock of peace.
 Lord of all, I depend on You,
 I call out to You again and again.
 I call out to You again and again.
[V2]
 You are my rock in times of trouble.
 You lift me up when I fall down.
 All through the storm Your love is the anchor,
 My hope is in You alone.
