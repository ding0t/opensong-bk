[C]
 You make my heart feel glad. 
 You make my heart feel glad. 
 Jesus, You bring me joy; 
 You make my heart feel glad.
[V1]
 Lord, Your love brings healing and a peace into my heart, 
 I want to give myself in praise to You. 
 Though I've been through heartache 
 You have understood my tears, 
 O Lord, I will give thanks to You.
[V2]
 When I look around me, and I see the life You made,
 All creation shouts aloud in praise;
 I realise Your greatness, how majestic is Your name,
 O Lord, I love You more each day.
