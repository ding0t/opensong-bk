[C]
 O, we are more than conquerors. 
 O, we are more than conquerors, 
 And who can separate us from 
 The love, the love of God?
 O yes, we are, 
 We are more than conquerors. 
 O, we are more than conquerors.
[V1]
 For He has promised to fulfil His will in us, 
 He said that He would guide us with His eye; 
 For He has blessed us with all gifts in Christ, 
 And we are His delight.
[V2]
 For He's within to finish what's begun in me, 
 He opens doors that no one can deny; 
 He makes a way where there's no other way, 
 And gives me wings to fly.
