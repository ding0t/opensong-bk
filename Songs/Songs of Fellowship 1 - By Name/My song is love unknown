[V1]
 My song is love unknown,
 My Saviour's love to me: 
 Love to the loveless shown, 
 That they might lovely be. 
 O who am I, that for my sake 
 My Lord should take frail flesh and die?
[V2]
 He came from His blessed throne,
 Salvation to bestow; 
 But men made strange, and none 
 The longed-for Christ would know: 
 But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed, 
 Who at my need His life did spend.
[V3]
 Sometimes they strew His way, 
 And His sweet praises sing; 
 Resounding all the day 
 Hosannas to their King: 
 Then 'Crucify!' is all their breath, 
 And for His death they thirst and cry.
[V4]
 They rise and needs will have 
 My dear Lord made away; 
 A murderer they save, 
 The Prince of life they slay, 
 Yet cheerful He to suffering goes, 
 That He His foes from thence might free.
[V5]
 In life no house, no home 
 My Lord on earth might have; 
 In death, no friendly tomb, 
 But what a stranger gave. 
 What may I say? Heaven was His home; 
 And mine the tomb wherein He lay.
[V6]
 Here might I stay and sing, 
 No story so divine; 
 Never was love, dear King! 
 Never was grief like Thine. 
 This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise 
 I all my days could gladly spend.
