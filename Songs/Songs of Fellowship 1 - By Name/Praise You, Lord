[V1]
 Praise You, Lord, 
 For the wonder of Your healing.
 Praise You, Lord, 
 For Your love so freely given; 
 Outpouring, anointing, 
 Flowing in to heal our wounds:
 Praise You, Lord, for Your love for me.
[V2]
 Praise You, Lord, 
 For Your gift of liberation.
 Praise You, Lord, 
 You have set the captives free; 
 The chains that bind are broken 
 By the sharpness of Your sword:
 Praise You, Lord, You gave Your life for me.
[V3]
 Praise You, Lord, 
 You have borne the depths of sorrow.
 Praise You, Lord, 
 For Your anguish on the tree; 
 The nails that tore Your body 
 And the pain that tore Your soul:
 Praise You, Lord, Your tears they fell for me.
[V4]
 Praise You, Lord, 
 You have turned our thorns to roses.
 Glory, Lord, 
 As they bloom upon Your brow; 
 The path of pain is hallowed, 
 For Your love has made it sweet:
 Praise You, Lord, and may I love You now.
