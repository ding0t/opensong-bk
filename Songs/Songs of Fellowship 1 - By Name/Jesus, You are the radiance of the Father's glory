[V1]
 Jesus, You are the radiance of the Father's glory,
 You are the Son, the appointed heir,
 Through whom all things are made.
 You are the One who sustains all things by Your powerful word.
 ||You have purified us from sin,
 You are exalted, O Lord,
 Exalted, O Lord,
 To the right hand of God.
[V2]
 Crowned with glory,
 Crowned with honour,
 We worship You.
