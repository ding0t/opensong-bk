  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Love came down at Christmas,
 Love all lovely, Love divine;
 Love was born at Christmas,
 Star and angels gave the sign.
[V2]
 Worship we the Godhead,
 Love Incarnate, Love divine;
 Worship we our Jesus:
 But wherewith for sacred sign?
[V3]
 Love shall be our token,
 Love be yours and love be mine,
 Love to God and all men,
 Love for plea and gift and sign. 
  </lyrics></song>
