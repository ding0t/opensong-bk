  <lyrics>
[V1]
 He holds the key to salvation,
 Jesus is over all.
 He is the Lord of creation:
[C]
 Allelu, alleluia.
 Allelu, alleluia, Lord.
[V2]
 He is the Rock ever standing,
 No man could break Him down.
 He is the Truth everlasting:
[V3]
 He is a Light in the darkness,
 All men shall see His face.
 He breaks all chains to redeem us:
[V4]
 All power to Him who is mighty,
 All praise to Him who is God.
 All glory now and for ever:
