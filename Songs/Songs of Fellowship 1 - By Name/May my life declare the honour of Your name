  <lyrics>
[V1]
 May my life declare the honour of Your name,
 Reveal the heart of Christ who came
 To light the darkest place
 With sacrificial love.
 (Last time)
 Sacrificial love.
[V2]
 Cause me, Lord, to reach out in the Father's name,
 To glorify the Lamb once slain,
 To light the darkest place
 With sacrificial love.
[V3]
 Teach me, Lord, to make my life as an offering,
 To tell the world that Jesus Christ is King,
 For the glory of God.
