[C]
 We are in God's army,
 We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 We are in God's army,
 Glorie, Glorie, Glorie,
 The Glorie Company.
[V1]
 The enemy's attacking, convinced he's gaining ground,
 But the only voice that he can hear is the one he shouts around;
 But we're not fooled by his lies, we know that he is wrong;
 We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
[V2]
 The enemy's regrouping, as he tries another plan,
 He can't pick off an army but he can pick out a man;
 So we'll stay close together, and sing this battle-song;
 We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
[V3]
 The enemy's realising that his future's looking poor,
 Though he loves single combat, he's already lost the war;
 United, not divided, together we belonG;
 We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
