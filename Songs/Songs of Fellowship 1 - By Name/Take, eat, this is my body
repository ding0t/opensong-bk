  <lyrics>
[C]
 Take, eat, this is my body, 
 Broken for you, 
 For I am come that you might have life;
 Eat of My flesh and live, 
 Eat of My flesh and live.
[V1]
 My blood was shed for many, 
 Taking away your sin, 
 And if I shall make you free 
 Then you shall be free indeed, 
 You shall be free indeed.
[V2]
 Though your sins be as scarlet 
 They shall be white as snow, 
 Though they be red like crimson 
 They shall be as wool, 
 They shall be as wool.
[V3]
 For God so loved the world
 He gave His only Son,
 That whosoever believeth on Him
 Might have everlasting life,
 Might have everlasting life.
