[V1]
 Jesus lives! thy terrors now
 Can, O death, no more appal us;
 Jesus lives! by this we know,
 Thou, O grave, canst not enthral us.
 Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Jesus lives! henceforth is death
 But the gate of life immortal;
 This shall calm our trembling breath,
 When we pass its gloomy portal.
 Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Jesus lives! for us He died;
 Then, alone to Jesus living,
 Pure in heart may we abide,
 Glory to our Saviour giving.
 Hallelujah!
[V4]
 Jesus lives! our hearts know well,
 Naught from us His love shall sever;
 Life, nor death, nor powers of hell,
 Tear us from His keeping ever.
 Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Jesus lives! to Him the throne
 Over all the world is given:
 May we go where He is gone,
 Rest and reign with Him in heaven.
 Hallelujah!
