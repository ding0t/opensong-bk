  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are compassionate and gracious, 
 Patient and abounding in love; 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 You took the sins we were guilty of. 
 And You deal tenderly with us, 
 And You deal tenderly with us.
[V2]
 And higher than the heavens, 
 So great is Your love; 
 Yes, higher than the heavens 
 Is Your love for us.
