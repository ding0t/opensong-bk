[V1]
 Christ the Lord is risen today 
 Hallelujah!
 Sons of men and angels say 
 Hallelujah!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high 
 Hallelujah!
 Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply 
 Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Love's redeeming work is done
 Hallelujah!
 Fought the fight, the battle won
 Hallelujah!
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal
 Hallelujah!
 Christ hath burst the gates of hell
 Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Lives again our glorious King
 Hallelujah!
 Where, O death, is now thy sting? 
 Hallelujah!
 Once He died, our souls to save
 Hallelujah!
 Where thy victory, O grave
 Hallelujah!
[V4]
 Soar we now where Christ hath led
 Hallelujah!
 Following our exalted Head
 Hallelujah!
 Made like Him, like Him we rise
 Hallelujah!
 Ours the cross, the grave, the skies
 Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Hail the Lord of earth and heaven
 Hallelujah!
 Praise to Thee by both be given
 Hallelujah!
 Thee we greet, in triumph sing
 Hallelujah!
 Hail our resurrected King
 Hallelujah!
