  <lyrics>
[V1]
 As we seek Your face,
 May we know Your heart,
 Feel Your presence, acceptance,
 As we seek Your face.
[V2]
 Move among us now,
 Come reveal Your power,
 Show Your presence, acceptance,
 Move among us now.
[V3]
 At Your feet we fall,
 Sovereign Lord,
 We cry 'holy, holy',
 At Your feet we fall.
