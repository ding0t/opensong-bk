[V1]
 Lord, You put a tongue in my mouth
 And I want to sing to You.
 Lord, You put a tongue in my mouth
 And I want to sing to You.
 ||Lord, You put a tongue in my mouth
 And I want to sing only to You.
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise;
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise.
[V2]
 Lord, You put some hands on my arms
 Which I want to raise to You.
 Lord, You put some hands on my arms
 Which I want to raise to You.
 ||Lord, You put some hands on my arms
 Which I want to raise only to You.
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise;
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise.
[V3]
 Lord, You put some feet on my legs
 And I want to dance to You.
 Lord, You put some feet on my legs
 And I want to dance to You.
 ||Lord, You put some feet on my legs
 And I want to dance only to You.
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise;
 Lord Jesus, free us in our praise.
