  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father God, I wonder 
 how I managed to exist
 Without the knowledge of Your parenthood 
 and Your loving care.
 ||But now I am Your son, 
 I am adopted in Your family,
 And I can never be alone,
 'Cause Father God, You're there beside me.
[C]
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises,
 Forever more.
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises,
 Forever more.
