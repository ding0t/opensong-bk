[V1]
 O come, all ye faithful, 
 Joyful and triumphant, 
 O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
 Come and behold Him, 
 Born the King of angels;
[C]
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ the Lord!
[V2]
 God of God, 
 Light of light, 
 Lo, He abhors not the virgin's womb; 
 Very God, 
 Begotten, not created:
[V3]
 Sing, choirs of angels, 
 Sing in exultation, 
 Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above; 
 Glory to God 
 In the highest:
[V4]
 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, 
 Born this happy morning, 
 Jesus, to Thee be glory given; 
 Word of the Father 
 Now in flesh appearing:
