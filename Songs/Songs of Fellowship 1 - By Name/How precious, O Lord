[V1]
 How precious, O Lord,
 Is Your unfailing love,
 We find refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
 We feast, Lord Jesus, on the abundance of Your house
 And drink from Your river of delights.
 ||With You is the fountain of life,
 In Your light we see light.
 With You is the fountain of life,
 In Your light we see light.
