[C]
 He that is in us is greater than he
 That is in the world.
 He that is in us is greater than he
 That is in the world.
[V1]
 Therefore I will sing and I will rejoice
 For His Spirit lives in me.
 Christ the Living One has overcome
 And we share in His victory.
[V2]
 All the powers of death and hell and sin
 Lie crushed beneath His feet;
 Jesus owns the Name above all names,
 Crowned with honour and majesty.
