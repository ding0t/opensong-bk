[C]
 Here I am, wholly available;
 As for me, I will serve the Lord.
 Here I am, wholly available;
 As for me, I will serve the Lord.
[V1]
 The fields are white unto harvest,
 But O, the labourers are so few;
 So Lord, I give myself to help the reaping,
 To gather precious souls unto You.
[V2]
 The time is right in the nation
 For works of power and authority;
 God's looking for a people who are willing
 To be counted in His glorious victory.
[V3]
 As salt are we ready to savour?
 In darkness are we ready to be light?
 God's seeking out a very special people
 To manifest His truth and His might.
