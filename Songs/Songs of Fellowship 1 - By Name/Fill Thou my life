[V1]
 Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,
 In every part with praise,
 That my whole being may proclaim
 Thy being and Thy ways.
[V2]
 Not for the lip of praise alone,
 Nor e'en the praising heart
 I ask, but for a life made up
 Of praise in every part:
[V3]
 Praise in the common things of life,
 Its goings out and in;
 Praise in each duty and each deed,
 However small and mean.
[V4]
 Fill every part of me with praise;
 Let all my being speak
 Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
 Poor though I be and weak.
[V5]
 So shall Thou, gracious Lord, from me
 Receive the glory due;
 And so shall I begin on earth
 The song forever new.
[V6]
 So shall no part of day or night
 From sacredness be free;
 But all my life, in every step,
 Be fellowship with Thee.
