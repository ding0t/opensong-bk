[V1]
 The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
 The darkness falls at Thy behest;
 To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
 Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.
[V2]
 We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping,
 While earth rolls onward into light,
 Through all the world her watch is keeping,
 And rests not now by day or night.
[V3]
 As o'er each continent and island
 The dawn leads on another day,
 The voice of prayer is never silent,
 Nor dies the strain of praise away.
[V4]
 The sun that bids us rest is waking
 Our brethren 'neath the western sky,
 And hour by hour fresh lips are making
 Thy wondrous doings heard on high.
[V5]
 So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never,
 Like earth's proud empires, pass away;
 Thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
 Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
