[V1]
 For this purpose Christ was revealed,
 To destroy all the works
 Of the Evil One.
 Christ in us has overcome,
 So with gladness we sing
 And welcome His kingdom in.
[C]  
 (Men) Over sin He has conquered,
 (Women) Hallelujah, He has conquered.
 (Men) Over death victorious,
 (Women) Hallelujah, victorious.
 (Men) Over sickness He has triumphed,
 (Women) Hallelujah, He has triumphed.
 (All) Jesus reigns over all!
[V2]
 In the name of Jesus we stand,
 By the power of His blood
 We now claim this ground.
 Satan has no authority here;
 Powers of darkness must flee,
 For Christ has the victory.
