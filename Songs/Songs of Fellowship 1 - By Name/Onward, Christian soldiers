[V1]
 Onward, Christian soldiers,
 Marching as to war,
 With the cross of Jesus 
 Going on before! 
 Christ, the royal Master, 
 Leads against the foe; 
 Forward into battle, 
 See, His banners go!
[C]
 Onward, Christian soldiers, 
 Marching as to war, 
 With the cross of Jesus 
 Going on before.
[V2]
 At the name of Jesus 
 Satan's host doth flee; 
 On then, Christian soldiers, 
 On to victory! 
 Hell's foundations quiver 
 At the shout of praise; 
 Brothers, lift your voices; 
 Loud your anthems raise:
[V3]
 Like a mighty army 
 Moves the church of God: 
 Brothers we are treading 
 Where the saints have trod. 
 We are not divided,
 All one body we, 
 One in hope and doctrine, 
 One in charity.
[V4]
 Crowns and thrones may perish, 
 Kingdoms rise and wane, 
 But the church of Jesus 
 Constant will remain; 
 Gates of hell can never 
 'Gainst that church prevail; 
 We have Christ's own promise, 
 And that cannot fail:
[V5]
 Onward, then, ye people! 
 Join our happy throng; 
 Blend with ours your voices 
 In the triumph-song: 
 Glory, laud, and honour 
 Unto Christ the King! 
 This through countless ages 
 Men and angels sing:
