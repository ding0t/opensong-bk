[V1]
 All people that on earth do dwell,
 Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
 Him serve with mirth, His praise forthtell,
 Come ye before Him and rejoice.
[V2]
 Know that the Lord is God indeed,
 Without our aid He did us make:
 We are His flock, He doth us feed,
 And for His sheep He doth us take.
[V3]
 O enter then His gates with praise,
 Approach with joy His courts unto:
 Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
 For it is seemly so to do.
[V4]
 For why, the Lord our God is good;
 His mercy is forever sure;
 His truth at all times firmly stood,
 And shall from age to age endure.
[V5]
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
 Praise Him all creatures here below,
 Praise Him above, ye heavenly hosts;
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
