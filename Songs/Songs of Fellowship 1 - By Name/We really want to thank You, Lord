[C]
 We really want to thank You, Lord,
 We really want to bless Your name,
 Hallelujah! Jesus is our King!
 We really want to thank You, Lord,
 We really want to bless Your name,
 Hallelujah! Jesus is our King!
[V1]
 We thank You, Lord, for Your gift to us,
 Your life so rich beyond compare,
 The gift of Your body here on earth
 Of which we sing and share.
[V2]
 We thank You, Lord, for our life together,
 To live and move in the love of Christ,
 Tenderness which sets us free
 To serve You with our lives.
