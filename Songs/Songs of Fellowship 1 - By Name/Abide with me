[V1]
 Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;
 The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide;
 When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
 Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
[V2]
 Swift to its close, ebbs out life's little day;
 Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
 Change and decay in all around I see;
 O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
[V3]
 I need Thy presence every passing hour;
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
 Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
 Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.
[V4]
 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
 Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
 Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory? 
 I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
[V5]
 Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes;
 Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies,
 Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
 In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
