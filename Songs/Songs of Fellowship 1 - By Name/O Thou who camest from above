[V1]
 O Thou who camest from above 
 The pure celestial fire to impart, 
 Kindle a flame of sacred love 
 On the mean altar of my heart.
[V2]
 There let it for Thy glory burn 
 With inextinguishable blaze, 
 And trembling to its source return, 
 In humble prayer and fervent praise.
[V3]
 Jesus, confirm my heart's desire 
 To work, and speak, and think for Thee; 
 Still let me guard the holy fire, 
 And still stir up Thy gift in me.
[V4]
 Ready for all Thy perfect will, 
 My acts of faith and love repeat, 
 Till death Thy endless mercies seal, 
 And make the sacrifice complete.
