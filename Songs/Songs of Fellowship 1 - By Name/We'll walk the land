  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We'll walk the land
 With hearts on fire,
 And every step
 Will be a prayer.
 Hope is rising,
 New day dawning,
 Sound of singing
 Fills the air.
[V2]
 Two thousand years,
 And still the flame
 Is burning bright
 Across the land.
 Hearts are waiting,
 Longing, aching,
 For awakening
 Once again.
[C]
 Let the flame burn brighter
 In the heart of the darkness,
 Turning night to glorious day.
 Let the song grow louder
 As our love grows stronger,
 Let it shine, let it shine.
[V3]
 We'll walk for truth,
 Speak out for love;
 In Jesus' name
 We shall be strong,
 To lift the fallen,
 To save the children,
 To fill the nation
 With Your song.
