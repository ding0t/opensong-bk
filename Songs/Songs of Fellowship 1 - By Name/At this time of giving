[V1]
 At this time of giving,
 Gladly now we bring
 Gifts of goodness and mercy
 From a heavenly King.
[V2]
 Earth could not contain the treasures
 Heaven holds for you,
 Perfect joy and lasting pleasures,
 Love so strong and true.
[V3]
 May His tender love surround you
 At this Christmastime;
 May you see His smiling face
 That in the darkness shines.
[V4]
 But the many gifts He gives
 Are all poured out from one;
 Come receive the greatest gift,
 The gift of God's own Son.
[V5]
 Lai, lai, lai ... (etc.)
