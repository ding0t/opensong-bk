[C]
 El-Shaddai, El-Shaddai,
 El-Elyon na Adonai,
 Age to age You're still the same
 By the power of the Name.
 El-Shaddai, El-Shaddai,
 Erkamka na Adonai,
 We will praise and lift You high.
 El-Shaddai.
[V1]
 Through Your love and through the ram
 You saved the son of Abraham;
 Through the power of Your hand,
 Turned the sea into dry land.
 To the outcast on her knees
 You were the God who really sees,
 And by Your might You set Your children free.
[V2]
 Through the years You made it clear
 That the time of Christ was near,
 Though the people couldn't see
 What Messiah ought to be.
 Though Your word contained the plan,
 They just could not understand
 Your most awesome work was done
 Through the frailty of Your Son.
