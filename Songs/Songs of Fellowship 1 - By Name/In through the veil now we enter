  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In through the veil now we enter,
 Boldly approaching Your throne,
 Bearing a sacrifice of fragrance sweet;
 The fruit of some seeds You have sown.
[V2]
 From our lips we offer these praises,
 May You be blessed as we sing.
 Lord, we adore You, like incense before You
 Our worship ascends to the King.
[V3]
 Welling up within our hearts
 Is a song of praise to You,
 We lift up our hands with our voice.
 Blessings and honour,
 Glory and power be unto You,
 Let us rejoice, rejoice.
 Blessings and honour,
 Glory and power be unto You,
 Let us rejoice.
