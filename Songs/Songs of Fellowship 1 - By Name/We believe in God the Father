[V1]
 We believe in God the Father,
 Maker of the universe,
 And in Christ His Son our Saviour,
 Come to us by virgin birth.
 We believe He died to save us,
 Bore our sins, was crucified.
 Then from death He rose victorious,
 Ascended to the Father's side.
[C1]
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all.
 Name above all names,
 Name above all names.
[V2]
 We believe He sends His Spirit,
 On His church with gifts of power.
 God His word of truth affirming,
 Sends us to the nations now.
 He will come again in glory,
 Judge the living and the dead.
 Every knee shall bow before Him,
 Then must every tongue confess. 
[C2]
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all,
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all.
 Name above all names,
 Name above all names.
 Name above all names.
