[V1]
 Jesus, stand among us
 At the meeting of our lives;
 Be our sweet agreement
 At the meeting of our eyes.
 O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
[V2]
 So to You we're gathering
 Out of each and every land;
 Christ the love between us
 At the joining of our hands.
 O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
[V3]
 Jesus, stand among us
 At the breaking of the bread;
 Join us as one body
 As we worship You, our Head.
 O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
