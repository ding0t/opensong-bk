  <lyrics>
[V1]
 May we be a shining light to the nations,
 A shining light to the peoples of the earth;
 Till the whole world sees the glory of Your name,
 May Your pure light shine through us.
[V2]
 May we bring a word of hope to thenations,
 A word of life to the peoples of the earth;
 Till the whole world knows there's salvation through Your name,
 May Your mercy flow through us.
[V3]
 May we be a healing balm to the nations,
 A healing balm to the peoples of the earth;
 Till the whole world knows the power of Your name,
 May Your healing flow through us.
[V4]
 May we sing a song of joy to the nations,
 A song of praise to the peoples of the earth;
 Till the whole world rings with the praises of Your name,
 May Your song be sung through us.
[V5]
 May Your kingdom come to the nations,
 Your will be done in the peoples of the earth;
 Till the whole world knows that Jesus Christ is Lord,
 May Your kingdom come in us,
 May Your kingdom come in us,
 May Your kingdom come on earth.
