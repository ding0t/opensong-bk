[V1]
 Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens
 And the earth by Thy great power.
 Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens
 And the earth by Thine outstretched arm.
[C]
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee,
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
 O great and mighty God,
 Great in counsel and mighty in deed,
 Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing,
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
