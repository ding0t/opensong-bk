[V1]
 One shall tell another, 
 And he shall tell his friend, 
 Husbands, wives and children 
 Shall come following on. 
 From house to house in families 
 Shall more be gathered in, 
 And lights will shine in every street, 
 So warm and welcoming.
[C]
 Come on in and taste the new wine, 
 The wine of the kingdom, 
 The wine of the kingdom of God. 
 Here is healing and forgiveness, 
 The wine of the kingdom, 
 The wine of the kingdom of God.
[V2]
 Compassion of the Father 
 Is ready now to flow, 
 Through acts of love and mercy 
 We must let it show. 
 He turns now from His anger 
 To show a smiling face,
 And longs that men should stand beneath 
 The fountain of His grace.
[V3]
 He longs to do much more than 
 Our faith has yet allowed, 
 To thrill us and surprise us 
 With His sovereign power. 
 Where darkness has been darkest 
 The brightest light will shine, 
 His invitation comes to us, 
 It's yours and it is mine.
