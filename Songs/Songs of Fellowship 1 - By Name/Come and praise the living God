  <lyrics>
[C]
 Come and praise the living God,
 Come and worship, come and worship.
 He has made you priest and king,
 Come and worship the living God.
[V1]
 We come not to a mountain of fire and smoke,
 Not to gloom and darkness or trumpet sound;
 We come to the new Jerusalem,
 The holy city of God.
[V2]
 By His voice He shakes the earth,
 His judgements known throughout theworld.
 But we have a city that forever stands,
 The holy city of God.
