[V1]
 Cause me to come to thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to come to Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to come to Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to come,
 Cause me to drink,
 Cause me to live.
[V2]
 Cause me to drink from Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to drink from Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to drink from Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to come,
 Cause me to drink,
 Cause me to live.
[V3]
 Cause me to live by Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to live by Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to live by Thy river, O Lord,
 Cause me to come,
 Cause me to drink,
 Cause me to live.
