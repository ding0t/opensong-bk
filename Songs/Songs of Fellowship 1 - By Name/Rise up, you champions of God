  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Rise up, you champions of God, 
 Rise up, you royal nation; 
 Rise up, and bear His light abroad, 
 We'll reach this generation. 
 We've got our marching orders, 
 We've got our marching orders; 
 Now is the time to carry them forth.
[C]
 Go forth! Jesus loves them. 
 Go forth! Take the gospel. 
 Go forth! The time is now. 
 The harvest is ripening:
 Go forth!
[V2]
 Feel now the burden of the Lord, 
 Feel how He longs to save them; 
 Feel now for those who never heard 
 About the Son He gave them. 
 We've got our marching orders, 
 We've got our marching orders; 
 Now is the time to carry them forth.
