[V1]
 Jesus, the very thought of Thee
 With sweetness fills the breast;
 But sweeter far Thy face to see,
 And in Thy presence rest.
[V2]
 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
 Nor can the memory find
 A sweeter sound than Thy blessed name,
 O Saviour of mankind!
[V3]
 O hope of every contrite heart,
 O joy of all the meek,
 To those who fall how kind Thou art,
 How good to those who seek!
[V4]
 But what to those who find? Ah, this
 Nor tongue nor pen can show:
 The love of Jesus, what it is
 None but His loved ones know.
[V5]
 Jesus, Thy mercies are untold
 Through each returning day;
 Thy love exceeds a thousandfold
 Whatever we can say.
[V6]
 Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
 As Thou our prize wilt be;
 Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
 And through eternity.
