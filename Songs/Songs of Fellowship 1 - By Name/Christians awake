[V1]
 Christians awake! Salute the happy morn,
 Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;
 Rise to adore the mystery of love
 Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
 ||With them the joyful tidings first begun
 Of God Incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
[V2]
 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
 Who heard the angelic herald's voice 'Behold,
 I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
 To you and all the nations upon earth:
 ||This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
 This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.'
[V3]
 He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
 In hymns of joy unknown before conspire;
 High praise of God's redeeming love they sang,
 And heaven's whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
 ||God's highest glory was their anthem still,
 'On earth be peace, and unto men goodwill.'
[V4]
 O may we keep and ponder in our mind
 God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
 Trace we the Babe who hath retrieved our loss,
 From His poor manger to His bitter cross;
 ||Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
 Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
[V5]
 Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
 To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphant song:
 He that was born upon this joyful day
 Around us all His glory shall display;
 ||Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
 Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.
