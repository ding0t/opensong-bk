[C]
 Sing unto the Lord a new song, 
 Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
 Sing to the Lord, bless His name, 
 He is greatly to be praised, 
 Sing unto the Lord a new song.
[V1]
 Tell among the nations the Lord reigns, 
 The world shall never be moved.
 Let the heavens be glad 
 And the earth rejoice, 
 Sing unto the Lord a new song.
[V2]
 Then shall all the trees sing for joy 
 Before the Lord, for He comes.
 He will judge the world 
 With His righteousness, 
 Sing unto the Lord a new song.
