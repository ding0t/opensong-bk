[V1]
 All over the world the Spirit is moving,
 All over the world as the prophet said it would be;
 All over the world there's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
[V2]
 All over His church God's Spirit is moving,
 All over His church as the prophet said it would be;
 All over His church there's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
[V3]
 Right here in this place the Spirit is moving,
 Right here in this place as the prophet said it would be;
 Right here in this place there's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
