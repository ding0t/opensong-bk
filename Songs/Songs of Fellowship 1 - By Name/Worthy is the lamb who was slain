  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Worthy is the lamb who was slain. 
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, 
 Who was slain. 
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, 
 Who was slain.
[C1]
 To receive power and wealth, 
 To receive wisdom and strength. 
 To receive honour and glory. 
 To receive glory and praise.
[V2]
 Now to Him who sits on the throne 
 And to the Lamb who was slain, 
 Now be praise and honour and glory, 
 And power forever,
 And power forever.
[C2]
 Worthy of power and wealth, 
 Worthy of wisdom and strength. 
 Worthy of honour and glory, 
 Worthy of glory and praise.
[C3]
 Unto the Lamb be power and wealth, 
 Unto the Lamb be wisdom and strength. 
 Unto the Lamb be honour and glory, 
 Unto the Lamb be glory and praise.
