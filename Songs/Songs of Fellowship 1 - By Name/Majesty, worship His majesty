  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Majesty, worship His majesty,
 Unto Jesus be glory, honour and praise.
 Majesty, kingdom authority,
 Flow from His throne unto His own,
 His anthem raise.
[V2]
 So exalt, lift up on high the name of Jesus,
 Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus the King.
 Majesty, worship His majesty,
 Jesus who died, now glorified,
 King of all kings.
