[V1]
 O Lord, have mercy on me, and heal me; 
 O Lord, have mercy on me, and free me. 
 Place my feet upon a rock, 
 Put a new song in my heart, in my heart;
 O Lord, have mercy on me.
[V2]
 O Lord, may Your love and Your grace protect me;
 O Lord, may Your ways and Your truth direct me.
 Place my feet upon a rock,
 Put a new song in my heart, in my heart;
 O Lord, have mercy on me.
