[C]
 Jesus, how lovely You are,
 You are so gentle, so pure and kind.
 You shine as the morning star,
 Jesus, how lovely You are.
[V1]
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus is my Lord and King;
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus is my everything.
[V2]
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus died and rose again;
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus forgave all my sin.
[V3]
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus is meek and lowly;
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus is pure and holy.
[V4]
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus is the Bridegroom;
 Hallelujah, 
Jesus will take His Bride soon.
