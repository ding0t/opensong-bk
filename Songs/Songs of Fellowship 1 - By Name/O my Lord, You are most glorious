[V1]
 O my Lord, You are most glorious, 
 King of kings and Prince of Peace. 
 By Your word this world was created; 
 By Your love I have been set free. 
 ||And I lift my hands in worship up to Your throne,
 I will declare how much You mean to me. 
 You are my Lord, it's You I worship; 
 Son of God, You reign in majesty.
