[V1]
 Who is He in yonder stall, 
 At whose feet the shepherds fall?
[C]
 'Tis the Lord! 
 O wondrous story! 
 'Tis the Lord, the King of glory! 
 At His feet we humbly fall. 
 Crown Him! Crown Him, Lord of all!
[V2]
 Who is He to whom they bring 
 All the sick and sorrowing?
[V3]
 Who is He that stands and weeps 
 At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?
[V4]
 Who is He on yonder tree 
 Dies in pain and agony?
[V5]
 Who is He who from the grave 
 Comes to rescue, help, and save?
[V6]
 Who is He who from His throne 
 Sends the Spirit to His own?
[V7]
 Who is He who comes again, 
 Judge of angels and of men?
