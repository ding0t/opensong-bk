[V1]
 Praise, my soul, the king of heaven; 
 To His feet thy tribute bring. 
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, 
 Who like thee His praise should sing? 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise the everlasting King!
[V2]
 Praise Him for His grace and favour 
 To our fathers in distress; 
 Praise Him, still the same forever, 
 Slow to chide, and swift to bless. 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Glorious in His faithfulness.
[V3]
 Father-like, He tends and spares us; 
 Well our feeble frame He knows; 
 In His hands He gently bears us, 
 Rescues us from all our foes. 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Widely as His mercy flows.
[V4]
 Angels in the height, adore Him; 
 Ye behold Him face to face; 
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him, 
 Dwellers all in time and space. 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise Him! Praise Him! 
 Praise with us the God of grace!
