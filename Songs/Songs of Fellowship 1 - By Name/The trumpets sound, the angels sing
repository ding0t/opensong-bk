[V1]
 The trumpets sound, the angels sing,
 The feast is ready to begin;
 The gates of heaven are open wide,
 And Jesus welcomes you inside.
[V2]
 Tables are laden with good things,
 O taste the peace and joy He brings;
 He'll fill you up with love divine,
 He'll turn your water into wine.
[C]
 Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight.
 Come and revel in heaven's love and light;
 Take your place at the table of the King.
 The feast is ready to begin.
 The feast is ready to begin.
[V3]
 The hungry heart He satisfies,
 Offers the poor His paradise;
 Now hear all heaven and earth applaud
 The amazing goodness of the Lord.
[B]
 Ldr: Jesus, (All echo each line)
 We thank You
 For Your love,
 For Your joy.
 Jesus,
 We thank You
 For the good things
 You give to us.
