  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In thy presence there's fulness of joy,
 Fulness of joy, fulness of joy.
 At Thy right hand are pleasures forever,
 Pleasures forever more.
[V2]
 I keep the Lord before me,
 I shall not be moved.
 My heart is glad and my soul rejoices;
 I shall dwell in safety.
[V3]
 And in Thy presence there's fulness of joy,
 Fulness of joy, fulness of joy.
 At Thy right hand are pleasures forever,
 Pleasures forever more.
