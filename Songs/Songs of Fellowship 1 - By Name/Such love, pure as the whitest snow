  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Such love, pure as the whitest snow; 
 Such love, weeps for the shame I know; 
 Such love, paying the debt I owe; 
 O Jesus, such love.
[V2]
 Such love, stilling my restlessness; 
 Such love, filling my emptiness; 
 Such love, showing me holiness; 
 O Jesus, such love.
[V3]
 Such love, springs from eternity; 
 Such love, streaming through history; 
 Such love, fountain of life to me; 
 O Jesus, such love.
