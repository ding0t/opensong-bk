[V1]
 Son of God, this is our praise song. 
 Jesus, my Lord, I sing to You. 
 Come now, Spirit of God, 
 Breathe life into these words of love; 
 Angels join from above 
 As we sing our praise song.
[C1]
 We praise You, we praise You, 
 We praise You, we worship You. 
 We praise You, we worship You.
[V2]
 Son of God, this is our love song. 
 Jesus, my Lord, I sing to You. 
 Come now, Spirit of God, 
 Breathe life into these words of love; 
 Angels join from above 
 As we sing our love song.
[C2]
 We love You, we love You,
 We love You, we worship You.
 We love You, we worship You.
