  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I just want to praise You,
 Lift my hands and say: 'I love You.'
 You are everything to me,
 And I exalt Your holy name on high.
[V2]
 I just want to praise You,
 Lift my hands and say: 'I love You.'
 You are everything to me,
 And I exalt Your holy name,
 I exalt Your holy name,
 I exalt Your holy name on high.
