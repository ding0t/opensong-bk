[V1]
 Let us break bread together, we are one.
 Let us break bread together, we are one.
 We are one as we stand
 With our face to the risen Son.
 O Lord, have mercy on us.
[V2]
 Let us drink wine together, we are one,
 Let us drink wine together, we are one.
 We are one as we stand
 With our face to the risen Son.
 O Lord, have mercy on us.
[V3]
 Let us praise God together, we are one,
 Let us praise God together, we are one.
 We are one as we stand
 With our face to the risen Son.
 O Lord, have mercy on us.
