  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, You are calling the people of Your kingdom
 To battle in Your name against the enemy;
 To stand before You, a people who will serve You,
 Till Your kingdom is released throughout the earth.
[C]
 Let Your kingdom come,
 Let Your will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven.
 Let Your kingdom come,
 Let Your will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven.
[V2]
 At the name of Jesus every knee must bow;
 The darkness of this age must flee away.
 Release Your power to flow throughout the land;
 Let Your glory be revealed as we praise.
