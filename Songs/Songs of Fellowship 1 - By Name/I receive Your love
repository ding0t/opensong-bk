[V1]
 I receive Your love,
 I receive Your love,
 In my heart I receive Your love, O Lord.
 I receive Your love
 By Your Spirit within me,
 I receive, I receive Your love.
[V2]
 I confess Your love,
 I confess Your love,
 From my heart I confess Your love, O Lord.
 I confess Your love
 By Your Spirit within me,
 I confess, I confess Your love.
