[V1]
 It is good for me to draw near unto God;
 Lord, I put my trust in Thee,
 That I may declare all Thy works, O my God,
 Lord, I put my trust in Thee.
[V2]
 My flesh and my heart they fail me,
 But God is the strength of my life;
 You are my portion both now and ever more,
 There is none that I desire but Thee.
