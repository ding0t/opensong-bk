  <lyrics>
[C]
 Fear not, for I am with you,
 Fear not, for I am with you,
 Fear not, for I am with you,
 Says the Lord.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 I have redeemed you,
 I've called you by name;
 Child, you are Mine.
 When you walk through the waters,
 I will be there,
 And through the flame.
 You'll not be drowned,
 You'll not be burned,
 For I am with you.
