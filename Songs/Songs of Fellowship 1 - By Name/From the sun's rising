  <lyrics>
[V1]
 From the sun's rising
 Unto the sun's setting,
 Jesus our Lord
 Shall be great in the earth;
 And all earth's kingdoms
 Shall be His dominion,
 All of creation
 Shall sing of His worth.
[C]
 Let every heart, every voice,
 Every tongue join with spirits ablaze;
 One in His love, we will circle the world
 With the song of His praise.
 O, let all His people rejoice,
 And let all the earth hear His voice!
[V2]
 To every tongue, tribe
 And nation He sends us,
 To make disciples,
 To teach and baptise.
 For all authority
 To Him is given;
 Now as His witnesses
 We shall arise.
[V3]
 Come let us join with
 The church from all nations,
 Cross every border,
 Throw wide every door;
 Workers with Him
 As He gathers His harvest,
 Till earth's far corners
 Our Saviour adore.
