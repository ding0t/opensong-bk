[V1]
 My God, how wonderful Thou art,
 Thy majesty how bright!
 How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,
 In depths of burning light!
[V2]
 How dread are Thine eternal years,
 O everlasting Lord,
 By prostrate spirits day and night
 Incessantly adored!
[V3]
 How wonderful, how beautiful
 The sight of Thee must be,
 Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
 And awesome purity!
[V4]
 O how I fear Thee, living God,
 With deepest, tenderest fears,
 And worship Thee with trembling hope
 And penitential tears!
[V5]
 Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord,
 Almighty as Thou art,
 For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
 The love of my poor heart.
[V6]
 No earthly father loves like Thee;
 No mother e'er so mild
 Bears and forbears as Thou hast done
 With me, Thy sinful child.
[V7]
 Father of Jesus, love's reward,
 What rapture will it be
 Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
 And gaze, and gaze on Thee.
