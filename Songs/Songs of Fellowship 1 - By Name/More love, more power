[V1]
 More love (more love),
 More power (more power),
 More of You in my life.
 More love (more love),
 More power (more power),
 More of You in my life.
[V2]
 And I will worship You with all of my heart,
 And I will worship You with all of my mind,
 And I will worship You with all of my strength,
 For You are my Lord.
[V3]
 And I will seek Your face with all of my heart,
 And I will seek Your face with all of my mind,
 And I will seek Your face with all of my strength,
 For You are my Lord,
 You are my Lord.
