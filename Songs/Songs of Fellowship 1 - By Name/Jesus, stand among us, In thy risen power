  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Jesus, stand among us,
 In thy risen power,
 Let this time of worship
 Be a hallowed hour.
[V2]
 Breathe Thy Holy Spirit
 Into every heart,
 Bid the fears and sorrows
 From each soul depart.
 Thus with quickened footsteps
 We'll pursue our way,
 Watching for the dawning
 Of eternal day. 
  </lyrics></song>
