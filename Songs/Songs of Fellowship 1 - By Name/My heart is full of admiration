  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My heart is full of admiration
 For You, my Lord, my God and King.
 Your excellence my inspiration,
 Your words of grace have made my spirit sing.
[C]
 All the glory, honour and power
 Belong to You, belong to You. 
 Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One,
 I worship You, I worship You.
[V2]
 You love what's right and hate what's evil,
 Therefore Your God sets You on high, 
 And on Your head pours oil of gladness,
 While fragrance fills Your royal palaces.
[V3]
 Your throne, O God, will last forever,
 Justice will be Your royal decree. 
 In majesty, ride out victorious, 
 For righteousness, truth and humility.
