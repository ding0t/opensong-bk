[V1]
 See, amid the winter's snow, 
 Born for us on earth below, 
 See, the Lamb of God appears, 
 Promised from eternal years.
[C]
 Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! 
 Hail, redemption's happy dawn! 
 Sing through all Jerusalem:
 Christ is born in Bethlehem!
[V2]
 Lo, within a manger lies
 He who built the starry skies,
 He who throned in height sublime
 Sits amid the cherubim.
[V3]
 Say, ye holy shepherds, say, 
 What your joyful news today; 
 Wherefore have ye left your sheep 
 On the lonely mountain steep?
[V4]
 'As we watched at dead of night, 
 Lo, we saw a wondrous light: 
 Angels singing, "Peace on earth" 
 Told us of the Saviour's birth.'
[V5]
 Sacred Infant, all divine, 
 What a tender love was Thine, 
 Thus to come from highest bliss 
 Down to such a world as this!
[V6]
 Teach, O teach us, holy Child, 
 By Thy face so meek and mild, 
 Teach us to resemble Thee 
 In Thy sweet humility.
