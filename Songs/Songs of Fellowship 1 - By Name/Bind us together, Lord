[C]
 Bind us together, Lord,
 Bind us together
 With cords that cannot be broken.
 Bind us together, Lord,
 Bind us together,
 Bind us together with love.
[V1]
 There is only one God,
 There is only one King;
 There is only one Body,
 That is why we sing:
[V2]
 Made for the glory of God,
 Purchased by His precious Son;
 Born with the right to be clean,
 For Jesus the victory has won.
[V3]
 You are the family of God,
 You are the promise divine;
 You are God's chosen desire,
 You are the glorious new wine.
