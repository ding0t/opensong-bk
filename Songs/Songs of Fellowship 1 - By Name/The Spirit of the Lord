  <lyrics>
[V1]
 The Spirit of the Lord,
 The sovereign Lord, is on me,
 Because He has anointed me
 To preach good news to the poor:
[C]
 Proclaiming Jesus, only Jesus -
 It is Jesus, Saviour, healer and baptiser,
 And the mighty King,
 The victor and deliverer -
 He is Lord, He is Lord, He is Lord!
[V2]
 And He has called on me
 To bind up all the broken hearts,
 To minister release
 To every captivated soul:
[V3]
 Let| righteousness arise
 And blossom as a garden;
 Let praise begin to spring
 In every tongue and nation:
