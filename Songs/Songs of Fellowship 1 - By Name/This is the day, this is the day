[V1]
 This is the day, this is the day
 That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made;
 We shall rejoice, we shall rejoice
 And be glad in it, and be glad in it.
[V2]
 This is the day that the Lord has made,
 We shall rejoice and be glad in it;
 This is the day, this is the day
 That the Lord has made.
