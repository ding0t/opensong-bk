[V1]
 There is a name I love to hear,
 I love to speak its worth;
 It sounds like music in my ear,
 The sweetest name on earth.
[C]
 O, how I love the Saviour's name,
 O, how I love the Saviour's name,
 O, how I love the Saviour's name,
 The sweetest name on earth.
[V2]
 It tells me of a Saviour's love,
 Who died to set me free;
 It tells me of His precious blood,
 The sinner's perfect plea.
[V3]
 It tells of One whose loving heart
 Can feel my deepest woe;
 Who in my sorrow bears a part
 That none can bear below.
[V4]
 It bids my trembling heart rejoice,
 It dries each rising tear;
 It tells me in a still, small voice
 To trust and never fear.
[V5]
 Jesus, the name I love so well,
 The name I love to hear!
 No saint on earth its worth can tell,
 No heart conceive how dear!
