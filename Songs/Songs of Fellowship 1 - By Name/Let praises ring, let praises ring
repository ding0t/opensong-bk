  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Let praises ring, let praises ring,
 Lift voices up to love Him,
 Lift hearts and hands to touch Him,
 O let praises ring.
 ||And fill the skies with anthems high
 That tell His excellencies,
 As priests and kings who rule with Him
 Through all eternity;
 Let praises ring, let praises ring
 To our glorious King.
[V2]
 Let praises ring, let praises ring,
 Bow down in adoration,
 Cry out His exaltation,
 O let praises ring.
 ||And lift the Name above all names
 Till every nation knows
 The love of God has come to men,
 His mercies overflow.
