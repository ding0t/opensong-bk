[V1]
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we need,
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we need,
 So help us, Lord, to worship You,
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we need.
[V2]
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we love,
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we love,
 So help us, Lord, to worship You, 
 It's the presence of Your Spirit, Lord, we love.
[V3]
 For the moving of Your Spirit, Lord, we pray,
 For the moving of Your Spirit, Lord, we pray,
 So help us, Lord, to worship You, 
 For the moving of Your Spirit, Lord, we pray.
