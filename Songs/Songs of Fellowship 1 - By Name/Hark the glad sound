[V1]
 Hark the glad sound! The Saviour comes,
 The Saviour promised long;
 Let every heart prepare a throne,
 And every voice a song.
[V2]
 He comes the prisoners to release,
 In Satan's bondage held;
 The gates of brass before Him burst,
 The iron fetters yield.
[V3]
 He comes the broken heart to bind,
 The bleeding soul to cure,
 And with the treasures of His grace
 To enrich the humble poor.
[V4]
 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
 Thy welcome shall proclaim;
 And heaven's eternal arches ring
 With Thy beloved name.
