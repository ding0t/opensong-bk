  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are beautiful beyond description, 
 Too marvellous for words, 
 Too wonderful for comprehension,
 Like nothing ever seen or heard. 
 ||Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom? 
 Who can fathom the depth of Your love? 
 You are beautiful beyond description, 
 Majesty, enthroned above.
[C]
 And I stand, I stand in awe of You. 
 I stand, I stand in awe of You. 
 Holy God, to whom all praise is due, 
 I stand in awe of You.
