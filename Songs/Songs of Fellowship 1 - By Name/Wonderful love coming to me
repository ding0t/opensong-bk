  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Wonderful love coming to me, 
 Wonderful grace, freedom and mercy; 
 Bought with a price, death on a cross, 
 Wonderful love, Jesus, You've given to me.
[V2]
 You are Christ, Son of God, 
 Suffering Lamb, pouring out Your life; 
 You've conquered death, 
 And You're reigning supreme in my life.
