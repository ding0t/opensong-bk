[V1]
 Father in heaven,
 Our voices we raise;
 Receive our devotion,
 Receive now our praise,
 As we sing of the glory
 Of all that You've done,
 The greatest love story
 That's ever been sung.
[C]
 And we will crown You Lord of all,
 Yes, we will crown You Lord of all,
 For You have won the victory,
 Yes, we will crown You Lord of all.
[V2]
 Father in heaven,
 Our lives are Your own;
 We've been caught by a vision
 Of Jesus alone,
 Who came as a servant
 To free us from sin.
 Father in heaven,
 Our worship we bring:
[V3]
 We will sing 'Hallelujah,'
 We will sing to the King,
 To our Mighty Deliverer
 Our hallelujahs will ring.
 Yes, our praise is resounding
 To the Lamb on the throne;
 He alone is exalted
 Through the love He has shown.
