[V1]
 Great is the Lord and mighty in power,
 His understanding has no limit;
 The Lord delights in those who fear Him,
 Who put their hope in His unfailing love.
[V2]
 He strengthens the bars of your gates,
 He grants you peace in your borders,
 He reveals His word to His people;
 He has done this for no other nation.
[V3]
 Great is the Lord and mighty in power,
 His understanding has no limit;
 Extol the Lord, O Jerusalem,
 Praise your God, O people of Zion.
