  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Let us praise His name with dancing
 And with the tambourine.
 Let us praise His name with dancing,
 Make a joyful noise and sing.
[C]
 Dance, dance, dance before the King.
 Dance, dance, celebrate and sing.
[V2]
 Let us celebrate with dancing;
 The King has set us free.
 Let us celebrate with dancing,
 Rejoice in victory.
