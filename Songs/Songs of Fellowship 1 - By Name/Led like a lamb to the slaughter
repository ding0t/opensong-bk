  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Led like a lamb to the slaughter
 In silence and shame,
 There on Your back You carried a world
 Of violence and pain.
 Bleeding, dying, bleeding, dying.
[C]
 You're alive, You're alive,
 You have risen, Alleluia!
 And the power and the glory is given,
 Alleluia, Jesus, to You.
[V2]
 At break of dawn, poor Mary,
 Still weeping she came,
 When through her grief she heard Yourvoice
 Now speaking her name.
 Mary, Master, Mary, Master!
[V3]
 At the right hand of the Father
 Now seated on high
 You have begun Your eternal reign
 Of justice and joy.
 Glory, glory, glory, glory.
