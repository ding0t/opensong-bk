[V1]
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 Alleluia, alleluia.
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 Alleluia, alleluia.
[V2]
 He's my Saviour, He's my Saviour,
 He's my Saviour, He's my Saviour,
 He's my Saviour, He's my Saviour,
 He's my Saviour, He's my Saviour,
[V3]
 He is worthy, He is worthy,
 He is worthy, He is worthy,
 He is worthy, He is worthy,
 He is worthy, He is worthy,
[V4]
 I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
 I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
 I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
 I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
