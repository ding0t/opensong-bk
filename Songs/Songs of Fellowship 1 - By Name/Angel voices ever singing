[V1]
 Angel voices ever singing
 Round Thy throne of light,
 Angel harps forever ringing,
 Rest not day nor night;
 Thousands only live to bless Thee,
 And confess Thee
 Lord of might.
[V2]
 Thou who art beyond the farthest
 Mortal eye can scan,
 Can it be that Thou regardest
 Songs of sinful man?
 Can we know that Thou art near us
 And wilt hear us?
 Yes, we can.
[V3]
 Yes, we know that Thou rejoicest
 O'er each work of Thine;
 Thou didst ears and hands and voices
 For Thy praise design;
 Craftsman's art and music's measure
 For Thy pleasure
 All combine.
[V4]
 In Thy house, great God, we offer
 Of Thine own to Thee,
 And for Thine acceptance proffer,
 All unworthily,
 Hearts and minds and hands and voices
 In our choicest
 Psalmody.
[V5]
 Honour, glory, might, and merit
 Thine shall ever be,
 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
 Blessed Trinity.
 Of the best that Thou hast given
 Earth and heaven
 Render Thee.
