[V1]
 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
 In a believer's ear;
 It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
 And drives away his fear.
 ||It makes the wounded spirit whole,
 And calms the troubled breast;
 'Tis manna to the hungry soul
 And to the weary, rest,
 And to the weary, rest.
[V2]
 Dear name, the Rock on which I build,
 My shield, and hiding place;
 My never failing treasury, filled
 With boundless stores of grace.
 ||Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
 My Prophet, Priest, and King;
 My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
 Accept the praise I bring,
 Accept the praise I bring.
[V3]
 Weak is the effort of my heart,
 And cold my warmest thought;
 But when I see You as You are,
 I'll praise You as I ought.
 ||I would Your boundless love proclaim
 With every fleeting breath;
 So shall the music of Your name
 Refresh my soul in death,
 Refresh my soul in death.
