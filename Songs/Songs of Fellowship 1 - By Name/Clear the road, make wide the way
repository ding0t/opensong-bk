[V1]
 Clear the road, make wide the way. (echo)
 Welcome now the God who saves.     (echo)
 Fill the streets with shouts of joy. (echo)
 (Cheers, etc.)
[C]
 Prepare the way of the Lord! (echo)
 Prepare the way of the Lord! (echo)
[V2]
 Raise your voice and join the song, (echo)
 God made flesh to us has come. (echo)
 Welcome Him, your banners wave. (echo)
 (Cheers, shouts, wave banners, etc.)
[V3]
 For all sin the price is paid, (echo)
 All our sins on Jesus laid. (echo)
 By His blood we are made clean. (echo)
 (Cheers, shouts of thanksgiving)
[V4]
 At His feet come humbly bow, (echo)
 In your lives enthrone Him now. (echo)
 See, your great Deliverer comes. (echo)
 (Cheers, shouts welcoming Jesus)
