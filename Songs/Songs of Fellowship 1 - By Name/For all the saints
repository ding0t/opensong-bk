[V1]
 For all the saints, who from their labours rest,
 Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
 Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Thou wast their Rock, their fortress, and their might;
 Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
 Thou in the darkness drear their one true light.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V3]
 O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
 Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
 And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold!
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V4]
 O blest communion, fellowship divine!
 We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
 Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V5]
 And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
 Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
 And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V6]
 The golden evening brightens in the west;
 Soon, soon to faithful warriors cometh rest;
 Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V7]
 But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
 The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
 The King of glory passes on His way.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V8]
 From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
 Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
 Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
