  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Bring a psalm to the Lord,
 From the Spirit and from His word.
 Lift your voice and rejoice,
 For our God is a mighty King,
 ||So come and clap your hands,
 Raise a shout, as we stand before the Lord,
 For the Lord is He who has the power to free,
 Who by His mighty arm gives strength and victory.
 ||So as we hail the King
 Then let His praises ring,
 And bring a psalm of joy before the Lord.
