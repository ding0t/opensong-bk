  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We break this bread to share in the body of Christ (Men)
 We break this bread to share in the body of Christ (Women)
[C]
 Though we are many, we are one body,
 Because we all share, we all share in one bread.
   (Repeat)
[V2]
 We drink this cup to share in the body of Christ (Men)
 We drink this cup to share in the body of Christ (Women)
