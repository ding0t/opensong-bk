[V1]
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Sleeps the world; hid from sight, 
 Mary and Joseph in stable bare 
 Watch o'er the Child beloved and fair, 
 Sleeping in heavenly rest, 
 Sleeping in heavenly rest.
[V2]
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Shepherds first saw the light, 
 Heard resounding clear and long, 
 Far and near, the angel-song: 
 'Christ the Redeemer is here, 
 Christ the Redeemer is here.'
[V3]
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Son of God, O how bright 
 Love is smiling from Thy face! 
 Strikes for us now the hour of grace, 
 Saviour, since Thou art born, 
 Saviour, since Thou art born.
