  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Great and marvellous are thy works,
 O Lord God the Almighty.
 Righteous and true are Thy ways,
 O Thou King of the nations.
[V2]
 Who will not fear, O Lord,
 And glorify Thy name?
 For Thou alone art holy,
 And all the nations will come before Thee
 And worship, worship, worship before Thee,
 And worship, worship, worship before Thee.
