[V1]
 The Church's one foundation
 Is Jesus Christ the Lord,
 And on that revelation
 Each one of us is called
 To taste His full salvation,
 To know His life within;
 A pure and holy nation
 To glorify the King.
[C]
 Hallelujah, how great You are,
 Reigning in glory, enthroned in power;
 Bright Morning Star, how great You are;
 Reigning in glory, enthroned in power.
[V2]
 This time of preparation
 Eventually will yield
 The fruit of all His labours;
 His heart will be fulfilled.
 From every tribe and nation
 His people shall be known;
 Drawn to be His kingdom,
 Made out of living stones.
[V3]
 See Him and be radiant,
 Taste the Lord and know
 He wants to take us deeper,
 For what we are we sow;
 With streams of living water
 He longs to overflow,
 That out to all creation
 His glory He will show.
