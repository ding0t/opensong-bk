[V1]
 All heaven waits with bated breath,
 For saints on earth to pray.
 Majestic angels ready stand
 With swords of fiery blade.
 Astounding power awaits a word
 From God's resplendent throne.
 But God awaits our prayer of faith
 That cries 'Your will be done.'
[V2]
 Awake, O church, arise and pray;
 Complaining words discard.
 The Spirit comes to fill your mouth
 With truth, His mighty sword.
 Go place your feet on Satan's ground
 And there proclaim Christ's name,
 In step with heaven's armies march
 To conquer and to reign!
[V3]
 Now in our hearts and on our lips
 The word of faith is near,
 Let heaven's will on earth be done,
 Let heaven flow from here.
 Come blend your prayers with Jesus' own
 Before the Father's throne,
 And as the incense clouds ascend
 God's holy fire rains down.
[V4]
 Soon comes the day when with a shout
 King Jesus shall appear,
 And with Him all the church,
 From every age, shall fill the air.
 The brightness of His coming shall
 Consume the lawless one,
 As with a word the breath of God
 Tears down his rebel throne.
[V5]
 One body here, by heaven inspired,
 We seek prophetic power;
 In Christ agreed, one heart and voice,
 To speak this day, this hour,
 In every place where chaos rules
 And evil forces brood;
 Let Jesus' voice speak like the roar
 Of a great multitude.
