[C]
 Wind, wind, blow on me, 
 Wind, wind, set me free, 
 Wind, wind, my Father sent 
 The blessed Holy Spirit.
[V1]
 Jesus told us all about You, 
 How we could not live without You, 
 With His blood the power bought, 
 To help us live the life He taught.
[V2]
 When we're weary, You console us; 
 When we're lonely You enfold us; 
 When in danger You uphold us, 
 Blessed Holy Spirit.
[V3]
 When unto the church You came 
 It was not in Your own but Jesus' name. 
 Jesus Christ is still the same, 
 He sends the Holy Spirit.
[V4]
 Set us free to love our brothers; 
 Set us free to live for others, 
 That the world the Son might see, 
 And Jesus' name exalted be.
