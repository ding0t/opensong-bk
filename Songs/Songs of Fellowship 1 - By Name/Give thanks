  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Give thanks with a grateful heart.
 Give thanks to the Holy One.
 Give thanks because He's given
 Jesus Christ, His Son.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 And now let the weak say 'I am strong,'
 Let the poor say 'I am rich,'
 Because of what the Lord has done for us.
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 Give thanks with a grateful heart.
 Give thanks to the Holy One.
 Give thanks because He's given
 Jesus Christ, His Son.
 (Repeat)
 Give thanks.
