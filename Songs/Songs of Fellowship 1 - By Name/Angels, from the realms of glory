[V1]
 Angels, from the realms of glory,
 Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
 Ye who sang creation's story,
 Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
[C]
 Come and worship
 Christ, the new-born King.
 Come and worship
 Worship Christ, the new-born King.
[V2]
 Shepherds, in the field abiding,
 Watching o'er your flocks by night,
 God with man is now residing,
 Yonder shines the infant-light:
[V3]
 Sages, leave your contemplations,
 Brighter visions beam afar;
 Seek the great desire of nations,
 Ye have seen His natal star:
[V4]
 Saints, before the altar bending,
 Watching long in hope and fear,
 Suddenly the Lord descending
 In His temple shall appear:
