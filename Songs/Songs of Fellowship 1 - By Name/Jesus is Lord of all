  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Jesus is Lord of all,
 Satan is under His feet,
 Jesus is reigning on high
 And all power is given to Him
 In heaven and earth.
[V2]
 We are joined to Him,
 Satan is under our feet,
 We are seated on high
 And all authority is given
 To us through Him.
[V3]
 One day we'll be like Him,
 Perfect in every way,
 Chosen to be His bride,
 Ruling and reigning with Him
 Forever more.
