  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Sing to the Lord, be joyful in praise, 
 Exalt His magnificent ways. 
 Sing to the Lord again and again, 
 Forever His glory proclaim. 
 ||Let anthems of worship ascend to the King, 
 Giving all honour to Him. 
 Great is His name throughout all the earth, 
 With all of our strength let us sing, 
 Let us sing:
[V2]
 Glory to the Lord! 
 Glory to the Lord! 
 With our voices we shall give 
 Glory to the Lord!
