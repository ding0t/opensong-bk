[V1]
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever,
 I will sing, I will sing.
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever,
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[V2]
 With my mouth will I make known
 Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness.
 With my mouth will I make known
 Thy faithfulness to all generations.
