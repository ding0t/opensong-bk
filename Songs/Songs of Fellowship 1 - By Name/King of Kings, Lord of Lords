[V1]
 King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
 Lion of Judah, Word of God.
 King of kings, Lord of Lords,
 Lion of Judah, Word of God.
[V2]
 And here He comes, the King of glory comes!
 In righteousness He comes to judge the earth.
 And here He comes, the King of glory comes!
 With justice He'll rule the earth.
