[V1]
 I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
 Trusting only Thee!
 Trusting Thee for full salvation,
 Great and free.
[V2]
 I am trusting Thee for pardon,
 At Thy feet I bow;
 For Thy grace and tender mercy,
 Trusting now.
[V3]
 I am trusting Thee for cleansing
 In the crimson flood;
 Trusting Thee to make me holy,
 By Thy blood.
[V4]
 I am trusting Thee for power,
 Thine can never fail;
 Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
 Must prevail.
[V5]
 I am trusting Thee to guide me,
 Thou alone shalt lead;
 Every day and hour supplying
 All my need.
[V6]
 I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
 Never let me fall;
 I am trusting Thee for ever,
 And for all.
