  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Let Me have My way among you,
 Do not strive, 
 do not strive.
 Let Me have My way among you,
 Do not strive, 
 do not strive.
 ||For Mine is the power and the glory
 For ever and ever the same.
 Let Me have My way among you,
 Do not strive, do not strive.
[V2]
 We'll let You have Your way among us,
 We'll not strive, 
 we'll not strive.
 We'll let You have Your way among us,
 We'll not strive, 
 we'll not strive.
 ||For Yours is the power and the glory
 For ever and ever the same.
 We'll let You have Your way among us,
 We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
[V3]
 Let My peace rule within your hearts,
 Do not strive, 
 do not strive.
 Let My peace rule within your hearts,
 Do not strive, 
 do not strive.
 ||For Mine is the power and the glory,
 For ever and ever the same.
 Let My peace rule within your hearts,
 Do not strive, do not strive.
[V4]
 We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
 We'll not strive, 
 we'll not strive.
 We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
 We'll not strive, 
 we'll not strive.
 ||For Yours is the power and the glory,
 For ever and ever the same.
 We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
 We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
