  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O let the son of God enfold You 
 With His Spirit and His love, 
 Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul. 
 O let Him have the things that hold you, 
 And His Spirit like a dove 
 Will descend upon your life and make you whole.
[C]
 Jesus, O Jesus, 
 Come and fill Your lambs. 
 Jesus, O Jesus, 
 Come and fill Your lambs.
[V2]
 O come and sing this song with gladness 
 As your hearts are filled with joy, 
 Lift your hands in sweet surrender to His name.
 O give Him all your tears and sadness, 
 Give Him all your years of pain, 
 And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.
