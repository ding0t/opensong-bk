[V1]
 Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace,
 Over all victorious, in its bright increase:
 Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day;
 Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.
[C]
 Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest;
 Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
[V2]
 Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
 Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
 Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
 Not a blast of hurry touched the Spirit there.
[V3]
 Every joy or trial falleth from above,
 Traced upon our dial by the sun of love.
 We may trust Him fully, all for us to do;
 They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
