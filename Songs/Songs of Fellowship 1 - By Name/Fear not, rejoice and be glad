[C]
 Fear not, rejoice and be glad,
 The Lord hath done a great thing;
 Hath poured out His Spirit on all mankind,
 On those who confess His name.
[V1]
 The fig tree is budding, the vine beareth fruit,
 The wheat fields are golden with grain.
 Thrust in the sickle, the harvest is ripe,
 The Lord has given us rain.
[V2]
 Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
 The mountains will drip with sweet wine.
 My children shall drink of the fountain of life,
 My children will know they are Mine.
[V3]
 My children shall dwell in a Body of love,
 A light to the world they will be.
 Life shall come forth from the Father above,
 My Body will set mankind free.
