[C]
 I want to be a history maker, (echo)
 I want to be a world shaker, (echo)
 To be a pen on history's pages, (echo)
 Faithful to the end of the ages. (echo)
 ||I want to see Your kingdom come,
 I want to see Your will be done
 On the earth.
 I want to see Your kingdom come,
 I want to see Your will be done
 On the earth as it is in heaven.
[V1]
 I believe I was called and chosen (echo)
 Long before the world's creation, (echo)
 Called to be a holy person, (echo)
 Called to bear good fruit for heaven. (echo)
[V2]
 We want to be the generation (echo)
 Taking the news to every nation, (echo)
 Filled with the Spirit without measure, (echo)
 Working for a heavenly treasure. (echo)
