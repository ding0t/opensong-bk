  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Prince of peace You are,
 You're bright and morning star;
 Wondrous royal King,
 You have made my heart to sing.
 ||I worship You in spirit and in truth;
 Lifting my praise, Your name in song Iraise.
 I give to You my life,
 I offer up my sacrifice,
 I pledge my love to You,
 My God and King.
