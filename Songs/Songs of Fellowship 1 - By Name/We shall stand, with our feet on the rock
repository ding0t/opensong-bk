  <lyrics>
[C]
 We shall stand
 With our feet on the Rock.
 Whatever men may say,
 We'll lift Your name up high.
 And we shall walk
 Through the darkest night.
 Setting our faces like flint;
 We'll walk into the light.
[V1]
 Lord, You have chosen me
 For fruitfulness,
 To be transformed into
 Your likeness.
 I'm gonna fight on through
 Till I see You face to face.
[V2]
 Lord, as Your witnesses
 You've appointed us.
 And with Your Holy Spirit
 Anointed us.
 And so I'll fight on through,
 Till I see You face to face.
