[V1]
 Man of sorrows! what a name
 For the Son of God, who came
 Ruined sinners to reclaim!
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V2]
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
 In my place condemned He stood;
 Sealed my pardon with His blood:
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V3]
 Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
 Spotless Lamb of God was He:
 Full atonement - can it be?
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V4]
 Lifted up was He to die,
 'It is finished!' was His cry:
 Now in heaven exalted high:
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V5]
 When He comes, our glorious King,
 All His ransomed home to bring,
 Then anew this song we'll sing:
 'Hallelujah! what a Saviour!'
