[V1]
 A safe stronghold our God is still,
 A trusty shield and weapon;
 He'll help us clear from all the ill
 That hath us now o'ertaken.
 ||The ancient prince of hell
 Hath risen with purpose fell;
 Strong mail of craft and power
 He weareth in this hour;
 On earth is not His fellow.
[V2]
 With force of arms we nothing can,
 Full soon were we down-ridden;
 But for us fights the proper Man,
 Whom God Himself hath bidden.
 ||Ask ye: Who is this same?
 Christ Jesus is His name,
 The Lord Sabaoth's Son;
 He, and no other one,
 Shall conquer in the battle.
[V3]
 And were this world all devils o'er,
 And watching to devour us,
 We lay it not to heart so sore;
 Not they can overpower us.
 ||And let the prince of ill
 Look grim as e'er he will,
 He harms us not a whit;
 For why? his doom is writ;
 A word shall quickly slay him.
[V4]
 God's word, for all their craft and force,
 One moment will not linger,
 But, spite of hell, shall have its course;
 'Tis written by His finger.
 ||And though they take our life,
 Goods, honour, children, wife,
 Yet is their profit small:
 These things shall vanish all;
 The city of God remaineth.
