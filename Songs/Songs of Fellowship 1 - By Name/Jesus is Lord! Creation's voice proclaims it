[V1]
 Jesus is Lord! Creation's voice proclaims it,
 For by His power each tree and flower
 Was planned and made.
 Jesus is Lord! The universe declares it,
 Sun, moon and stars in heaven
 Cry, 'Jesus is Lord!'
[C]
 Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
 Praise Him with hallelujahs
 For Jesus is Lord!
[V2]
 Jesus is Lord! Yet from His throne eternal
 In flesh He came to die in pain
 On Calvary's tree.
 Jesus is Lord! From Him all life proceeding,
 Yet gave His life a ransom
 Thus setting us free.
[V3]
 Jesus is Lord! O'er sin the mighty conqueror,
 From death He rose, and all His foes
 Shall own His name.
 Jesus is Lord! God sent His Holy Spirit
 To show by works of power
 That Jesus is Lord.
