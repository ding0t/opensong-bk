[V1]
 The King is among us,
 His Spirit is here,
 Let's draw near and worship,
 Let songs fill the air.
[V2]
 He looks down upon us,
 Delight in His face,
 Enjoying His children's love,
 Enthralled by our praise.
[V3]
 For each child is special,
 Accepted and loved,
 A love gift from Jesus
 To His Father above.
[V4]
 And now He is giving
 His gifts to us all,
 For no one is worthless
 And each one is called.
[V5]
 The Spirit's anointing
 On all flesh comes down,
 And we shall be channels
 For works like His own.
[V6]
 We come now believing
 Your promise of power,
 For we are Your people
 And this is Your hour.
[V7]
 The King is among us,
 His Spirit is here,
 Let's draw near and worship,
 Let songs fill the air.
