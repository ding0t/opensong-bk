[V1]
 I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart,
 I will enter His courts with praise;
 I will say this is the day that the Lord has made,
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
[C]
 He has made me glad,
 He has made me glad,
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
 He has made me glad,
 He has made me glad,
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
