[V1]
 All hail the power of Jesus' name!
 Let angels prostrate fall;
 Bring forth the royal diadem,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
[V2]
 Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
 Who from His altar call;
 Extol Him in whose path ye trod,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
[V3]
 Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
 Ye ransomed of the fall,
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
[V4]
 Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
 The wormwood and the gall,
 Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
[V5]
 Let every kindred, every tribe
 On this terrestrial ball,
 To Him all majesty ascribe,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
[V6]
 O that, with yonder sacred throng,
 We at His feet may fall,
 Join in the everlasting song,
 And crown Him Lord of all!
