[C]
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 Give thanks to the risen Lord,
 Alleluia, alleluia, give praise to His name.
[V1]
 Jesus is Lord of all the earth,
 He is the King of creation.
[V2]
 Spread the good news o'er all the earth,
 Jesus has died and has risen.
[V3]
 We have been crucified with Christ,
 Now we shall live forever.
[V4]
 God has proclaimed the just reward,
 Life for all men, alleluia!
[V5]
 Come let us praise the living God,
 Joyfully sing to our Saviour.
