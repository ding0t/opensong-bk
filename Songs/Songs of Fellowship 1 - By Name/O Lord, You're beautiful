  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O Lord, You're beautiful, 
 Your face is all I seek, 
 For when Your eyes are on this child, 
 Your grace abounds to me.
[V2]
 O Lord, please light the fire 
 That once burned bright and clear, 
 Replace the lamp of my first love 
 That burns with holy fear!
[V3]
 I wanna take Your word 
 And shine it all around, 
 But first help me just to live it, Lord! 
 And when I'm doing well, 
 Help me to never seek a crown, 
 For my reward is giving glory to You.
