[V1]
 The head that once was crowned with thorns
 Is crowned with glory now;
 A royal diadem adorns
 The mighty Victor's brow.
[V2]
 The highest place that heaven affords
 Is His by sovereign right,
 The King of kings, the Lord of Lords,
 And heaven's eternal light.
[V3]
 The joy of all who dwell above,
 The joy of all below,
 To whom He manifests His love,
 And grants His name to know.
[V4]
 To them the cross, with all its shame,
 With all its grace, is given;
 Their name an everlasting name,
 Their joy the joy of heaven.
[V5]
 They suffer with their Lord below,
 They reign with Him above;
 Their profit and their joy to know
 The mystery of His love.
[V6]
 The cross He bore is life and health,
 Though shame and death to Him;
 His people's hope, His people's wealth,
 Their everlasting theme.
