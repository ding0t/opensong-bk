[V1]
 Praise to the holiest in the height, 
 And in the depth be praise; 
 In all His words most wonderful, 
 Most sure in all His ways.
[V2]
 O loving wisdom of our God! 
 When all was sin and shame, 
 A second Adam to the fight 
 And to the rescue came.
[V3]
 O wisest love! that flesh and blood, 
 Which did in Adam fail, 
 Should strive afresh against the foe, 
 Should strive and should prevail;
[V4]
 And that a higher gift than grace 
 Should flesh and blood refine,
 God's presence and His very self, 
 And essence all-divine.
[V5]
 O generous love! that He, who smote 
 In Man for man the foe, 
 The double agony in Man 
 For man should undergo;
[V6]
 And in the garden secretly, 
 And on the cross on high, 
 Should teach His brethren, and inspire 
 To suffer and to die.
[V7]
 Praise to the Holiest in the height,
 And to the depth be praise;
 In all His words most wonderful,
 Most sure in all His ways.
