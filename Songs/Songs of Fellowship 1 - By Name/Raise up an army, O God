  <lyrics>
[C]
 Raise up an army, O God,
 Awake Your people throughout the earth.
 Raise up an army, O God,
 To proclaim Your kingdom,
 To declare Your word,
 To declare Your glory, O God.
[V1]
 Our hope, our heart, our vision,
 To see in every land
 Your chosen people coming forth.
 Fulfilling Your holy mission,
 United as we stand,
 Pledging our lives unto You, Lord.
[V2]
 O God, our glorious Maker,
 We marvel at Your grace,
 That You would use us in Your plan.
 Rejoicing at Your favour,
 Delighting in Your ways,
 We'll gladly follow Your command!
