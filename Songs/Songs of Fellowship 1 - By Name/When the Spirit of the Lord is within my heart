[V1]
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will sing as David sang.
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will sing as David sang.
[C1]
 I will sing, I will sing,
 I will sing as David sang.
 I will sing, I will sing,
 I will sing as David sang.
[V2]
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will clap as David clapped.
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will clap as David clapped.
[C2]
 I will clap, I will clap,
 I will clap as David clapped.
 I will clap, I will clap,
 I will clap as David clapped.
[V3]
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will dance as David danced.
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will dance as David danced.
[C3]
 I will dance, I will dance,
 I will dance as David danced.
 I will dance, I will dance,
 I will dance as David danced.
[V4]
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will praise as David praised.
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
 I will praise as David praised.
[C4]
 I will praise, I will praise,
 I will praise as David praised.
 I will praise, I will praise,
 I will praise as David praised.
