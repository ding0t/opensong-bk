  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I was made to praise You,
 I was made to glorify Your name,
 In every circumstance
 To find a chance to thank You.
 I was made to love You
 I was made to worship at Your feet,
 And to obey You, Lord.
 I was made for You.
[V2]
 I will always praise You,
 I will always glorify Your name.
 In every circumstance
 I'll find a chance to thank You.
 I will always love You,
 I will always worship at Your feet,
 And I'll obey You, Lord.
 I was made for You.
