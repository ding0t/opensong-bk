  <lyrics>
[V1]
 He came to earth, not to be served,
 But gave His life to be a ransom for many;
 The Son of God, the Son of man,
 He shared our pain and bore our sins in His body.
[C]
 King of kings and Lord of Lords,
 I lift my voice in praise;
 Such amazing love, but I do believe
 This King has died for me.
[V2]
 And so I stand, a broken soul,
 To see the pain that I have brought to Jesus;
 And yet each heart will be consoled,
 To be made new, the joy of all believers.
[V3]
 And from now on, through all my days,
 I vow to live each moment here for Jesus;
 Not looking back, but giving praise
 For all my Lord has done for this believer.
