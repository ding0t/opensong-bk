  <lyrics>
[C]
 O Lord, our Lord, 
 How excellent is Your name in all the earth.
 O Lord, our Lord, 
 How excellent is Your name in all the earth.
[V1]
 You have set Your glory above the heavens, 
 From children's lips You have ordained praise;
 You have set the moon and the stars inplace, 
 And You still remember me.
[V2]
 What is man that You are mindful of him;
 The son of man that You take care of him? 
 You have put everything beneath his feet, 
 And made him ruler of Your works.
