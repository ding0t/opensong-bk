[V1]
 O Lord, most holy God, 
 Great are Your purposes, 
 Great is Your will for us, 
 Great is Your love. 
 And we rejoice in You, 
 And we will sing to You, 
 O Father, have Your way, 
 Your will be done.
[V2]
 For You are building 
 A temple without hands, 
 A city without walls 
 Enclosed by fire. 
 A place for You to dwell, 
 Built out of living stones, 
 Shaped by a Father's hand 
 And joined in love.
