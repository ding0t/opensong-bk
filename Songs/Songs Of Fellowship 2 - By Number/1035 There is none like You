  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There is none like You,
 No one else can touch my heart like You do.
 I could search for all eternity long and find
 There is none like You.
[V2]
 Your mercy flows like a river wide,
 And healing comes from Your hands.
 Suffering children are safe in Your arms;
 There is none like You.
