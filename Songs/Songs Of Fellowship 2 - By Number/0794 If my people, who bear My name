  <lyrics>
[V1]
 If my people, who bear My name,
 Will humble themselves and pray;
 If they seek My presence
 And turn their backs on their wicked ways:
 ||Then I will hear from heaven,
 I'll hear from heaven and will forgive;
 I will forgive their sins
 And will heal their land,
 Yes, I will heal their land.
