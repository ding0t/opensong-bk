  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God of heaven, with the heart of a lover;
 Conquering King, with compassion in His voice.
 Sovereign Lord, with the care of a mother;
 To You we bring our lives, knowing You will take us in.
[V2]
 Jesus Christ, You're the Alpha and Omega:
 King of kings, who laid aside His crown.
 Man of woes, but a Friend to the friendless:
 To You we bring our fears, knowing You will set us free.
[V3]
 So let's be pure and holy, set apart for Jesus;
 A covenant people, who reflect the heart of God.
 With outstretched hands of mercy to the broken-hearted,
 A covenant people who reveal the love of God.
