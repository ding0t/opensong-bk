  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Far above all other loves,
 Far beyond all other joys,
 Heaven's blessings poured on me,
 By the Holy Spirit's power.
[C]
 Love's compelling power
 Draws my heart into Yours;
 Jesus, how I love You,
 You're my Friend and my Lord.
 You have died and risen
 So what else can I say?
 How I love You, Lord,
 Love You, Lord.
[V2]
 All ambition now has gone,
 Pleasing You my only goal;
 Motivated by Your grace,
 Living for eternity.
[V3]
 Looking with the eye of faith
 For the day of Your return;
 In that day I want to stand
 Unashamed before Your throne.
