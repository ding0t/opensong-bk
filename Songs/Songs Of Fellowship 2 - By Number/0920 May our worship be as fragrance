[V1]
 May our worship be as fragrance,
 May our worship be as incense poured forth,
 May our worship be acceptable
 As a living sacrifice,
 As a living sacrifice.
[V2]
 We are willing to pay the price,
 We are willing to lay down our lives
 As an offering of obedience,
 As a living sacrifice,
 As a living sacrifice.
