[V1]
 It's getting clearer, the light is dawning,
 I'm pressing on to a higher place.
 The past behind me, I'm moving forward,
 And I will follow after You.
[C]
 You are my strength, You are my shield,
 You are the Rock on which I want to build my life,
 O Lord, O Lord.
 I won't compromise, I won't be denied,
 I want to keep my eyes on the prize
 Of knowing You, knowing You.
[V2]
 There is a passion that burns within me,
 I long to see Your kingdom come.
 To know Your presence, to seek no other;
 I hunger, Lord, for more of You.
