[V1]
 My trust is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth;
 My trust is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth.
[C]
 Sing hallelujah, hallelujah.
 Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah.
[V2]
 My hope is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth;
 My hope is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth;
[V3]
 My joy is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth;
 My joy is in the name of the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth;
