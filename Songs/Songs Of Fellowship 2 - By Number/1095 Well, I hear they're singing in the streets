[V1]
 Well, I hear they're singing in the streets
 That Jesus is alive,
 And all creation shouts aloud
 That Jesus is alive.
 Now surely we can all be changed
 'cause Jesus is alive;
 And everybody here can know
 That Jesus is alive.
[B]
 And I will live for all my days
 To raise a banner of truth and light,
 To sing about my Saviour's love -
 And the best thing that happened,
 It was the day I met You.
[C]
 I've found Jesus.
 I've found Jesus.
 I've found Jesus.
 I've found Jesus.
[V2]
 Well, I feel like dancing in the streets
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
 To join with all who celebrate
 That Jesus is alive.
 The joy of God is in this town
 'Cause Jesus is alive;
 For everybody's seen the truth
 That Jesus is alive.
[V3]
 Well, You lifted me from where I was,
 Set my feet upon a rock,
 Humbled that You even know about me.
 Now I have chosen to believe,
 Believing that You've chosen me;
 I was lost but now I've found...
