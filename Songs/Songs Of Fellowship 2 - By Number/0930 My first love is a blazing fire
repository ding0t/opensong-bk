  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My first love is a blazing fire,
 I feel His powerful love in me.
 For He has kindled a flame of passion,
 And I will let it grow in me.
 ||And in the night I will sing Your praise, my love.
 And in the morning I will seek Your face, my love.
[C]
 And like a child I will dance in Your presence,
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me.
 I still remember the first day I met You,
 And I don't ever want to lose that fire,
 My first love.
[V2]
 My first love is a rushing river,
 A waterfall that will never cease;
 And in the torrent of tears and laughter,
 I feel a healing power released.
 ||And I will draw from Your well of life, my love,
 And in Your grace I'll be satisfied, my love.
[V3]
 Restore the years of the church's slumber,
 Revive the fire that has grown so dim;
 Renew the love of those first encounters,
 That we may come alive again.
 ||And we will rise like the dawn throughout the earth,
 Until the trumpet announces Your return.
