[C]
 Release Your power among us, Lord,
 That all may see Your glory.
 Release Your power among us, Lord,
 That all may see Your glory.
[V1]
 Lord, I give my life to You,
 And trust Your holy name;
 Help me grow in holiness,
 And follow You in all Your ways.
 Send Your Holy Spirit,
 That I may truly be
 Cleansed within my heart
 And free from all impurity.
[V2]
 O Lord, as we come trusting our way to You,
 Make our righteousness shine like the dawn.
[V3]
 Teach me, Lord, to listen
 To the calling of Your Spirit,
 Helping me and guiding me
 To live my life as Jesus did.
 I long to know Your power
 And see the sick get healed;
 Come and move among us, Lord,
 That truth will be revealed.
