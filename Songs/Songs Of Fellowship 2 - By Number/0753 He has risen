[C]
 He has risen,
 He has risen,
 He has risen,
 Jesus is alive.
[V1]
 When the life flowed from His body,
 Seemed like Jesus' mission failed.
 But His sacrifice accomplished,
 Victory over sin and hell.
[V2]
 In the grave God did not leave Him,
 For His body to decay;
 Raised to life, the great awakening,
 Satan's power He overcame.
[V3]
 If there were no resurrection,
 We ourselves could not be raised;
 But the Son of God is living,
 So our hope is not in vain.
[V4]
 When the Lord rides out of heaven,
 Mighty angels at His side,
 They will sound the final trumpet,
 From the grave we shall arise.
[V5]
 He has given life immortal,
 We shall see Him face to face;
 Through eternity we'll praise Him,
 Christ, the Champion of our faith.
