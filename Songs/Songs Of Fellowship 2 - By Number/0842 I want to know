  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I want to know
 The glorious inheritance
 That You have given to me.
 And I want to know
 The hope that You have called me to,
 O Lord, I want to know Your truth.
[C]
 I want to know You better,
 The Spirit without measure,
 To know the fulness that's in You.
 I want to know Your mystery,
 The grace You've given freely,
 I know my life is hidden in You.
[V2]
 I want to know
 Your wisdom and Your revelation,
 Drawing me to You.
 I want to know
 The power of Your mighty strength
 Which raised
 Jesus from the dead.
