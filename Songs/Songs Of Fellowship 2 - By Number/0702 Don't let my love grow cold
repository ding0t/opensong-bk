[V1]
 Don't let my love grow cold;
 I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
 Don't let my vision die;
 I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
[V2]
 You know my heart, my deeds;
 I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
 I need Your discipline;
 I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
[V3]
 I am here to buy gold,
 Refined in the fire:
 Naked and poor,
 Wretched and blind, I come.
 Clothe me in white,
 So I won't be ashamed:
 Lord, light the fire again!
