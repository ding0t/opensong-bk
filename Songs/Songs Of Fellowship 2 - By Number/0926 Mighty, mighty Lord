[V1]
 Mighty, mighty Lord.
 Precious is Your name.
 Wonderful Your ways,
 Worthy of all praise, Jehovah.
[V2]
 Mighty, mighty Lord.
 Holy is Your name.
 Glorious and true,
 Great in all You do, Jehovah,
 Jehovah.
[V3]
 Hallowed be Your name,
 Lord God Almighty,
 For Yours is the kingdom,
 The power and the glory,
 Forever more.
