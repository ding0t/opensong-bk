[V1]
 This is my beloved son
 Who tasted death
 That you, my child, might live.
 See the blood He shed for you,
 What suffering!
 ||Say what more could He give?
 Clothed in His perfection,
 Bring praise, a fragrance sweet,
 Garlanded with joy,
 Come worship at His feet:
[C1]
 That the Lamb who was slain
 Might receive the reward,
 Might receive the reward of His suffering.
[V2]
 Look, the world's great harvest fields
 Are ready now,
 And Christ commands us: 'Go!'
 Countless souls are dying
 So hopelessly,
 ||His wondrous love unknown.
 Lord, give us the nations
 For the glory of the King.
 Father, send more labourers,
 The lost to gather in.
[V3]
 Come the day when we will stand
 There face to face,
 What joy will fill His eyes.
 For at last His Bride appears,
 So beautiful,
 ||Her glory fills the skies.
 Drawn from every nation,
 People, tribe and tongue;
 All creation sings,
 The wedding has begun.
[C2]
 And the Lamb who was slain
 Shall receive the reward,
 Shall receive the reward of His suffering.
