[V1]
 5000+ hungry folk,
 5000+ hungry folk,
 5000+ hungry folk
 Came 4 2 listen 2 Jesus.
[V2]
 The 6 x 2 said 0 0 0,
 The 6 x 2 said 0 0 0,
 The 6 x 2 said 0 0 0,
 Where can I get some food from?
[V3]
 Just 1 had 1 2 3 4 5,
 Just 1 had 1 2 3 4 5,
 Just 1 had 1 2 3 4 5,
 Loaves and 1 2 fishes.
[V4]
 When Jesus blessed the 5 + 2,
 When Jesus blessed the 5 + 2,
 When Jesus blessed the 5 + 2,
 They were increased many x over.
[V5]
 5000 + 8 it up,
 5000 + 8 it up,
 5000 + 8 it up,
 With 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 basketfuls left over.
