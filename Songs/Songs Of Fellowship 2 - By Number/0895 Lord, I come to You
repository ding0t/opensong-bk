  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, I come to You,
 Let my heart be changed, renewed,
 Flowing from the grace
 That I found in You.
 And Lord, I've come to know
 The weaknesses I see in me
 Will be stripped away
 By the power of Your love.
[C]
 Hold me close,
 Let Your love surround me.
 Bring me near, draw me to Your side.
 And as I wait
 I'll rise up like the eagle,
 And I will soar with You,
 Your Spirit leads me on
 In the power of Your love.
[V2]
 Lord, unveil my eyes,
 Let me see You face to face,
 The knowledge of Your love
 As You live in me.
 Lord, renew my mind
 As Your will unfolds in my life,
 In living every day
 By the power of Your love.
