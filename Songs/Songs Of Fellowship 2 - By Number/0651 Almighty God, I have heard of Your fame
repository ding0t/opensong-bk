  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Almighty God, I have heard of Your fame;
 I stand in awe of Your wondrous deeds.
 The heavens declare Your glorious name;
 I worship You above all my needs.
[V2]
 The skies display the work of Your hands,
 I will praise You for the rest of my days.
 Who can You ask to approve Your plans?
 For You are sovereign in all of Your ways.
[C]
 I will only worship You,
 There is nothing I want more
 Than to be with You,
 More and more I love You, Lord.
 The only One I bow before,
 I worship You with all that You've put in me;
 This is what You made me for.
