  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I know You love to crown the humble,
 Pouring out grace for the broken heart.
 You bless the meek, You meet the lowly;
 Lord, as I bow, lift me to You.
[C]
 I keep on bowing down, bowing down,
 Keep on bowing down,
 What else can I do?
 Keep on bowing down, bowing down.
 What else can I do,
 To give it all to You?
[V2]
 I'd like to be one such believer,
 Keeping my knees firmly on the ground.
 I'd like to tread humbly before You;
 Lord, as I bow, lift me to You.
[V3]
 Do You smile when You see
 A humble believer on their knees?
 And my Lord, will You be pleased
 To look upon me, to look upon me?
