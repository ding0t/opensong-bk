[V1]
 I have heard that You are swift to bless the seeker,
 And I believe that You will hear the constant cry;
 So I will call until I know I've had ananswer,
 I need Your power, Lord!
 ||As Jacob wrestled, so I'll wrestle with Your angel,
 And though I'm weary, I will not be overcome;
 For You have given me a passion for Your kingdom,
 O let Your glory fall!
[C]
 I won't let go,
 I won't let go until You bless me.
 I won't take no for an answer;
 Jesus, I won't let go!
[V2]
 I have heard that You show mercy to a nation,
 And I believe that You give power to Your church;
 So now I'm asking You to open up the heavens,
 Pour out Your mercy, Lord!
 ||For Your gospel to be lived among Your people,
 For Your miracle of healing on the streets;
 For the government to fear the Lord Almighty,
 We need Your power, Lord!
[V3]
 I'm not ungrateful for the blessings You have given,
 But I can see the need around me;
 I'm not ashamed to say I need all that You have,
 So Father, hear me knocking,
 See me holding out my hands to You.
[V4]
 For a hunger that will overcome my weakness,
 For a love that will not seek its own reward;
 For my life to make a difference in this nation,
 I need Your power, Lord!
