[V1]
 Holy, holy, holy, holy,
 Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
 And we lift our hearts before You
 As a token of our love:
 Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[V2]
 Gracious Father, gracious Father,
 We're so glad to be Your children, gracious Father;
 And we lift our heads before You
 As a token of our love,
 Gracious Father, gracious Father.
[V3]
 Precious Jesus, precious Jesus,
 We're so glad that You've redeemed us, precious Jesus;
 And we lift our hands before You
 As a token of our love,
 Precious Jesus, precious Jesus,
[V4]
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
 Come and fill our hearts anew, Holy Spirit.
 And we lift our voice before You
 As a token of our love,
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit.
[V5]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah -
 And we lift our hearts before You
 As a token of our love,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.
