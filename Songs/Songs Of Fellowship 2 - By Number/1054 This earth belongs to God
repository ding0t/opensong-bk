[V1]
 This earth belongs to God,
 The world, its wealth, and all its people;
 He formed the waters wide
 And fashioned every sea and shore.
 ||Who may go up the hill of the Lord
 And stand in the place of holiness?
 Only the one whose heart is pure,
 Whose hands and lips are clean.
[V2]
 Lift high your heads, you gates,
 Rise up, you everlasting doors,
 As here now the King of glory
 Enters into full command.
 ||Who is the King, this King of glory?
 Where is the throne He comes to claim?
 Christ is the King, the Lord of glory,
 Fresh from His victory.
[V3]
 Lift high your heads, you gates,
 And fling wide open the ancient doors,
 For here the King of glory
 Takes universal power.
 ||Who is this king, this King of glory,
 What is the power by which He reigns?
 Christ is the King, His cross of glory,
 And by love He rules.
[V4]
 All glory be to God
 The Father, Son and Holy Spirit;
 From ages past it was,
 Is now, and ever more shall be.
