  <lyrics>
[V1]
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,
 O Lord Almighty.
 My soul longs and even faints for You.
 For here my heart is satisfied,
 Within Your presence.
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.
[C]
 Better is one day in Your courts,
 Better is one day in Your house,
 Better is one day in Your courts
 Than thousands elsewhere.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 One thing I ask and I would seek;
 To see Your beauty,
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells.
[V3]
 My heart and flesh cry out
 For You, the living God;
 Your Spirit's water for my soul.
 I've tasted and I've seen,
 Come once again to me;
 I will draw near to You,
 I will draw near to You.
