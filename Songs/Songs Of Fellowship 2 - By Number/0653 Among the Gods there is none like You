[V1]
 Among the Gods there is none like You,
 O Lord, O Lord.
 There are no deeds to compare with Yours, O Lord.
 All the nations You have made will come;
 They'll worship before You, O Lord,
 O Lord.
[C]
 For You are great and do marvellous deeds.
 Yes, You are great and do marvellous deeds.
 You alone are God, You alone are God.
[V2]
 You are so good and forgiving,
 O Lord, O Lord.
 You're rich in love to all who call to You.
 All the nations You have made will come;
 They'll glorify Your name, O Lord,
 O Lord.
[V3]
 Teach me Your ways, O Lord,
 And I'll walk in Your truth.
 Give me an undivided heart,
 That I may fear Your name.
