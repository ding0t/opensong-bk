  <lyrics>
[V1]
 They that wait on the Lord
 Will renew their strength,
 Run and not get weary,
 Walk and not faint.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Do you not know?
 Have you not heard?
 My Father does not get weary.
 He'll give passion to a willing heart:
 Even the youths get tired and faint,
 But strength will come for those who wait.
[V3]
 If you wait on the Lord
 You'll renew your strength,
 Run and not get weary,
 Walk and not faint.
 (Repeat)
[V4]
 I will wait, I will wait, I will wait on You;
 I will run, I will run, I will run with You;
 My love, my love, my love for You.
