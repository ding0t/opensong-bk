[C]
 Come and join the celebration,
 It's a very special day;
 Come and share our jubilation,
 There's a new King born today!
[V1]
 See the shepherds
 Hurry down to Bethlehem;
 Gaze in wonder
 At the Son of God who lay before them.
[V2]
 Wise men journey,
 Led to worship by a star,
 Kneel in homage,
 Bringing precious gifts from lands afar, so
[V3]
 'God is with us,'
 'round the world the message bring;
 He is with us,
 'Welcome!' all the bells on earth are pealing.
