[V1]
 Over the mountains and the sea
 Your river runs with love for me,
 And I will open up my heart,
 And let the Healer set me free.
 I'm happy to be in the truth,
 And I will daily lift my hands,
 For I will always sing of
 When Your love came down, yeah.
[C]
 I could sing of Your love forever,
 I could sing of Your love forever.
 I could sing of Your love forever,
 I could sing of Your love forever.
[V2]
 Oh, I feel like dancing,
 It's foolishness I know;
 But when the world has seen the light,
 They will dance with joy
 Like we're dancing now.
