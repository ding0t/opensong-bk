  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Come, let us worship Jesus,
 King of nations, Lord of all.
 Magnificent and glorious,
 Just and merciful.
[C]
 Jesus, King of the nations,
 Jesus, Lord of all.
 Jesus, King of the nations,
 Lord of all.
[V2]
 Lavish our hearts' affection,
 Deepest love and highest praise.
 Voice, race and language blending,
 All the world amazed.
[V3]
 Bring tributes from the nations,
 Come in joyful cavalcades,
 One thunderous acclamation,
 One banner raised.
[V4]
 Come, Lord, and fill Your temple,
 Glorify Your dwelling place,
 Till nations see Your splendour
 And seek Your face.
[V5]
 Fear God and give Him glory,
 For His hour of judgement comes.
 Creator, Lord Almighty,
 Worship Him alone.
