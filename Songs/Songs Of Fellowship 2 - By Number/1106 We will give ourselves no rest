[V1]
 We will give ourselves no rest
 Till Your kingdom comes on earth;
 You've positioned watchmen on the walls.
 Now our prayers will flow like tears,
 For You've shared Your heart with us;
 God of heaven, on our knees we fall.
 ||Come down in power,
 Reveal Your heart again;
 Come hear our cries,
 The tears that plead for rain.
[C]
 We're knocking,
 Knocking on the door of heaven,
 We're crying,
 Crying for this generation;
 We're praying for Your name to be known
 In all of the earth.
 ||We're watching,
 Watching on the walls to see You,
 We're looking,
 Looking for a time of breakthrough;
 We're praying for Your word to bear fruit
 In all of the earth, in all of the earth.
