[V1]
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
 No mind has conceived what the Lord has prepared;
 But by His Spirit, He has revealed
 His plan to those who love Him.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 We've been held by His everlasting love,
 Led with loving kindness by His hand;
 We have hope for the future yet to come,
 In time we'll understand the mystery of His plan.
