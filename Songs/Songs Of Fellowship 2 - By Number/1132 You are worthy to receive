  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are worthy to receive
 All the honour and praise.
 Lamb of God, Prince of Peace,
 We lift high Your name.
[C]
 For Yours is the greatness,
 The power and the glory;
 Lord of the nations,
 Have mercy on us.
 Though heaven be shaken,
 And earth's kingdoms fall,
 We will still worship You.
[V2]
 In the footsteps of our King,
 We walk unafraid;
 Though the battle may rage,
 Our praises will ring.
