[V1]
 Be glorified, be glorified.
 Be glorified, be glorified.
 Be glorified in the heavens,
 Be glorified in the earth;
 Be glorified in the temple,
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Be Thou glorified.
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Be Thou glorified.
[V2]
 Worship the Lord, worship the Lord.
 Worship the Lord, worship the Lord.
 Worship the Lord in the heavens,
 Worship the Lord in the earth;
 Worship the Lord in the temple,
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Be Thou glorified.
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Be Thou glorified.
