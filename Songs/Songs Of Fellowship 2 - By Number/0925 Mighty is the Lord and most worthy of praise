[V1]
 Mighty is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
 Praise Him all you people.
 Look upon Him, God alone who saves:
 Praise the Lord of all.
 ||Nations will rise and nations will fall,
 Praise Him all you people.
 But there is One who is Lord of all:
 Praise the Lord of all.
[C]
 He is Wonderful, Counsellor,
 Glorious Prince of Peace.
 He is Lord and King of everything,
 His praises never cease.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Awesome and great, like the strongest tower,
 Praise Him all you people.
 He is the one with limitless power,
 Praise the Lord of all.
 ||Leaders may come and presidents fall,
 Praise Him all you people.
 But there is One who is Lord of all:
 Praise the Lord of all.
