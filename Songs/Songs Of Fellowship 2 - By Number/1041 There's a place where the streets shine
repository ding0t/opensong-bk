  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There's a place where the streets shine
 With the glory of the Lamb.
 There's a way, we can go there,
 We can live there beyond time.
[C1]
 Because of You, because of You,
 Because of Your love,
 Because of Your blood.
[V2]
 No more pain, no more sadness,
 No more suffering, no more tears.
 No more sin, no more sickness,
 No injustice, no more death.
[C2]
 All our sins are washed away,
 And we can live forever,
 Now we have this hope,
 Because of You.
 Oh, we'll see You face to face,
 And we will dance together
 In the city of our God,
 Because of You.
[V3]
 There is joy everlasting,
 There is gladness, there is peace.
 There is wine ever flowing,
 There's a wedding, there's a feast.
