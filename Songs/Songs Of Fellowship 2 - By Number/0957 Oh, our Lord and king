[C]
 Oh, our Lord and King,
 Our praise to You we bring,
 There is no other Rock but You.
 Seated high above,
 You are the One we love,
 This is our song of praise to You.
[V1]
 King forever!
 You are the First and You're the Last.
 You are sovereign;
 All Your commands will always
 Come to pass, to give You glory!
[V2]
 Who is like You?
 Who else is worthy of pur praise?
 We exalt You;
 You reign in majesty and
 Awesome splendour,
 King forever!
[V3]
 Abba Father,
 Your steadfast love will never fail.
 You are faithful,
 You are God and I will
 Worship in Your
 Courts for ever.
