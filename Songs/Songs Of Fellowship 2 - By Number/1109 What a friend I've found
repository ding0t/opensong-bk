  <lyrics>
[V1]
 What a friend I've found,
 Closer than a brother;
 I have felt Your touch,
 More intimate than lovers.
[C]
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, 
 Friend forever.
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 Friend forever.
[V2]
 What a hope I've found,
 More faithful than a mother;
 It would break my heart
 To ever lose each other.
