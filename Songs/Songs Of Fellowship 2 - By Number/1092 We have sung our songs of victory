[V1]
 We have sung our songs of victory,
 We have prayed to You for rain;
 We have cried for Your compassion
 To renew the land again.
 Now we're standing in Your presence,
 More hungry than before;
 Now we're on Your steps of mercy,
 And we're knocking at Your door.
[C1]
 How long 
 before You drench the barren land?
 How long
 before we see Your righteous hand?
 How long
 before Your name is lifted high?
 How long
 before the weeping turns to songs of joy?
[V2]
 Lord, we know Your heart is broken
 By the evil that You see,
 And You've stayed Your hand of judgement
 For You plan to set men free.
 But the land is still in darkness,
 And we've fled from what is right;
 We have failed the silent children
 Who will never see the light.
[V3]
 But I know a day is coming
 When the deaf will hear His voice,
 When the blind will see their Saviour,
 And the lame will leap for joy.
 When the widow finds a Husband
 Who will always love His bride,
 And the orphan finds a Father
 Who will never leave her side.
[C2]
 How long
 before Your glory lights the skies?
 How long
 before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
 How long
 before Your fragrance fills the air?
 How long
 before the earth resounds with songs of joy?
