  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Send us the rain, Lord,
 Rain of Your Spirit,
 Rain on this dry barren land.
 Send us the rain, Lord,
 Rain to revive us;
 Cleanse us and fill us again.
 ||Here we are, of one accord,
 Calling to You, singing:
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send the rain on us again.
[V2]
 Pour out Your wine, Lord,
 Wine of Your Spirit,
 Wine that would teach us to love.
 Pour out Your wine, Lord,
 Oh, how we need You
 To quench the thirst of our hearts.
 ||Here we are, of one accord,
 Calling to You, singing:
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send Your Spirit,
 Pour Your wine on us again.
[V3]
 Breathe now upon us,
 Breath of Your Spirit,
 Breath to bring life to these bones.
 Breathe now upon us,
 Life of abundance,
 Holiness, wisdom, love, truth.
 ||Here we are, of one accord,
 Calling to You, singing:
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send Your Spirit,
 Breathe Your life on us again.
[V4]
 Send down the fire,
 Fire of Your Spirit,
 Refiner's fire to fulfil.
 Send down the fire,
 Fire to consume us,
 Reveal Your power once more.
 ||Here we are, of one accord,
 Calling to You, singing:
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send Your Spirit,
 Send the fire on us again.
