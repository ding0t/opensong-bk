  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I would rather be a doorkeeper in your house,
 Than have the many things this world could offer.
 All that I have gained I now count as loss,
 There's nothing that compares to knowing You.
[C]
 In Your presence is where I want to be,
 The place where You reveal Your grace and glory.
 Your presence brings me to my knees,
 I bow down and declare that You are holy.
[V2]
 I would rather have one day in Your courts, O Lord,
 Than have a thousand days somewhere else.
 You are my sun and shield,
 No good thing will you withhold,
 For blessed are the ones who trust in You.
