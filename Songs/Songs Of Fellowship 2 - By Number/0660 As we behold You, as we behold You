[V1]
 As we behold You, as we behold You,
 We are changing into Your image.
 As we behold You, as we behold You,
 We are changing from glory to glory.
[V2]
 As we behold You in all of Your glory,
 Lord, by Your Spirit we are changing
 Into Your image from glory to glory,
 As we behold You, living God.
