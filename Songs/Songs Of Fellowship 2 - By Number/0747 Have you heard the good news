[C]
 Have you heard the good news?
 Have you heard the good news?
 We can live in hope
 Because of what the Lord has done.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 There is a way
 When there seems to be no way,
 There is a light in the darkness:
 There is a hope,
 An everlasting hope,
 There is a God who can help us.
[V2]
 A hope for justice
 And a hope for peace,
 A hope for those in desperation:
 We have a future,
 If only we believe
 He works in every situation.
