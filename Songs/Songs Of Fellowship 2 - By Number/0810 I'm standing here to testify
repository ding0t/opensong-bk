  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I'm standing here to testify, (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 To sing of how He changed my heart. (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 ||I was bound by hate and pride, (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 Never knowing of His light. (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
[V2]
 I did not think I could have peace, (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 Trapped inside by fear and shame. (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 ||He wiped away all of my grief, (Leader)
 O, the Lord is good. (All)
 When I believed upon His name. (Leader)
[C1]
 Come to the light, come as you are;
 You can be the friend of God.
 Humble yourself, give Him your heart,
 He will meet you where you are.
 (Last chorus)
[C2]
 Come to the light, just as you are;
 Fall on the Rock for the wasted years.
 He will restore all that was lost,
 Surrender now, His power is here.
 
 Clap Your hands, O God.
 Clap Your hands, O God.
 (Repeat)
