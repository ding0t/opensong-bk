[V1]
 There is a louder shout to come,
 There is a sweeter song to hear;
 All the nations with one voice,
 All the people with one fear.
 ||Bowing down before Your throne,
 Every tribe and tongue will be;
 All the nations with one voice,
 All the people with one King.
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.
[C]
 O what a song we'll sing and
 O what a tune we'll bear;
 You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
 O what a joy will rise and
 O what a sound we'll make;
 You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
[V2]
 Now we see a part of this,
 One day we shall see in full;
 All the nations with one voice,
 All the people with one love.
 ||No one else will share Your praise,
 Nothing else can take Your place;
 All the nations with one voice,
 All the people with one Lord.
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.
[V3]
 Even now upon the earth
 There's a glimpse of all to come;
 Many people with one voice,
 Harmony of many tongues.
 ||We will all confess Your name,
 You will be our only praise;
 All the nations with one voice,
 All the people with one God.
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.
