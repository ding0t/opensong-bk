[C]
 Come out of darkness into the light;
 Come out of darkness into the light.
 Come out of darkness into the arms of love,
 Into the arms of love.
[V1]
 To a world in darkness,
 To a world in pain,
 At this time You've called us,
 Your love to proclaim;
 Through Your willing people
 To the nations say,
 To the nations say:
[V2]
 Do not be discouraged,
 See what God has done;
 He is working through us,
 This world shall be won.
 There will be a harvest
 When the nations hear.
 What are they going to hear?
[V3]
 By the blood of Jesus sin is washed away;
 All who call upon Him, He will surely save.
 This will be the promise that the nations hear,
 When we sing it loud and clear.
