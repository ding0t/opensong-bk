[C]
 Spirit of holiness,
 Wisdom and faithfulness,
 Wind of the Lord,
 Blowing strongly and free:
 Strength of our serving
 And joy of our worshipping;
 Spirit of God,
 Bring Your fulness to me!
[V1]
 You came to interpret
 And teach us effectively
 All that the Saviour
 Has spoken and done;
 To glorify Jesus is all Your activity;
 Promise and Gift
 Of the Father and Son:
[V2]
 You came with Your gifts
 To supply all our poverty,
 Pouring Your love
 On the church in her need;
 You came with Your fruit
 For our growth to maturity,
 Richly refreshing
 The souls that You feed:
