[C]
 It's a wonderful, wonderful,
 Wonderful feeling,
 It's a wonderful feeling to
 Know you're saved.
 It's a wonderful, wonderful,
 Wonderful WONDERFUL!
 Wonderful feeling to
 Know you're saved.
[V1]
 My life is built on rock, not sand;
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
 And none can steal me from God's hand;
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
[V2]
 I once was lost but now I'm found:
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
 In Father's arms I'm safe and sound:
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
[V3]
 My old life's gone, I'm now brand new:
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
 Much less of me, much more of You:
 It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
