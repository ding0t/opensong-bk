[V1]
 Blessed be the name of the Lord,
 Blessed be the name of the Lord,
 Blessed be the name of the Lord Most High!
 (Repeat)
[C]
 The Name of the Lord is a strong tower,
 The righteous run into it,
 And they are saved.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Glory to the name of the Lord,
 Glory to the name of the Lord,
 Glory to the name of the Lord Most High!
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 Holy is the name of the Lord, 
 Holy is the name of the Lord, 
 Holy is the name of the Lord Most High!
 (Repeat)
