  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I long for You, O Lord.
 I long to know You more;
 I long to have Your heart placed in me every day.
 I long for, I long for You, O Lord.
[V2]
 I hunger to eat the bread
 Only You can give.
 I'm thirsting to drink Your water
 That I might live,
 To grow in You,
 To know in You
 My every desire is found.
