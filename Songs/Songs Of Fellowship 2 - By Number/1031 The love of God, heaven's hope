[V1]
 The love of God, heaven's hope;
 This perfect peace, this rest for my soul.
 This love divine, portrayed in pain,
 The cross stands alone,
 Unfailing love.
[V2]
 This love of God, creation's cry;
 Perfection portrayed, broken for me.
 The Author of life has suffered our pain.
 The cross stands alone,
 Unfailing love.
[C]
 The love of God was found in the nails;
 The love of God was seen in the scars.
 The light and the life was darkened by death,
 My hope and salvation carried to life,
 Unfailing love.
[V3]
 The love of God, written in blood;
 This empty grave, the stone rolled away!
 The mercy of God has triumphed in Christ.
 The cross stands alone,
 Unfailing love.
