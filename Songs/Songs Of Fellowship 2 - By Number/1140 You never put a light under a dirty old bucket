[V1]
 You never put a light under a dirty old bucket.
 You never put a light under a dirty old bucket.
 You never put a light under a dirty old bucket
 If you want light to shine around, round, round.
[V2]
 Shine, shine around, round round.
 Shine, shine around, round, round.
 Shine a light that everyone can see.
 Lord, help me let my little light shine,
 Not just Sundays, all the time,
 So friends give praise to You
 When they see me.
