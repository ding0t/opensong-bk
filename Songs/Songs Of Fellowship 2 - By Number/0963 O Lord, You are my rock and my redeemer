[C]
 O Lord, You are my rock and my redeemer;
 My song, You are the Strength of my life.
 O Lord, You are the Shepherd of Your people;
 You keep us always walking in Your light.
[V1]
 You brought me out of darkness,
 You took away my shame;
 You broke the chains that bound me,
 I praise Your name!
[V2]
 You carry all my sorrows,
 You carry all my pain;
 You fill me with Your Spirit,
 I praise Your name!
