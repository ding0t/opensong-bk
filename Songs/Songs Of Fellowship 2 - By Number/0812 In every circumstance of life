  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In every circumstance of life
 You are with me, glorious Father.
 And I have put my trust in You,
 That I may know the glorious hope
 To which I'm called.
 ||And by the power that works in me,
 You've raised me up and set me free;
 And now in every circumstance
 I'll prove Your love without a doubt,
 Your joy shall be my strength,
 Your joy shall be my strength.
