[V1]
 As the deer pants for the water,
 So my soul, it thirsts for You,
 For You, O God,
 For You, O God.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 When can I come before You
 And see Your face?
 My heart and my flesh cry out
 For the living God,
 For the living God.
[V3]
 Deep calls to deep
 At the thunder of Your waterfalls.
 Your heart of love is calling out to me.
 By this I know that I am Yours
 And You are mine.
 ||Your waves of love are breaking over me.
 Your waves of love are breaking over me.
 Your waves of love are breaking over me.
