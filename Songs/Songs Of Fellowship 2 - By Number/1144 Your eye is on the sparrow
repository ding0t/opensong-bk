  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Your eye is on the sparrow,
 And Your hand, it comforts me.
 From the ends of the earth
 To the depths of my heart,
 Let Your mercy and strength be seen.
 You call me to Your purpose,
 As angels understand.
 For Your glory may You draw all men,
 As Your love and grace demands.
[V2]
 And I will run to You,
 To Your words of truth;
 Not by might, not by power
 But by the Spirit of God.
 Yes, I will run the race,
 Till I see Your face.
 Oh, let me live in the glory of Your grace.
