  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You have taken the precious
 From the worthless and given us
 Beauty for ashes, love for hate.
 You have chosen the weak things
 Of the world to shame that which is strong,
 And the foolish things to shame the wise.
[V2]
 You are help to the helpless,
 Strength to the stranger,
 And a father to the child that's left alone.
 And the thirsty You've invited
 To come to the waters,
 And those who have no money, come and buy.
[C]
 So come, so come.
 So come, so come.
[V3]
 Behold the days are coming
 For the Lord has promised,
 That the ploughman will overtake thereaper.
 And our hearts will be the threshing floor,
 And the move of God we've cried out for
 Will come, it will surely come.
[V4]
 For You will shake the heavens,
 And fill Your house with glory,
 And turn the shame of the outcast intopraise.
 And all creation groans and waits
 For the Spirit and the Bride to say
 The word that Your heart has longed tohear.
