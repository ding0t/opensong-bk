[V1]
 We are marching to a different anthem,
 We are dancing to a different song;
 And our hearts have come alive with freedom,
 Mercy has come, the God of mercy has come.
 ||He is moving through the towns and cities,
 He is binding up the broken ones;
 And His healing hand is working wonders,
 See how they come, He sets them free when they come.
 And I sing:
[C]
 I love the God of heaven,
 I love His precious Son;
 And in the Holy Spirit,
 He's making us strong,
 And giving us the victory.
 ||I love the God of heaven,
 I love His precious Son;
 And in the Holy Spirit,
 He's making us strong,
 And giving us a victory song.
[V2]
 He is training up our hands for battle,
 And equipping us to take the land;
 For the promises to us are mighty,
 We will be strong, and move together as one.
 ||We are heading for our finest hour,
 When our Saviour will be magnified,
 And His glory will outshine all others:
 Jesus is Lord, let Him be praised and adored.
 And I sing:
