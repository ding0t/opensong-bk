  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We are salt and we are the light;
 We've come to break the powers of night,
 And by the love of God 
 proclaim His liberty.
 ||We're ambassadors of grace,
 In His name we take this place;
 Lord, let Your will be done,
 Let Your kingdom come,
 Lord, let it rain, let it rain.
[C]
 Let Your blessings pour
 On the nations, Lord, let it rain.
 Let Your blessings pour
 On the nations, Lord, let it rain.
 As we sing Your praises,
 Break the curses, let it rain.
 Hear Your people praying,
 Send Your blessing, let it rain.
 Oh, let it rain.
[V2]
 You have won the fight, O Lord;
 By Your death our life's been restored,
 And You have risen now
 To vanquish all our foes.
 ||Come, abolish every curse
 O'er the nations of the earth;
 In Your name we'll go,
 To proclaim You rose to live and reign.
 Lord, come and reign.
