  <lyrics>
[C]
 Rise up, let Your kingdom arise in us;
 We lift our eyes to the skies, and rise up
 To the brightness of His rising.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 All creation awaits
 The revealing of the sons of God,
 And all the angels of heaven
 Are listening for the prayers of us:
 Hearing the sound of a powerful flood,
 Saints of our God who've been bought by His blood.
[V2]
 The redemption of God
 Has given us a kingdom view,
 And His promise to us,
 The hope of glory, Christ in you.
 Darkness shall run from the strength of His hand,
 Our testimony, the blood of the Lamb.
