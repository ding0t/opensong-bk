  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In my life proclaim Your glory,
 In my heart reveal Your majesty;
 Then my soul shall speak the wonders of Your grace,
 And this heart of mine shall sing Your praise.
 ||In my words proclaim Your mercy,
 In my life reveal Your power;
 Then my soul shall be a mirror of Your love,
 And this heart of mine shall sing Your praise.
[C]
 Lord of all mercy, God of all grace,
 Lord of all righteousness;
 Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth
 Enthroned in majesty.
 Worthy of honour, worthy of praise,
 All glory and majesty;
 I give You the honour, I give You the praise,
 And proclaim Your glorious power.
[V2]
 In my soul unveil Your love, Lord,
 Deep within my heart renewing me.
 Day by day your life transforming all I am,
 As this heart of mine reflects Your praise.
 ||Lord of all, enthroned in glory,
 Grace and mercy, truth and righteousness,
 Every knee shall bow before this Christ, our Lord,
 As all creation sings Your praise.
