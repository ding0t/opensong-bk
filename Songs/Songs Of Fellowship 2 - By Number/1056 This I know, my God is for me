[C]
 This I know, my God is for me,
 This I know.
 This I know, my God is on my side;
 My God is for me, this I know.
[V1]
 If God did not spare His only Son,
 But delivered Him up for us all,
 Will He not give us every good thing
 When we come in His name and call?
[V2]
 Let us draw near the throne of grace
 For mercy and help in our need;
 For Jesus is ever praying for us,
 He is living to intercede.
