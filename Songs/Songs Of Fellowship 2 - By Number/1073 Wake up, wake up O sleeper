[C]
 Wake up, wake up O sleeper,
 And rise from the dead.
 Wake up, wake up O sleeper,
 And rise from the dead.
[V1]
 We are His people drawn by grace,
 Chosen by His glorious name,
 Called to give Him all our praise,
 Set apart to worship Him.
 ||We must be humble now and pray,
 And turn from all our careless ways,
 And in our hearts wait for the hour
 For Christ to come in awesome power.
[V2]
 We are called to righteousness,
 To be like God in holiness;
 So let all slander now subside,
 And flee from bitterness and rage.
 ||And soon the night will fade away,
 And in its place will come the day;
 So we must clothe ourselves in light,
 The armour that will help us fight.
 Revere the name of the Lord,
 And He will shine on you;
 He will arise with healing
 And set you free.
