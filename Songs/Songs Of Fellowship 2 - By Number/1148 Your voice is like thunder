[V1]
 Your voice is like thunder,
 Your eyes like fire;
 Your throne is forever,
 In unapproachable light.
 Your grace is so tender,
 Your love like wine;
 To You I surrender,
 I lay down my life.
[C1]
 And all I want to do 
 Is to build a house of gold,
 Purest silver and costly stones;
 Let it stand when the fire comes,
 When the day brings Your light.
 ||Be my wisdom and be my strength,
 Fill me up with Your faithfulness;
 Keep me loving until the end.
 Let the fire in Your eyes
 See a living sacrifice,
 Pleasing in Your sight.
[C2]
 Let me build a house of gold
 Purest silver and costly stones;
 Let it stand when the fire comes,
 When the day brings Your light.
 ||Be my wisdom and be my strength,
 Fill me up with Your faithfulness;
 Keep me loving until the end.
 Let the fire in Your eyes
 See a living sacrifice,
 Pleasing in Your sight.
