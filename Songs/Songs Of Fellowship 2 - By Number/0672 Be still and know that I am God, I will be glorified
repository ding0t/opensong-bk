[V1]
 Be still and know that I am God:
 I will be glorified and praised in all the earth.
 For My great name I will be found,
 And I can never be resisted,
 Never be undone;
 I'm never lacking power
 To glorify My Son.
 ||The gates of hell are falling
 And the church is coming forth,
 My name will be exalted in the earth.
[V2]
 Be still and know that I am God;
 I have poured out My Holy Spirit like a flood.
 The land that cries for holy rain
 Shall be inheriting her promises
 And dancing like a child;
 A holy monsoon deluge
 Shall bless the barren heights,
 ||And those who sat in silence
 Shall speak up and shall be heard:
 My name will be exalted in the earth.
[V3]
 Be still and know that I am God;
 My Son has asked me for
 The nations of the world.
 His sprinkled blood has made a way
 For all the multitudes of India andAfrica to come;
 The Middle East will find its peace
 Through Jesus Christ My Son.
 ||From London down to Cape Town,
 From L.A. to Beijing,
 My Son shall reign the undisputed King!
