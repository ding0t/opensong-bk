[C]
 Oh, it's great, great, brill, brill,
 Wicked, wicked, skill, skill,
 To have a friend like Jesus.
 Great, great, brill, brill,
 Wicked, wicked, skill, skill,
 To have a friend like Him.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 He's always there,
 He always listens,
 He always hears me when I talk to Him.
 He loves me now
 And will forever,
 I'll choose Him every day, day, day.
