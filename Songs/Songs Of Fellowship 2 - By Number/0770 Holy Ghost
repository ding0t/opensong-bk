  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Holy Ghost,
 You wonderful Holy Ghost,
 A wind blowing strong,
 Blowing from heaven.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 We have decided to go
 All the way with our God.
 Revival in the land, that's our goal;
 As soldiers in His army
 We'll fight with heart and soul.
[V3]
 Blood and fire,
 We call upon blood and fire,
 A wind blowing strong,
 Blowing from heaven.
 (Repeat)
