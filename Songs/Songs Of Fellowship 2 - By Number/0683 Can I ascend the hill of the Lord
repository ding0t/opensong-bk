  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Can I ascend the hill of the Lord?
 Can I stand in that holy place?
 There to approach the glory of my God;
 Come towards to seek Your face.
 Purify my heart,
 And purify my hands,
 For I know it is on holy ground I'll stand.
[V2]
 I'm coming up the mountain, Lord;
 I'm seeking You and You alone.
 I know that I will be transformed,
 My heart unveiled before You.
 I'm longing for Your presence, Lord;
 Envelop me within the cloud.
 I'm coming up the mountain, Lord,
 My heart unveiled before You,
 I will come.
[V3]
 I'm coming to worship,
 I'm coming to bow down,
 I'm coming to meet with You.
 (Repeat)
