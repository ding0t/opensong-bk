  <lyrics>
[C]
 And He shall reign forever,
 His throne and crown shall ever endure.
 And He shall reign forever,
 And we shall reign with Him.
[V1]
 What a vision filled my eyes,
 One like a Son of man,
 Coming with the clouds of heaven
 He approached an awesome throne.
[V2]
 He was given sovereign power,
 Glory and authority.
 Every nation, tribe and tongue
 Worshipped Him on bended knee.
[V3]
 On the throne forever,
 See the Lamb who once was slain.
 Wounds of sacrificial love
 Forever shall remain.
