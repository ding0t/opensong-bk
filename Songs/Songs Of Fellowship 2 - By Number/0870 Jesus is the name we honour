  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Jesus is the name we honour;
 Jesus is the name we praise.
 Majestic Name above all other names,
 The highest heaven and earth proclaim
 That Jesus is our God.
[C]
 We will glorify,
 We will lift Him high,
 We will give Him honour and praise.
 We will glorify,
 We will lift Him high,
 We will give Him honour and praise.
[V2]
 Jesus is the name we worship;
 Jesus is the name we trust.
 He is the King above all other kings,
 Let all creation stand and sing
 That Jesus is our God.
[V3]
 Jesus is the Father's splendour;
 Jesus is the Father's joy.
 He will return to reign in majesty,
 And every eye at last shall see
 That Jesus is our God.
