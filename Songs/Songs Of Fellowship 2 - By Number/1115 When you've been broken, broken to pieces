  <lyrics>
[V1]
 When you've been broken, broken to pieces,
 And your heart begins to faint,
 'Cause you don't understand.
 ||And when there is nothing
 To rake from the ashes,
 And you can't even walk
 Onto the fields of praise.
 But I bow down and kiss the Son.
 Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
[V2]
 When the rock falls, falls upon you,
 And you get ground to dust,
 No music for your pain.
 ||You open the windows,
 The windows of heaven,
 And then You opened me,
 And You crushed me like a rose.
 But I bow down and kiss the Son.
 Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
 Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
[V3]
 Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth,
 Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth.
 
 Though You slay me, I will trust You, Lord.
 (Repeat x4)
