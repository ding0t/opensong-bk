  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We are the army of God,
 Sons of Abraham,
 We are a chosen generation.
 Under a covenant,
 Washed by His precious blood,
 Filled with the mighty Holy Ghost.
[V2]
 And I hear the sound of the coming rain,
 As we sing the praise to the great I AM.
 And the sick are healed,
 And the dead shall rise,
 And Your church is the army that was prophesied.
