[V1]
 Show me the way of the cross once again,
 Denying myself for the love that I've gained.
 Everything's You now, everything's changed;
 It's time You had my whole life,
 You can have it all.
[C]
 Yes, I resolve to give it all;
 Some things must die, some things must live,
 Not 'what can I gain', but 'what can I give'.
 If much is required when much is received,
 Then You can have my whole life,
 Jesus, have it all.
[V2]
 I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich,
 And crafted myself a more comfortable cross.
 Yet what I am called to is deeper than this;
 It's time You had my whole life,
 You can have it all.
