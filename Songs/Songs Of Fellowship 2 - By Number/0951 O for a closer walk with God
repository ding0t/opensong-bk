  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O for a closer walk with God,
 A calm and heavenly frame,
 A light to shine upon the road
 That leads me to the Lamb.
[V2]
 Where is the blessedness I knew
 When I first saw the Lord?
 Where is that soul-refreshing view
 Of Jesus and His word?
[V3]
 What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
 How sweet their memory still!
 But they have left an aching void
 The world can never fill.
[V4]
 Return, O holy Dove! return,
 Sweet messenger of rest!
 I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
 And drove Thee from my breast.
[V5]
 The dearest idol I have known,
 Whate'er that idol be,
 Help me tear if from Thy throne,
 And worship only Thee.
[V6]
 So shall my walk be close with God,
 Calm and serene my frame;
 So purer light shall mark the road
 That leads me to the Lamb.
