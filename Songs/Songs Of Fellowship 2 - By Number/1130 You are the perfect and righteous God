[V1]
 You are the perfect and righteous God
 Whose presence bears no sin;
 You bid me come to Your holy place:
 How can I enter in
 When Your presence bears no sin?
 ||Through Him who poured out His life for me,
 The atoning Lamb of God,
 Through Him and His work alone I boldly come.
[C]
 I come by the blood, I come by the cross,
 Where Your mercy flows
 From hands pierced for me.
 For I dare not stand on my righteousness,
 My every hope rests on what Christ has done,
 And I come by the blood.
[V2]
 You are the high and exalted King,
 The One the angels fear;
 So far above me in every way,
 Lord, how can I draw near
 To the One the angels fear?
 ||Through Him who laid down His life for me
 And ascended to Your side,
 Through Him, through Jesus alone I boldly come.
