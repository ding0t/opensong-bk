  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You bless my life, and heal me inside,
 Over and over again.
 You touched my heart and brought peace of mind,
 Over and over again.
[C]
 All I can say is I love You.
 All I can say is I need You.
 All I can say is I thank You, Lord,
 For all that You've done in my life.
[V2]
 You've been so kind and patient with me,
 Over and over again.
 When I have strayed You showed me the way,
 Over and over again.
