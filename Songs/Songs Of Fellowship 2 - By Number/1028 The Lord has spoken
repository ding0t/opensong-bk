[V1]
 The Lord has spoken. (Men/Women echo)
 His purpose stands. (Men/Women echo)
 The Lord has spoken. (Men/Women echo)
 His purpose stands. (Men/Women echo)
[V2]
 Does God speak and then not act?
 Make a vow and not fulfil?
 I will choose to serve the Lord
 Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly.
[C1]
 Oh, raise up a church
 With a different spirit,
 Like Caleb's spirit, believing Your word.
 Oh, raise up a church who will not sin,
 They press on in to possess the land.
[V3]
 You began with just one man,
 A covenant with Abraham,
 Promising that through his seed
 The nations would be blessed,
 And now Your plan is manifest.
[C2]
 Oh, raise up a church who walk by faith,
 In the fear of God they overcome.
 Oh, raise up a church
 Whose God is with them,
 They walk in wisdom, they fear no harm.
[V4]
 Deliver us from the fear of man,
 And by Your grace we shall stand.
 We'll call to mind Your mighty works
 And Your acts of sovereign power;
 We'll gather strength as we agree
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
[C3]
 Oh, raise up a church
 Who revere Your judgements,
 They lift up a banner of mercy and love.
 Oh, raise up a church
 Who'll not keep silent,
 They speak of the glory of Your dear Son.
