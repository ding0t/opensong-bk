[V1]
 How can I be free from sin?
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
 From the guilt, the power, the pain?
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
 ||There's no other way,
 No price that I could pay;
 Simply to the cross I cling.
 This is all I need,
 This is all I plead,
 That His blood was shed for me.
[V2]
 How can I know peace within?
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
 Sing a song of joy again!
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
 ||Flowing from above,
 All-forgiving love
 From the Father's heart to me!
 What a gift of grace -
 His own righteousness
 Clothing me in purity!
[V3]
 How can I live day by day?
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
 Following His narrow way?
 Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
