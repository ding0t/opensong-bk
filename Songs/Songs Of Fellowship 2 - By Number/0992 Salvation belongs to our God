  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Salvation belongs to our God,
 Who sits on the throne,
 And to the Lamb.
 Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
 Honour and power and strength:
[C]
 Be to our God forever and ever,
 Be to our God forever and ever,
 Be to our God forever and ever, amen.
[V2]
 And we, the redeemed shall be strong
 In purpose and unity,
 Declaring aloud,
 Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
 Honour and power and strength:
