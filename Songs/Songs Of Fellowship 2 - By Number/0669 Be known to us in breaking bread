  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Be known to us in breaking bread,
 But do not then depart;
 Saviour, abide with us, and spread
 Thy table in our heart.
[V2]
 There sup with us in love divine;
 Thy body and Thy blood,
 That living bread, that heavenly wine,
 Be our immortal food.
[V3]
 We would not live by bread alone,
 But by Thy word of grace,
 In strength of which we travel on
 To our abiding place.
