[V1]
 I will sing, I will sing a song unto the Lord, (3 times)
 Alleluia, glory to the Lord.
[C]
 Allelu, alleluia, glory to the Lord,
 Allelu, alleluia, glory to the Lord,
 Allelu, alleluia, glory to the Lord,
 Alleluia, glory to the Lord.
[V2]
 We will come, we will come as one before the Lord, (3 times)
 Alleluia, glory to the Lord.
[V3]
 If the Son, if the Son shall make you free, (3 times)
 You shall be free indeed.
[V4]
 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy, (3 times)
 Alleluia, glory to the Lord!
[V5]
 Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess, (3 times)
 That Jesus Christ is Lord.
[V6]
 In His name, in His name we have the victory, (3 times)
 Alleluia, glory to the Lord.
