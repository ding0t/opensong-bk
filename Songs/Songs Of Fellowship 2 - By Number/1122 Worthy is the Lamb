  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb,
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[C]
 My Lord and Saviour,
 My great Redeemer,
 Your blood has purchased me for God.
 My Lord and Saviour,
 My great Redeemer,
 You came to set the captives free.
[V2]
 Holy is the Lamb,
 Holy is the Lamb,
 Holy is the Lamb who was slain.
[V3]
 Jesus, You're the Lamb,
 Jesus, You're the Lamb,
 Jesus, You're the Lamb who was slain
[V4]
 Glory to the Lamb,
 Glory to the Lamb,
 Glory to the Lamb who was slain
