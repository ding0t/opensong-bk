  <lyrics>
[V1]
 As water to the thirsty,
 As beauty to the eyes,
 As strength that follows weakness,
 As truth instead of lies;
 As songtime and springtime
 And summertime to be,
 So is my Lord,
 My living Lord,
 So is my Lord to me.
[V2]
 Like calm in place of clamour,
 Like peace that follows pain,
 Like meeting after parting,
 Like sunshine after rain;
 Like moonlight and starlight
 And sunlight on the sea,
 So is my Lord,
 My living Lord,
 So is my Lord to me.
[V3]
 As sleep that follows fever,
 As gold instead of grey,
 As freedom after bondage,
 As sunrise to the day;
 As home to the traveller
 And all he longs to see,
 So is my Lord,
 My living Lord,
 So is my Lord to me.
