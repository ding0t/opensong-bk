  <lyrics>
[V1]
 May I sing a song of love
 To the One who saved my soul?
 May I bow my head today
 In the presence of the King?
[V2]
 You have called and I will come,
 Lift my hands up to Your throne;
 Worship You on holy ground -
 That's what I long to do.
[V3]
 Draw me near into Your heart.
 All I have is broken love,
 And a thirst that cries for more.
 Draw me near to You.
