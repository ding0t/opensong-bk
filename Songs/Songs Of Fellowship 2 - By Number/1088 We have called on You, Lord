  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We have called on You, Lord,
 And You have heard us.
 We have called on Your name,
 And You have answered.
 Mercy has triumphed over judgement.
 Mercy has triumphed over judgement.
[V2]
 You have stretched out Your hand,
 And You have touched us,
 Sent us Your holy fire,
 And You have purged us.
 Light has triumphed over darkness.
 Light has triumphed over darkness.
[V3]
 We love You, and sing to You,
 God of our salvation.
 You've rescued us and we declare
 Your glory to the nations.
 We give our lives, a living sacrifice,
 Empty and ready to be filled
 With Your power.
