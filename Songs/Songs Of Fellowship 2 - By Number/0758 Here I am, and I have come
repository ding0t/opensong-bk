  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Here I am, and I have come
 To thank You, Lord, for all You've done;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You paid the price at Calvary,
 You shed Your blood, You set me free;
 Thank You, Lord.
 ||No greater love was ever shown,
 No better life ever was laid down.
[C]
 And I will always love Your name;
 And I will always sing Your praise.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 You took my sin, You took my shame,
 You drank my cup, You bore my pain;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You broke the curse, You broke the chains,
 In victory from death You rose again;
 Thank You, Lord.
 ||And not by works, but by Your grace
 You clothe me now in Your righteousness.
[V3]
 You bid me come, You make me whole,
 You give me peace, You restore my soul;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You fill me up, and when I'm full,
 You give me more till I overflow;
 Thank You, Lord.
 ||You're making me to be like You,
 To do the works of the Father, too.
