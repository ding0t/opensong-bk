[V1]
 Behold the servant of the Lord:
 I wait Thy guiding eye to feel,
 To hear and keep Thy every word,
 To prove and do Thy perfect will;
 Joyful from my own works to cease,
 Glad to fulfil all righteousness.
[V2]
 Me if Thy grace vouchsafe to use,
 Meanest of all Thy creatures, me.
 The deed, the time, the manner choose:
 Let all my fruit be found of Thee.
 Let all my works in Thee be wrought,
 By Thee to full perfection brought.
[V3]
 My every weak though good design
 O'errule or change, as seems Thee meet:
 Jesus, let all my work be Thine -
 Thy work, O Lord, is all complete,
 And pleasing in Thy Father's sight;
 Thou only hast done all things right.
[V4]
 Here then to Thee Thine own I leave;
 Mould as Thou wilt Thy passive clay;
 But let me all Thy stamp receive,
 But let me all Thy words obey,
 Serve with a single heart and eye,
 And in Thy glory live and die.
