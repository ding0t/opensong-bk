  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, I long to see You glorified
 In everything I do;
 All my heartfelt dreams I put aside,
 To see Your Spirit move with power in my life.
[V2]
 Jesus, Lord of all eternity,
 Your children rise in faith;
 All the earth displays Your glory,
 And each word You speak
 Brings life to all who hear.
[V3]
 Lord of all,
 All of creation sings Your praise
 In heaven and earth.
 Lord, we stand,
 Hearts open wide,
 Be exalted.
