[V1]
 We're looking to Your promise of old,
 That if we pray and humble ourselves,
 You will come and heal our land,
 You will come,
 You will come.
[V2]
 We're looking to the promise You made,
 That if we turn and look to Your face,
 You will come and heal our land,
 You will come,
 You will come to us.
[C]
 Lord, send revival, start with me.
 For I am one of unclean lips,
 And my eyes have seen the King;
 Your glory I have glimpsed.
 Send revival, start with me.
