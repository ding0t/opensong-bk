  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You have lifted up the humble,
 Filled the hungry with good things;
 Shown Your mercy to the fearful,
 You have healing in Your wings.
 The rich will leave with nothing,
 But the poor will have it all,
 And the pure in heart will see their holy God.
[V2]
 You will light the road from darkness,
 As You lead us to Your throne;
 You give strength to the weary,
 And shelter from the storm.
 You pour out living waters
 So we will never thirst,
 And You wipe away the tears from our eyes.
[C]
 Holy is Your name,
 Holy is Your name;
 Perfect grace and rich in love,
 Your mercy never ends.
 Holy is Your name,
 Holy is Your name;
 Precious Lamb of sacrifice,
 Forever You will reign.
[V3]
 You bring justice to the nations,
 Salvation's at Your hand;
 With your blood You made the purchase
 From every tribe and land,
 To be priests within Your kingdom,
 Your Spirit's on us all
 To show the love and favour of the Lord.
