  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Let the righteous sing,
 Come let the righteous dance,
 Rejoice before your God,
 Be happy and joyful,
 Give Him your praise.
 We give You our praise.
 ||Shout for joy to God
 Who rides upon the clouds,
 How awesome are His deeds,
 So great is His power.
 Give Him your praise.
 We give You our praise.
[V2]
 He gives the desolate a home,
 He leads the prisoners out with singing.
 Father to the fatherless,
 Defender of the widow
 Is God in His holy place.
