  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We have prayed that You would have mercy;
 We believe from heaven You've heard.
 Heal our land, so dry and so thirsty;
 We have strayed so far from You, Lord.
 ||Your cloud appeared on the horizon,
 Small as a man's hand.
 But now You're near,
 Filling our vision,
 Pour out Your Spirit again.
[V2]
 I felt the touch of Your wind on my face:
 I feel the first drops of rain.
[C]
 Let it rain, let it rain.
 I will not be the same.
 Let it rain, rain on me.
 Let it pour down on me,
 Let it rain.
[C2]
 Let it rain, let it rain,
 Let it rain, let it rain on me.
 Let it rain, let it rain,
 Let it rain.
