  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I've got a love song in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
 I've got a love song in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
[C]
 La la la la la la la,
 La la la la la la la,
 La la la la la la la.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 I've got a passion in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
 I've got a passion in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
[V3]
 I've got rejoicing in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
 I've got rejoicing in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
[V4]
 And there is dancing in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
 And there is dancing in my heart,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
[V5]
 I've never known a love like this,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
 I've never known a love like this,
 It is for You, Lord my God.
