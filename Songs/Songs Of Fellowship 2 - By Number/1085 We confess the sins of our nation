  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We confess the sins of our nation,
 And, Lord, we are guilty
 Of a prayerless life.
 We've turned away our hearts from Your laws,
 And have taken for granted Your unchanging grace.
 ||Turn away this curse from our country;
 We say that we've robbed You,
 And our storehouses are bare.
 Open wide the floodgates of heaven,
 Rebuke the devourer so we may not be destroyed.
[V2]
 You said that if we'd humble ourselves
 And begin to pray,
 You would heal our barren land,
 And cleanse us with Your rain.
[V3]
 Don't pass us by,
 Let this be the generation, Lord,
 That lifts up Your name to all the world.
 Save us, O God,
 Save a people for Yourself, O Lord,
 Let the fear of the Lord be a standard.
 ||Save us, O God,
 Cleanse us from our unfaithfulness,
 Let the place where we live
 Be called a house of prayer.
