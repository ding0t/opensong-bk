  <lyrics>
[V1]
 To Him who loves us,
 And has freed us from our sins
 By His blood,
 And has made us to be a kingdom
 And priests to serve His God.
 (Repeat)
 And Father.
[V2]
 (Men-Women echo each line)
 To Him be glory
 And power
 Forever
 And ever.
 To Him be glory
 And power
 Forever,
 Amen. (Together)
