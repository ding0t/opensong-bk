[C]
 Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart,
 Teach me to move in the power of Your Spirit,
 Teach me to walk in the light of Your presence,
 Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.
 ||Teach me to love with Your heart of compassion,
 Teach me to trust in the word of Your promise,
 Teach me to hope in the day of Your coming,
 Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.
[V1]
 You wrote the rhythm of life,
 Created heaven and earth;
 In You is joy without measure.
 So, like a child in Your sight,
 I dance to see Your delight,
 For I was made for Your pleasure,
 Pleasure.
[V2]
 Let all my movements express
 A heart that loves to say 'yes',
 A will that leaps to obey You.
 Let all my energy blaze
 To see the joy in Your face;
 Let my whole being praise You,
 Praise You.
