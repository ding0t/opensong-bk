  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Eternal covenant of God
 Down through time has been declared;
 Drawing the heart of man
 Into redemption's plan,
 ||Mercy and grace revealed,
 By the blood and Spirit sealed.
 All our sins have been forgiven,
 Raised from death to heights of heaven.
[V2]
 And we're living to the praise of His glory,
 Eternally secure in His love;
 The eyes of our hearts have been opened
 To receive the blessing of God.
 (Repeat)
