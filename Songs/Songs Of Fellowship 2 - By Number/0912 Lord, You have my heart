[V1]
 Lord, You have my heart,
 And I will search for Yours;
 Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
 Lord, You have my heart,
 And I will search for Yours;
 Let me be to You a sacrifice.
[V2]
 And I will praise You, Lord. (Men)
 I will praise You, Lord. (Women)
 And I will sing of love come down. (Men)
 I will sing of love come down. (Women)
 And as You show Your face, (Men)
 Show Your face, (Women)
 We'll see Your glory here. (All)
