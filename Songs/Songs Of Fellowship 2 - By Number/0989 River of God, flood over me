  <lyrics>
[C]
 River of God, flood over me,
 And lift my feet up off the ground.
 Carry me out into Your sea,
 And in Your presence I'll be found.
[V1]
 I've felt Your fire and I've felt Your rain;
 And I've heard Your voice whisper myname.
 I've been wading in Your river,
 I've ridden on Your waves;
 I've tasted of Your goodness,
 Still I'm longing to be changed.
[V2]
 There's something inside me that just won't let go;
 Why am I afraid of losing control?
 Oh, I know Your love is for me,
 And You'll never do me harm;
 So melt away my fears,
 And Holy Spirit come!
[B]
 I've had enough of holding back,
 I see Your goodness all around,
 This time I'm opening up my heart,
 So come and fill me now.
[V4]
 Please help me, Lord, to be more like You,
 To do all the things You've called me to do.
 Let me help bring in Your harvest,
 Oh, I want it for Your Son;
 So fill me with Your power,
 Holy Spirit come!
[V5]
 Come like a mighty rushing wind,
 A tidal wave or a monsoon rain,
 Like a stream in the desert,
 Or a warm summer breeze;
 Gentle Dove of heaven,
 Bring me to my knees!
