  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You have become for us wisdom;
 You have become for us righteousness.
 You have become our salvation;
 You have become all our holiness.
[C]
 All that we need is found in You;
 Oh, all that we need is in You.
 All that we need is found in You;
 You are our all in all.
 You have become our all in all.
[V2]
 You have become our provision;
 In union with You we have victory.
 In You we have died and have risen;
 You are our great hope of glory.
