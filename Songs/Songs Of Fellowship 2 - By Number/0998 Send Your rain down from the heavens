  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Send Your rain down from the heavens;
 Send Your rain to this earth.
 Let there be a great outpouring;
 Holy Spirit, come to us.
[V2]
 Send Your fire down from the heavens;
 The fire of revival to Your church.
 We can see the world is waiting;
 Holy Spirit, come to us.
[V3]
 Fill this land with Your grace and mercy;
 Cause our hearts to worship You.
