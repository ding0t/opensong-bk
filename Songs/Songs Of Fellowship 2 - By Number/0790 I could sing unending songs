[C]
 I could sing unending songs
 Of how You saved my soul.
 Well, I could dance a thousand miles
 Because of Your great love.
[V1]
 My heart is bursting, Lord,
 To tell of all You've done,
 Of how You changed my life
 And wiped away the past.
 I wanna shout it out,
 From every rooftop sing,
 For now I know that God is for me,
 Not against me.
[V2]
 Everybody's singing now,
 'Cause we're so happy!
 Everybody's dancing now,
 'Cause we're so happy!
 If only we could see Your face,
 And see You smiling over us,
 And unseen angels celebrate,
 For joy is in this place!
