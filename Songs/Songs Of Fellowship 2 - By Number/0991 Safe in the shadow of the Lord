  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
 Beneath His hand and power,
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 My fortress and my tower.
[V2]
 My hope is set on God alone,
 Though Satan spreads his snare,
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 To keep me in His care.
[V3]
 From fears and phantoms of the night,
 From foes about my way,
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 By darkness as by day.
[V4]
 His holy angels keep my feet
 Secure from every stone;
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 And unafraid go on.
[V5]
 Strong in the everlasting Name,
 And in my Father's care,
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 Who hears and answers prayer.
[V6]
 Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
 Possessed by love divine,
 I trust in Him,
 I trust in Him,
 And meet His love with mine.
