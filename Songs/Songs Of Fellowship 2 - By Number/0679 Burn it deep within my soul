  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Burn it deep within my soul,
 New strength and fire, O Lord.
 Burn it deep within my soul,
 New zeal and fire, O Lord.
 Burn it deep within my soul,
 New strength and fire,
 It makes me whole.
 Burn it deep,
 Deep within my soul.
[V2]
 And You came
 With the Holy Spirit's desire.
 You came
 With a zeal for Your Father's house.
 Consume me, Lord,
 With Your purifying fire,
 And strengthen me
 By Your mighty hand.
