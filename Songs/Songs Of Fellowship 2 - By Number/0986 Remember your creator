[C]
 Remember your creator
 In the days of your youth.
 (Repeat 4 times)
[V1]
 See people old and grey,
 Hear them say:
 'Wish I had been that way
 When I was young.
 I wasn't like you, you see,
 Missed the opportunity,
 And now I am old
 And wish I was told.'
[V2]
 While you are young and strong
 You can sing this song,
 You can serve the Lord
 With all you have.
 And you will have no regrets,
 You have done what's best;
 You have not forgot, to...
