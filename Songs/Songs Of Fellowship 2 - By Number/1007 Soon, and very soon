[V1]
 Soon, and very soon,
 We are going to see the King;
 Soon, and very soon,
 We are going to see the King;
 Soon, and very soon,
 We are going to see the King;
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 We're going to see the King!
[V2]
 No more crying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 No more crying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 No more crying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 We're going to see the King!
[V3]
 No more dying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 No more dying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 No more dying there,
 We are going to see the King;
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 We're going to see the King!
[C]
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 Alleluia, alleluia,
