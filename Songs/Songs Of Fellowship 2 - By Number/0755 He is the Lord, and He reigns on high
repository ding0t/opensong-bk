[V1]
 He is the Lord, and He reigns on high:
 He is the Lord.
 Spoke into the darkness, created the light:
 He is the Lord.
 ||Who is like unto Him, never ending in days?
 He is the Lord.
 And He comes in power when we call on His name:
 He is the Lord.
[C1]
 Show Your power, O Lord our God.
 Show Your power, O Lord our God,
 Our God.
[V2]
 Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation:
 You are the Lord.
 It's the power of God for our salvation:
 You are the Lord.
 ||We ask not for riches, but look to the cross:
 You are the Lord.
 And for our inheritance give us the lost:
 You are the Lord.
[C2]
 Send Your power, O Lord our God.
 Send Your power, O Lord our God,
 Our God.
