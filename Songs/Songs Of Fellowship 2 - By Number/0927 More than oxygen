  <lyrics>
[V1]
 More than oxygen, I need Your love;
 More than life-giving food
 The hungry dream of.
 More than an eloquent word
 Depends on the tongue;
 More than a passionate song
 Needs to be sung.
[C]
 More than a word could ever say,
 More than a song could ever convey;
 I need You more than all of these things.
 Father, I need You more.
[V2]
 More than magnet and steel
 Are drawn to unite;
 More that poets love words
 To rhyme as they write.
 More than comforting warmth
 Of sun in spring;
 More than the eagle loves wind
 Under its wings.
[V3]
 More than a blazing fire
 On a winter's night;
 More than tall evergreens
 Reach for the light.
 More than the pounding waves
 Long for the shore;
 More than these gifts You give,
 I love You more.
