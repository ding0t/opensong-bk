  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I cry out
 For your hand of mercy to heal me.
 I am weak,
 I need Your love to free me.
 O Lord, my Rock,
 My strength in weakness,
 Come rescue me, O Lord.
[V2]
 You are my hope,
 Your promise never fails me.
 And my desire
 Is to follow You forever.
 ||For You are good,
 For You are good,
 For You are good to me.
 For You are good,
 For You are good,
 For You are good to me.
