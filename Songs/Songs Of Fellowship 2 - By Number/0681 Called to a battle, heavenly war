  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Called to a battle, heavenly war;
 Though we may struggle, victory is sure.
 Death will not triumph, though we may die;
 Jesus has promised our eternal life.
[C]
 By the blood of the Lamb we shall overcome,
 See the accuser thrown down.
 By the word of the Lord we shall overcome,
 Raise a victory cry,
 Like thunder in the skies,
 Thunder in the skies.
[V2]
 Standing together, moving as one;
 We are God's army, called to overcome.
 We are commissioned, Jesus says go;
 In every nation, let His love be known.
