  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
 Praise Him all creatures here below.
 Praise Him above, you heavenly host,
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Give glory to the Father,
 Give glory to the Son,
 Give glory to the Spirit
 While endless ages run.
 ||'Worthy the Lamb'
 All heaven cries,
 'To be exalted thus:'
 'Worthy the Lamb'
 Our hearts reply,
 'For He was slain for us.'
[V3]
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow.(x4)
