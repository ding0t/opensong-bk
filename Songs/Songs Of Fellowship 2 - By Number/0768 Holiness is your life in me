  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Holiness is your life in me,
 Making me clean through Your blood.
 Holiness is Your fire in me,
 Purging my heart like a flood.
 I know You are perfect in holiness.
 Your life in me, setting me free,
 Making me holy.
[V2]
 Only the blood of Jesus covers all of my sin.
 Only the life of Jesus renews me from within.
 ||Your blood is enough, Your mercy complete.
 Your work of atonement, paid for my debts,
 Making me holy.
 Only the blood of Jesus.
