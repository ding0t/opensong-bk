[V1]
 Come, my soul, and praise the Lord.  (Men - Women echo)
 Sing to Christ, the living Word,   (Men - Women echo)
 Who heals my broken heart,   (Men - Women echo)
 And binds my wounds. (Men - Women echo)
[V2]
 Holy, holy is the Lord, (Men - Women echo)
 Who may stand before His word?   (Men - Women echo)
 He knows my life so well,   (Men - Women echo)
 Yet loves me still. (Men - Women echo)
[V3]
 As His eye is on the sparrow,
 So His thoughts are for my life.
 Not a moment passes by
 But He thinks of me,
 And He hears me when I cry.
 So come my soul...
