[V1]
 In these days of darkness,
 Who will bear the light?
 In all of this confusion,
 Who will rage against the night?
 And who will light a beacon
 In the face of this dark, dark sky?
[V2]
 Where there is oppression,
 Who will raise the flame?
 For the sake of all the children,
 Who will touch the fields of shame?
 And who will light a beacon
 In the face of this dark, dark sky,
 With a hope that is eternal,
 With a love that will never die?
[C1]
 Oh I, I will carry the fire.
 Oh I, I will carry the fire.
[V3]
 Who will burn with passion,
 Blazing from the heart,
 To forge a new tomorrow?
 We must tell the world
 Of a hope that is eternal,
 Of a love that will never die.
 And we will light a beacon
 In the face of this dark, dark sky.
[C2]
 Oh I, I will carry the fire.
 Oh I, I will carry the fire.
 I will not rest, I will not tire,
 With all my strength I'll carry the fire.
 I will not rest, I will not tire,
 With all my strength I'll carry the fire.
