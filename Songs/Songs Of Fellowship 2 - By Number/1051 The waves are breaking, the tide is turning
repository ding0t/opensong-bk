[V1]
 The waves are breaking, the tide is turning,
 God's Spirit is coming to this earth;
 The harvest is waiting,
 And we have been called
 To go to the nations of this world.
[C]
 To the ends of the earth,
 To the ends of the earth,
 To the ends of the earth we will go;
 Bearing the message
 That our God can be known,
 To the ends of the earth we will go.
[V2]
 The fire is falling, the wind is blowing,
 The flame is spreading across our land;
 Revival is coming, let the world hear,
 Tell every woman, child and man.
[V3]
 The drums are beating,
 The trumpet is sounding,
 A warrior spirit He's put in our hearts;
 In the name of the Father, Spirit and Son,
 We'll take this word to everyone.
