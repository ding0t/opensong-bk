  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will dance, I will sing,
 To be mad for my King.
 Nothing, Lord, is hindering
 The passion in my soul.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 And I'll become
 Even more undignified than this.
 (Some would say it's foolishness but)
 I'll become
 Even more undignified than this.
[V3]
 Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
 Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
