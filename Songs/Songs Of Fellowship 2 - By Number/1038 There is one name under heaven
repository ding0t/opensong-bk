  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There is one name under heaven
 By which men can be saved,
 Jesus alone.
 Only one name under heaven,
 Jesus, and Jesus alone.
[V2]
 One sacrifice,
 One holy Lamb
 Shed His own blood,
 Paid for my sin;
 And this righteous One,
 God's only Son,
 I sing my praises to Him,
 I sing my praises to Him.
