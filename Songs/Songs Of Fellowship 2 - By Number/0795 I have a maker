  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I have a maker,
 He formed my heart;
 Before even time began
 My life was in His hand.
[V2]
 I have a Father,
 He calls me His own;
 He'll never leave me,
 No matter where I go.
[V3]
 He knows my name,
 He knows my every thought;
 He sees each tear that falls,
 And hears me when I call.
