[C]
 Lord of the dance,
 You're the dancing Lord.
 (Repeat x4)
 Everybody dance, yeah!
[V1]
 Well everybody dance, now,
 Get in the Holy Ghost.
 Everybody praise the One, love the One,
 You want the One, yeah,
 The One you want the most, now.
 ||Can't nobody stop me now,
 I'm gonna give it everything I've got.
 I come to You, run to You,
 Run to You, yeah,
 Just like a child.
[V2]
 It's just this love I have inside,
 Yeah, I want it.
 I feel You pleasure in my heart,
 Yeah, I need it.
 I want Your love
 More and more each day.
 And when I dance before You, Lord,
 I'm gonna dance with all my might.
