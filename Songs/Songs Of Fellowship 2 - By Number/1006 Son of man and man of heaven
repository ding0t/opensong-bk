  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Son of man and man of heaven,
 Full of grace and truth;
 Sinner's friend yet without sin,
 I want to be like You:
 Perfect in holiness,
 Full of faithfulness and love.
[C1]
 I want to be like Jesus,
 I want to be like Jesus,
 I want to be like You, 
 O Lord, our God.
 I want to be like Jesus,
 I want to be like Jesus,
 I want to be like You, 
 O Lord, our God.
[V2]
 You began a work in me,
 I know You'll see it through.
 There's a new song in my heart,
 And I want to sing to You.
 You lifted me from mire,
 From sin and from shame You set me free,
 And I know Your tenderness,
 I know Your power at work in me.
[C2]
 You're making me like Jesus,
 You're making me like Jesus,
 You're making me like You, 
 O Lord, our God.
 You're making me like Jesus,
 You're making me like Jesus,
 You're making me like You, 
 O Lord, our God.
