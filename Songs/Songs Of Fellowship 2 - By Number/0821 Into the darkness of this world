  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Into the darkness of this world,
 Into the shadows of the night;
 Into this loveless place You came,
 Lightened our burdens, eased our pain,
 And made these hearts Your home.
 Into the darkness once again -
 Oh come, Lord Jesus, come.
[C1]
 Come with Your love
 To make us whole,
 Come with Your light
 To lead us on,
 Driving the darkness
 Far from our souls:
 O come, Lord Jesus, come.
[V2]
 Into the longing of our souls,
 Into these heavy hearts of stone,
 Shine on us now Your piercing light,
 Order our lives and souls aright,
 By grace and love unknown,
 Until in You our hearts unite -
 Oh come, Lord Jesus, come.
[V3]
 O Holy Child, Emmanuel,
 Hope of the ages, God with us,
 Visit again this broken place,
 Till all the earth declares Your praise
 And Your great mercies own.
 Now let Your love be born in us,
 O come, Lord Jesus, come.
[C2]
 Come in Your glory,
 Take Your place,
 Jesus, the Name above all names,
 We long to see You face to face,
 O come, Lord Jesus, come.
