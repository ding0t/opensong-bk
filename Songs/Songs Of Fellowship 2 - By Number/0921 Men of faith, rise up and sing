[V1]
 Men of faith, rise up and sing
 Of the great and glorious King;
 You are strong when you feel weak,
 In your brokenness complete.
[C1]
 Shout to the north and the south,
 Sing to the east and the west:
 Jesus is Saviour to all,
 Lord of heaven and earth.
[V2]
 Rise up women of the truth,
 Stand and sing to broken hearts,
 Who can know the healing power
 Of our glorious King of love.
[V3]
 We've been through fire,
 We've been through rain;
 We've been refined
 By the power of His name.
 We've fallen deeper in love with You,
 You've burned the truth on our lips.
[V4]
 Rise up church with broken wings;
 Fill this place with songs again,
 Of our God who reigns on high:
 By His grace again we'll fly. 
[C2]
 Shout to the north and the south,
 Sing to the east and the west:
 Jesus is Saviour to all,
 Lord of heaven and earth.
 Lord of heaven and earth,
 Lord of heaven and earth,
 Lord of heaven and earth.
