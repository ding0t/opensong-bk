  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I love the Lord for He has heard me,
 He has heard my mercy plea.
 From deep within my troubled heart,
 I cried 'O Lord, save me!'
 I love the Lord for His compassion
 And His gracious, righteous ways.
 He protects the simple-hearted ones,
 And in my need,
 The Lord saw me, and saved.
[C]
 For as long, for as long as I live,
 I will call, I will call on His name.
 Be at rest once more, my soul,
 For the Lord is good,
 And He has been good to you.
[V2]
 I love the Lord for all the goodness
 That I never can repay,
 But I lift the cup of salvation,
 And call upon His name.
 I will fulfil my vows before the Lord,
 In the presence of His saints;
 O, make me now Your servant, Lord,
 You have freed me from,
 You have freed me from these chains.
