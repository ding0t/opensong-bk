  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We behold Your glory,
 Fountain of life, the Lord Jesus Christ.
 Lord of the universe,
 You die in weakness;
 Strong Deliverer,
 How You were wounded.
 ||Sustainer of life,
 Disfigured and shamed,
 This is the medicine
 That saves and heals us.
 A crown of thorns
 Was placed on Your brow;
 Though You were scourged,
 Blow after blow,
 By Your stripes we are healed.
[V2]
 We behold Your glory,
 Fountain of life, the Lord Jesus Christ.
 Though You were fettered,
 We are delivered;
 Though You were condemned,
 We are absolved.
 ||Though You were exposed
 To mocking and shame,
 We are established
 And raised up in honour.
 Though You were laid
 In the dust of death,
 Though You went down
 To hell's darkest depths,
 The kingdom of heaven is ours.
