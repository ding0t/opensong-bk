[V1]
 I am the APPLE of God's eye,
 His BANANA over me is love.
 He ORANGES His angels to look after me,
 As His blessings PLUM-met from above.
[V2]
 Never have to play the GOOSEBERRY,
 Feel like a LEMON, no not me.
 For wherever this MAN-GOES,
 A RASPBERRY it never blows.
[C]
 The GREAT FRUIT of God,
 The GREAT FRUIT of God,
 The GREAT FRUIT of God it overflows.
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 I will praise Him on the TANGERINE,
 Praise Him on the MANDARIN;
 SATSUMA or later you will see
 There is always a CLEMENTINEfor praising Him.
