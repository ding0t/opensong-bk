[V1]
 I don't want to be a Pharisee
 Or anyone like that.
 It's stupid swallowing camels
 Whilst straining out a gnat.
 To keep the letter of the law,
 They forgot the people it was for.
[V2]
 So I don't want to be a Pharisee,
 I don't want to be a Pharisee,
 I don't want to be a Pharisee
 Or anyone like that.
