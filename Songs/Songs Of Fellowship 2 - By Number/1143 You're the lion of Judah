  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You're the Lion of Judah,
 The Lamb that was slain,
 You ascended to heaven
 And ever more will reign;
 At the end of the age
 When the earth You reclaim,
 You will gather the nations before You.
 ||And the eyes of all men will be
 Fixed on the Lamb who was crucified,
 For with wisdom and mercy and justice
 You'll reign at Your Father's side.
[C]
 And the angels will cry:
 'Hail the Lamb
 Who was slain for the world,
 Rule in power.'
 And the earth will reply:
 'You shall reign
 As the King of all kings
 And the Lord of all Lords.'
[V2]
 There's a shield in our hand
 And a sword at our side,
 There's a fire in our spirit
 That cannot be denied;
 As the Father has told us,
 For these You have died,
 For the nations that gather before You.
 ||And the ears of all men need to hear
 Of the Lamb who was crucified,
 Who descended to hell yet was raised up
 To reign at the Father's side.
