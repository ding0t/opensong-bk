[V1]
 O God of burning, cleansing flame:
 Send the fire!
 Your blood-bought gift today we claim:
 Send the fire today!
 ||Look down and see this waiting host,
 And send the promised Holy Ghost;
 We need another Pentecost!
 Send the fire today!
 Send the fire today!
[V2]
 God of Elijah, hear our cry:
 Send the fire!
 And make us fit to live or die:
 Send the fire today!
 ||To burn up every trace of sin,
 To bring the light and glory in,
 The revolution now begin!
 Send the fire today!
 Send the fire today!
[V3]
 It's fire we want, for fire we plead:
 Send the fire!
 The fire will meet our every need:
 Send the fire today!
 ||For strength to always do what's right,
 For grace to conquer in the fight,
 For power to walk the world in white:
 Send the fire today!
 Send the fire today!
[V4]
 To make our weak hearts strong and brave:
 Send the fire!
 To live, a dying world to save:
 Send the fire today!
 ||Oh, see us on Your altar lay,
 We give our lives to you today,
 So crown the offering now we pray:
 Send the fire today!
 Send the fire today!
 Send the fire today!
