[C]
 Let everything that,
 Everything that,
 Everything that has breath
 Praise the Lord.
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 Praise You in the morning,
 Praise You in the evening,
 Praise You when I'm young
 And when I'm old.
 Praise You when I'm laughing,
 Praise You when I'm grieving,
 Praise You every season of the soul.
[V2]
 If we could see how much You're worth,
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love,
 Then surely we would never cease to praise :
[V3]
 Praise You in the heavens,
 Joining with the angels,
 Praising You forever and a day.
 Praise You on the earth now,
 Joining with creation,
 Calling all the nations to Your praise.
[V4]
 If they could see how much You're worth,
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love,
 Then surely they would never cease to praise:
