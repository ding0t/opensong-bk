[V1]
 Hope of the world,
 You stepped into our time,
 And yet they spurned You and then turned away.
 To a dying world You reached out,
 But they didn't want to hear
 The words You had to say.
[C1]
 But may the light
 You came to bring now shine
 In a world that finally lost its way.
 Holy love, now come,
 Come flow though me,
 Be my theme until my dying day.
[V2]
 Mercy, love, truth,
 You shared all these
 And then to bring them life
 Became a dying seed.
 Now to all who will receive
 A new way has been opened,
 And Your children are the light they need.
[C2]
 And may the light
 You came to bring now shine
 In a world that finally lost its way.
 Holy love, now come,
 Come flow though me,
 Be my theme until my dying day.
