  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, we cry to You, God, break through!
 Let Your presence come in revival.
 Like the gentle dew, our lives renew;
 Let Your presence come in revival.
[C]
 (Men) O God, break through!
 (Women) Send Your Spirit, Lord.
 (Men) O God, break through!
 (Women) Send Your Spirit.
 (All) Let the name of Jesus be proclaimed.
 (Repeat)
 (All) O God, break through.
[V2]
 Lord, we cry to You: God break through!
 Move upon Your church in revival.
 Like a mighty wind and tongues of fire,
 Let Your Spirit come in revival.
[V3]
 Lord, we cry to You: God, break through!
 Sweep across this land in revival.
 Like the mighty rain, flood this land again;
 Let Your power come in revival.
