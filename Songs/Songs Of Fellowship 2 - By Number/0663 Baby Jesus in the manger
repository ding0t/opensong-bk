[V1]
 Baby Jesus in the manger,
 To the world He's still a stranger.
 Wise men bring their gifts
 Of gold and myrrh,
 Baby Jesus in the manger.
[C]
 Noel, Noel, Noel,
 Hail the Immanuel.
[V2]
 Gentle Jesus, meek and lowly,
 Full of love so pure and holy.
 He will teach and pray,
 Show mankind the way,
 Gentle Jesus, meek and lowly.
[V3]
 Loving Jesus, mocked and beaten,
 He the sin of man has taken.
 He has paid the price,
 He has given His life,
 Loving Jesus, mocked and beaten.
[V4]
 Mighty Jesus, He is risen,
 He has broken out of prison.
 He has conquered sin,
 Brought new life to men,
 Mighty Jesus, He is risen.
