  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Holy is Your name,
 Yeshua, my Deliverer.
 Worthy of all praise,
 You everliving God.
[V2]
 Perfect are Your ways,
 Jehovah, my Father.
 Faithful is Your love,
 You gave Yourself for me.
[V3]
 In You I have security;
 In You I put my trust.
 In You I have confidence,
 You meet my every need.
