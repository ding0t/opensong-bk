[V1]
 I have made You too small in my eyes;
 O Lord, forgive me.
 And I have believed in a lie
 That You were unable to heal me.
 ||But now, O Lord, I see my wrong;
 Heal my heart, and show Yourself strong.
 And in my eyes and with my song,
 O Lord, be magnified,
 O Lord, be magnified.
[C]
 Be magnified, O Lord;
 You are highly exalted.
 And there is nothing You can't do,
 O Lord, my eyes are on You,
 Be magnified,
 O Lord, be magnified.
[V2]
 I have leaned on the wisdom of men;
 O God, forgive me.
 And I have responded to them
 Instead of Your light and Your mercy.
 ||But now, O Lord, I see my wrong;
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong.
 And in my eyes and with my song,
 O Lord, be magnified,
 O Lord, be magnified.
