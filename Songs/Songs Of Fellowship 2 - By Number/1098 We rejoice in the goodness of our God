  <lyrics>
[C]
 We rejoice in the goodness of our God,
 We rejoice in the wonders of Your favour.
 You've set the captives free,
 You've caused the blind to see,
 Hallelujah,
 You give us liberty, hallelujah.
[V1]
 Always the same, You never change,
 And Your mercies are new every day.
 Compassionate and gracious,
 Our faithful loving God,
 Slow to anger, rich in love.
[V2]
 You give us hope, You give us joy,
 You give us fulness of life to enjoy.
 Our Shepherd and Provider,
 Our God who's always there,
 Never failing, always true.
