  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Our Father in heaven,
 Hallowed be Your name,
 Your kingdom come,
 Your will be done on earth as in heaven.
 ||Give us today our daily bread,
 And forgive us our sins
 As we forgive those who sin against us,
 And lead us not into temptation,
 But deliver us from evil;
[V2]
 For the kingdom, the power,
 And the glory are Yours,
 Now and forever, Amen.
[V3]
 For the kingdom, the power
 And the glory are Yours,
 Now and forever,
 Now and forever,
 Now and forever, Amen.
