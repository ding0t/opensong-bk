[V1]
 No other name but the name of Jesus,
 No other name but the name of the Lord;
 No other name but the name of Jesus
 Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honour,
 And worthy of power and all praise.
[V2]
 His name is exalted far above the earth,
 His name is high above the heavens;
 His name is exalted far above the earth,
 Give glory and honour and praise unto His name.
