[V1]
 There is no other friend,
 There is no other friend like You, O Lord;
 No other brother, no other sister like You.
 ||There is no other love,
 There is no other love like You, O Lord;
 No other sweeter, no other fountain but You.
[V2]
 How long until I'm satisfied?
 I must have more of You.
 For I was born in Zion,
 Awakened love is crying out for You.
 Lord, it must be You!
[V3]
 If I am healed by just one touch of Your garment, Lord,
 Then how much more of Your love is for me
 Than I'm tasting, Lord?
 Draw me, take me, I will run
 Over the mountains and down
 Into the valley, I will run with You.
[V4]
 Ah, all my fountains are in You.
 Ah, all my fountains are in You.
