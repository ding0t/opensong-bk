[V1]
 He made the earth, He made the sky,
 He made the moon and the stars,
 Jupiter and Mars.
 He made the sun for everyone,
 Our God made them all.
 ||Our God is powerful, powerful,
 Our God is great.
 Our God is powerful, powerful,
 Our God is great.
[V2]
 He made the fish, He made the birds,
 Elephants and worms,
 Creeping things that squirm.
 Mice so small, giraffes so tall;
 Our God made them all.
 ||Our God is wonderful, wonderful,
 Our God is great.
 Our God is wonderful, wonderful,
 Our God is great.
[V3]
 He made the boys, he made the girls,
 He made our mums and dads,
 To teach us good from bad.
 He cares for me, He cares for You;
 Our God loves us all.
 ||Our God is beautiful, beautiful,
 Our God is great.
 Our God is beautiful, beautiful,
 Our God is great.
