[C]
 Hold me closer to you each day;
 May my love for You never fade.
 Keep my focus on all that's true;
 May I never lose sight of You.
[V1]
 In my failure, in my success,
 If in sadness or happiness,
 Be the hope I am clinging to,
 For my heart belongs to You.
[V2]
 You are only a breath away,
 Watching over me every day;
 In my heart I am filled with peace
 When I hear You speak to me.
[V3]
 No one loves me the way You do,
 No one cares for me like You do.
 Feels like heaven has broken through;
 God, You know how I love You.
