[V1]
 Whose lips will plead
 For the people of this land?
 Who'll stand in the gap,
 And who'll build up the wall,
 Before the long day of God's patience is over,
 Before the night comes
 When His judgement will fall?
[V2]
 And whose eyes will weep
 For the people of this land?
 And whose hearts will break
 For the hearts made of stone,
 For those who are walking out intodarkness,
 Away from God's love,
 Without Christ, so alone?
[V3]
 And whose ears can hear
 What the Spirit is saying
 To those who are willing
 To watch and to pray?
 Pray on till God's light
 Fills the skies over this land,
 The light of revival that brings a new day.
