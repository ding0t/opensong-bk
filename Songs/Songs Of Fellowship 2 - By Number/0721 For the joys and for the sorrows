  <lyrics>
[V1]
 For the joys and for the sorrows,
 The best and worst of times,
 For this moment, for tomorrow,
 For all that lies behind;
 Fears that crowd around me,
 For the failure of my plans,
 For the dreams of all I hope to be,
 The truth of what I am:
[C]
 For this I have Jesus,
 For this I have Jesus,
 For this I have Jesus,
 I have Jesus.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 For the tears that flow in secret,
 In the broken times,
 For the moments of elation,
 Or the troubled mind;
 For all the disappointments,
 Or the sting of old regrets,
 All my prayers and longings
 That seem unanswered yet:
[V3]
 For the weakness of my body,
 The burdens of each day,
 For the nights of doubt and worry,
 When sleep has fled away;
 Needing reassurance,
 And the will to start again,
 A steely-eyed endurance,
 The strength to fight and win:
