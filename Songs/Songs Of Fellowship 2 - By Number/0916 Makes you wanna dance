  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Makes you wanna dance, (echo)
 Makes you wanna sing, (echo)
 Makes you wanna shout all about it,
 Shout all about it,
 Shout it that Jesus is King.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Every nation, power and tongue
 Will bow down to Your name;
 Every eye will see,
 Every ear will hear Your name proclaimed,
 This is gonna be our cry
 Until You come again:
 'Jesus is the only name
 By which man can be saved.'
[C1]
 All over the world people just like us
 Are calling Your name, living in Your love.
 All over the world people just like us
 Are following Jesus.
 (Repeat)
[C2]
 We're worshipping Jesus,
 We're following Jesus,
 We're worshipping Jesus,
 We're calling on Jesus.
