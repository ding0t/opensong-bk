  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will praise You with the harp
 For Your faithfulness, O my God.
 I will sing my praise to You
 With the lyre, with the lyre.
[C]
 O Holy One of Israel, (x3)
 My lips will shout for joy,
 My lips will shout for joy.
 When I sing my praise to You, (x3)
 For I have been redeemed,
 I have been redeemed!
 ||I'll speak of all Your righteous acts, (x3)
 And tell them all day long,
 And tell them all day long.
[V2]
 Those who want to harm me
 Are put to shame and confused.
 I will sing my praise to You
 With the lyre, with the lyre.
[V3]
 I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed!
 I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed!
