  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We will tear down every stronghold
 Through the power of His word.
 We will seek to bring His kingdom in,
 Make a way for His return.
[V2]
 We will tell of His salvation,
 For the church of Christ is called
 To bring healing to the nations,
 See His righteousness restored.
[V3]
 Satan is defeated,
 Christ has overcome,
 Seated at the Father's hand,
 Lord, on earth may Your will now be done.
