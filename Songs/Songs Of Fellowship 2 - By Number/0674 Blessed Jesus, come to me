  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Blessed Jesus, come to me,
 Soothe my soul with songs of peace.
 As I look to You alone,
 Fill me with Your love.
[C]
 Glorious, marvellous
 Grace that rescued me;
 Holy, worthy
 Is the Lamb who died for me.
[V2]
 Mountains high and valleys low,
 You will never let me go;
 By Your fountain let me drink,
 Fill my thirsty soul.
