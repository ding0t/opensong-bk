  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Days of heaven here on the earth;
 Touched by power, touched by love.
 By Your word, and by Your Spirit
 You send Your blessing here on us.
[C]
 Lord, send the rain,
 Let Your Spirit come and glorify Jesus.
 Lord, send the rain,
 Let Your Spirit come like a pent up flood,
 Driven by the breath of God.
[V2]
 We bring our worship, we see Your face;
 We stand in wonder of Your grace.
 Your kingdom presence, Your majesty;
 Jesus, You're here now, hear our plea.
