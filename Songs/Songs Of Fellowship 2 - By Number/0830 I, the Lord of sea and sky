  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I, the Lord of sea and sky,
 I have heard My people cry;
 All who dwell in dark and sin
 My hand will save.
 I, who made the stars of night,
 I will make their darkness bright.
 I will speak My word to them.
 Whom shall I send?
[C]
 Here I am, Lord.
 Is it I, Lord?
 I have heard You calling in the night.
 I will go, Lord,
 If You lead me;
 I will hold Your people in my heart.
[V2]
 I, the Lord of snow and rain,
 I have borne my people's pain;
 I have wept for love of them -
 They turn away.
 I will break their hearts of stone,
 Give them hearts for love alone;
 I will speak My word to them.
 Whom shall I send?
[V3]
 I, the Lord of wind and flame,
 I will tend the poor and lame,
 I will set a feast for them -
 My hand will save.
 Finest bread I will provide
 Till their hearts are satisfied;
 I will give My life to them.
 Whom shall I send?
