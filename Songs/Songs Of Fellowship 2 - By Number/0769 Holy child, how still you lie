  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Holy child, how still you lie!
 Safe the manger, soft the hay;
 Faint upon the eastern sky
 Breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
[V2]
 Holy Child, whose birthday brings
 Shepherds from their field and fold,
 Angel choirs and eastern kings,
 Myrrh and frankincense and gold:
[V3]
 Holy Child, what gift of grace
 From the Father freely willed!
 In Your infant form we trace
 All God's promises fulfilled.
[V4]
 Holy Child, whose human years
 Span like ours delight and pain;
 One in human joys and tears,
 One in all but sin and stain:
[V5]
 Holy Child, so far from home,
 All the lost to seek and save:
 To what dreadful death You come,
 To what dark and silent grave!
[V6]
 Holy Child, before whose name
 Powers of darkness faint and fall;
 Conquered death and sin and shame -
 Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
[V7]
 Holy Child, how still You lie!
 Safe the manger, soft the hay;
 Clear upon the eastern sky
 Breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
