  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Almighty God, my redeemer,
 My hiding place, my safe refuge;
 No other name like Jesus,
 No power can stand against You.
[V2]
 My feet are planted on this rock,
 And I will not be shaken;
 My hope it comes from You alone,
 My Lord and my salvation.
[C]
 Your praise is always on my lips,
 Your word is living in my heart,
 And I will praise You with a new song:
 My soul will bless You, Lord.
 You fill my life with greater joy;
 Yes, I delight myself in You,
 And I will praise You with a new song:
 My soul will bless You, Lord.
[V3]
 When I am weak, You make me strong;
 When I'm poor, I know I'm rich,
 For in the power of Your name
 All things are possible. (x4)
