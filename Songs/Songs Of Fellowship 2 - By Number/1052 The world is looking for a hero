  <lyrics>
[V1]
 The world is looking for a hero;
 We know the greatest One of all:
 The mighty Ruler of the nations,
 King of kings and Lord of Lords;
 Who took the nature of a servant,
 And gave His life to save us all.
[C]
 We will raise a shout,
 We will shout it out,
 He is the Champion of the world.
 We will raise a shout,
 We will shout it out,
 He is the Champion of the world.
[V2]
 The Lord Almighty is our hero,
 He breaks the stranglehold of sin.
 Through Jesus' love we fear no evil;
 Powers of darkness flee from Him.
 His light will shine in every nation,
 A sword of justice He will bring.
