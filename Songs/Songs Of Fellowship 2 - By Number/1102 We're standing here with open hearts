[V1]
 We're standing here with open hearts,
 Our voices joined in unity.
 We know we don't lead perfect lives,
 And we cry to You for mercy.
 ||Father in heaven, we honour Your name,
 That we might bring You glory and fame;
 Pour out Your Spirit upon us we pray,
 To heal and deliver and save.
[C]
 This is our heart cry;
 This is our heart cry.
 This is our heart cry;
 This is our heart cry.
[V2]
 We stand before the throne of grace,
 A people for Your possession;
 We hunger and thirst, we seek Your face,
 Come touch us with Your presence.
 ||Father in heaven, holy and true,
 Stretch out Your hand, let power break through;
 Pour out Your Spirit upon us today,
 To heal and deliver and save.
