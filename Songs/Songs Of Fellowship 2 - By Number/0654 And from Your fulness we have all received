[C]
 And from Your fulness we have all received
 Grace upon grace,
 Kindness on kindness.
 And from Your fulness we have all received
 Grace upon grace,
 Like wave upon wave
 From the ocean of Your love.
[V1]
 Lord, You stand willing
 And ready to bless,
 You bid us bring You
 Great requests;
 Though many are saying
 'Who will show us good?'
 Day after day we see Your mercies.
[V2]
 Lord, You're the Author
 Of every good gift;
 You give us all
 We need to live.
 Lord, You became poor
 To make us rich,
 You crown our lives with Your compassion.
