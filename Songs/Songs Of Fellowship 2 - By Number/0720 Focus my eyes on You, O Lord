  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Focus my eyes on You, O Lord,
 Focus my eyes on You;
 To worship in spirit and in truth,
 Focus my eyes on You.
[V2]
 Turn round my life to You, O Lord,
 Turn round my life to You;
 To know from this night You've made me new,
 Turn round my life to You.
[V3]
 Fill up my heart with praise, O Lord,
 Fill up my heart with praise;
 To speak of Your love in every place,
 Fill up my heart with praise.
