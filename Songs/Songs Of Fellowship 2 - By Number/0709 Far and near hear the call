  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Far and near hear the call,
 Worship Him, Lord of all;
 Families of nations come,
 Celebrate what God has done.
[V2]
 Deep and wide is the love
 Heaven sent from above;
 God's own Son for sinners died,
 Rose again, He is alive.
[C]
 Say it loud, say it strong,
 Tell the world what God has done;
 Say it loud, praise His name,
 Let the earth rejoice
 For the Lord reigns.
[V3]
 At His name let praise begin,
 Oceans roar, nature sing.
 For He comes to judge the earth
 In righteousness and in His truth.
