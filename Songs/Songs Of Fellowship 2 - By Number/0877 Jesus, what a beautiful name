  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
 Son of God, Son of Man,
 Lamb that was slain.
 Joy and peace, strength and hope,
 Grace that blows all fear away.
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[V2]
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
 Truth revealed, my future sealed,
 Healed my pain.
 Love and freedom, life and warmth,
 Grace that blows all fear away.
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[V3]
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
 Rescued my soul, my stronghold,
 Lifts me from shame.
 Forgiveness, security, power and love,
 Grace that blows all fear away.
 Jesus, what a beautiful name.
