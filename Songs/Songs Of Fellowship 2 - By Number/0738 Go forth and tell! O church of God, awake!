[V1]
 Go forth and tell! O church of God, awake!
 God's saving news to all the nations take:
 Proclaim Christ Jesus, Saviour, Lord and King,
 That all the world His worthy praise may sing.
[V2]
 Go forth and tell! God's love embraces all;
 He will in grace respond to all who call:
 How shall they call if they have never heard
 The gracious invitation of His word?
[V3]
 Go forth and tell where still the darkness lies,
 In wealth or want, the sinner surely dies;
 Give us, O Lord, concern of heart and mind,
 A love like Yours, compassionate and kind.
[V4]
 Go forth and tell! The doors are open wide:
 Share God's good gifts - let no one be denied;
 Live out your life as Christ your Lord shall choose,
 Your ransomed powers for His sole glory use.
[V5]
 Go forth and tell! O church of God, arise!
 Go in the strength which Christ your Lord supplies;
 God till all nations His great name adore
 And serve Him, Lord and King forever more.
