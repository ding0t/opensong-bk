[V1]
 God is so good,
 God is so good,
 God is so good,
 He's so good to me.
[V2]
 He took my sin,
 He took my sin,
 He took my sin,
 He's so good to me.
[V3]
 Now I am free,
 Now I am free,
 Now I am free,
 He's so good to me.
[V4]
 God is so good,
 He took my sin,
 Now I am free,
 He's so good to me.
