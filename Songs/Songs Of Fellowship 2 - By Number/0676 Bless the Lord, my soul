[C]
 Bless the Lord, my soul,
 And bless His holy name.
 Bless the Lord, my soul,
 He rescues me from death.
[V1]
 It is He who forgives all your guilt,
 Who heals every one of your ills,
 Who redeems your life from the grave,
 Who crowns you with love and compassion.
[V2]
 The Lord is compassion and love,
 Slow to anger and rich in mercy.
 He does not treat us according to our sins,
 Nor repay us according to our faults.
[V3]
 As a father has compassion on his children,
 The Lord has pity on those who fear Him;
 For He knows of what we are made,
 He remembers that we are dust.
