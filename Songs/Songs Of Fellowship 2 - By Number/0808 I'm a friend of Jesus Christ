[V1]
 I'm a friend of Jesus Christ, (echo)
 He's God's Son and He's alive, (echo)
 I will trust in Him it's true, (echo)
 He's always there to see me through.(echo)
[V2]
 Sound off, Jesus!
 Sound off, is Lord!
 Sound off, Jesus!
 Sound off, is Lord!
[V3]
 The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ,
 (Repeat x3)
 Through Jesus, Jesus Christ.
[V4]
 Jesus is the Boss of my life,
 He's the only one can make it come right.
 Jesus is the Boss of my life,
 Jesus is the Boss.
[V5]
 I said, come on everybody and move your feet;
 The rhythm is hot, it's a powerful beat.
 The time is right to do some business,
 Get on your feet and be a witness
 To the Holy One,
 ||The King of kings, God's only Son;
 Jesus Christ, that's His name,
 He died to take our sin and shame.
