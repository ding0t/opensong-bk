  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Blessing and honour, glory and power
 Be unto the Ancient of Days;
 From every nation, all of creation
 Bow before the Ancient of Days.
[C]
 Every tongue in heaven and earth
 Shall declare Your glory,
 Every knee shall bow at Your throne
 In worship;
 You will be exalted, O God,
 And Your kingdom shall not pass away,
 O Ancient of Days.
[V2]
 Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth:
 Sing unto the Ancient of Days.
 For none shall compare to Your matchless worth:
 Sing unto the Ancient of Days.
