[V1]
 Name of all majesty,
 Fathomless mystery,
 King of the ages
 By angels adored;
 Power and authority,
 Splendour and dignity,
 Bow to His mastery -
 Jesus is Lord!
[V2]
 Child of our destiny,
 God from eternity,
 Love of the Father
 On sinners outpoured;
 See now what God has done,
 Sending His only Son,
 Christ the beloved One -
 Jesus is Lord!
[V3]
 Saviour of Calvary,
 Costliest victory,
 Darkness defeated
 And Eden restored;
 Born as a man to die,
 Nailed to a cross on high,
 Cold in the grave to lie -
 Jesus is Lord!
[V4]
 Source of all sovereignty,
 Light, immortality,
 Life everlasting
 And heaven assured;
 So with the ransomed, we
 Praise Him eternally,
 Christ in His majesty -
 Jesus is Lord!
