[V1]
 There is a home that wanderers seek,
 There is a strength that lifts the weak;
 There is hope for those that know despair.
 There is a cup that satisfies,
 There is a Friend who dries my eyes;
 There is peace for those with heavy hearts.
[C]
 Tender mercy,
 The tender mercy of our God,
 From lips of sinners
 He has heard the faintest cry.
 Tender mercy,
 The tender mercy of our God,
 He has relented and His grace is my delight.
[V2]
 I have resolved to know Him more,
 He whom the hosts of heaven adore,
 Mighty King, whose reign will never end.
 Yet as I gaze at the Holy One,
 He beckons me to closer come,
 Bares the scars that show to me my worth.
