[V1]
 I will wave my hands in praise and adoration,
 I will wave my hands in praise and adoration,
 I will wave my hands in praise and adoration,
 Praise and adoration to the living God.
[V2]
 For He's given me hands that just love clapping:
 One, two, one, two, three,
 And He's given me a voice
 That just loves shouting:
 'Hallelujah!'
 ||He's given me feet that just love dancing:
 One, two, one, two, three,
 And He's put me in a being
 That has no trouble seeing
 That whatever I am feeling
 He is worthy to be praised.
