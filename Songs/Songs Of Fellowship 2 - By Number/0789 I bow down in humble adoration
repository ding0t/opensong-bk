  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I bow down in humble adoration,
 Speak Your name with love and devotion,
 Jesus, the Lamb sacrificed for me.
 I see Your face, Your tender hands
 Scarred for me.
 ||I fall at Your feet with songs of praises singing;
 My joy is complete, You fulfil my longing.
 Prophet of God, my Priest and my King,
 I worship and adore.
[V2]
 Before the Father's throne You ever intercede;
 You always hear my prayer, whatever I may plead.
 You wipe away my tears, You give me victory;
 By Your blood I am cleansed, I am free.
