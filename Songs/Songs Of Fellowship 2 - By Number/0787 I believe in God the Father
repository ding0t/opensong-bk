[C]
 I believe in God the Father,
 I believe in Jesus the Son:
 I believe in God the Holy Spirit,
 I believe in the Three in One.
[V1]
 I believe He was born of a virgin,
 Was crucified and buried in the ground.
 Descended into hell and won the battle,
 But the devil, death and hell
 Couldn't hold Him down.
[V2]
 O Lord, we're drowning in confusion,
 So many of us going separate ways;
 Wanting to be God is our delusion,
 But some of us are standing up,
 Not ashamed to say, I believe, I believe!
[V3]
 I believe He ascended into heaven,
 Where He sits at God's right hand;
 And I believe our King will be returning
 To judge the living and the dead,
 From every tribe and land.
