  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are the great I am,
 Forever You will be.
 Let every angel sing
 Of Your perfect authority.
 Every knee will bow
 And every tongue confess;
 You are the great I AM,
 The First and Last
[V2]
 Mighty, (Mighty)
 Eternal, (Eternal)
 Immortal, (Immortal)
 Awesome One. (Awesome One)
 Mysterious, (Mysterious)
 The Wonderful, (the Wonderful)
 The Holy One, (the Holy One)
 The Beginning and the End.
