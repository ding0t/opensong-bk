  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I sing a simple song of love
 To my Saviour, to my Jesus.
 I'm grateful for the things You've done,
 My loving Saviour, oh precious Jesus.
 My heart is glad that You've called me Your own;
 There's no place I'd rather be,
[V2]
 (Than) In Your arms of love,
 In Your arms of love,
 Holding me still,
 Holding me near
 In Your arms of love.
