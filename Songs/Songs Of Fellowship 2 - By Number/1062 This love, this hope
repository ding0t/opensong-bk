[V1]
 This love, this hope,
 This peace of God, this righteousness,
 This faith, this joy,
 This life complete in me.
[V2]
 Now healed and whole,
 And risen in His righteousness,
 I live in Him,
 He lives in me,
 And filled with this hope in God,
 Reflecting His glory.
[V3]
 Now is the time to worship You,
 Now is the time to offer You
 All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans;
 I lay it down.
 Now is the time to live for You,
 Now is the time I'm found in You.
 Now is the time Your kingdom comes.
