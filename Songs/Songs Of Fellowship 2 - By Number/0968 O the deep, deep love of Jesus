[V1]
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
 Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;
 Rolling as a mighty ocean
 In its fulness over me.
 Underneath me, all around me,
 Is the current of Thy love;
 Leading onward, leading homeward,
 To my glorious rest above.
[V2]
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
 Spread His praise from shore to shore,
 How He loveth, ever loveth,
 Changeth never, nevermore;
 How He watches o'er His loved ones,
 Died to call them all His own;
 How for them He intercedeth,
 Watches over them from the throne.
[V3]
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
 Love of every love the best:
 'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
 'Tis a haven sweet of rest.
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
 'Tis a heaven of heavens to me;
 And it lifts me up to glory,
 For it lifts me up to Thee.
