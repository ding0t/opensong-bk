[V1]
 No eye has seen,
 And no ear has heard,
 And no mind has ever conceived
 The glorious things
 That You have prepared
 For everyone who has believed;
 ||You brought us near and You called us Your own,
 And made us joint heirs with Your Son.
[C]
 How high and how wide,
 How deep and how long,
 How sweet and how strong is Your love;
 How lavish Your grace,
 How faithful Your ways,
 How great is Your love, O Lord.
[V2]
 Objects of mercy,
 Who should have known wrath,
 We're filled with unspeakable joy;
 Riches of wisdom
 Unsearchable wealth,
 And the wonder of knowing Your voice.
 ||You are our treasure and our great reward,
 Our hope and our glorious King.
