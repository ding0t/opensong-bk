[C]
 Our God is great.
 Our God is great.
 Our God is great.
 Our God is great.
[V1]
 He gave us the wind,
 The sun and the snow,
 The sand on the sea shore,
 The flowers that grow.
 Morning and evening,
 Winter and spring;
 Come join all creation and sing.
[V2]
 The gifts that He brings
 Are new every day,
 From glorious sunset
 To soft falling rain.
 The mist on the hills,
 The light and the shade;
 Come join all creation in praise.
[V3]
 For music and dancing,
 The sounds that we hear;
 For colours and words,
 The life that we share, we say:
