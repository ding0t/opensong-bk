  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are my king, (You are my King)
 And I love You.
 You are my King, (You are my King)
 And I worship You.
[V2]
 Kneeling before You now,
 All of my life I gladly give to You.
 Placing my hopes and dreams
 In Your hands,
 I give my heart to You.
[V3]
 I love You, love You, Jesus.
 Yes, I love You, love You, Jesus,
 My King.
