  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O God beyond all praising,
 We worship You today,
 And sing the love amazing
 That songs cannot repay;
 ||For we can only wonder
 At every gift you send,
 At blessings without number
 And mercies without end:
 We lift our hearts before You
 And wait upon Your word,
 We honour and adore You,
 Our great and mighty Lord.
[V2]
 Then hear, O gracious Saviour,
 Accept the love we bring,
 That we who know Your favour
 May serve You as our King;
 ||And whether our tomorrows
 Be filled with good or ill,
 We'll triumph through our sorrows
 And rise to bless You still:
 To marvel at Your beauty
 And glory in Your ways,
 And make a joyful duty
 Our sacrifice of praise!
