  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, I come before Your throne of grace;
 I find rest in Your presence
 And fulness of joy.
 In worship and wonder
 I behold Your face,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.
[C]
 What a faithful God have I,
 What a faithful God.
 What a faithful God have I,
 Faithful in every way.
[V2]
 Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry;
 Through the storm You're the beacon,
 My song in the night.
 In the shelter of Your wings,
 Hear my heart's reply,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.
[V3]
 Lord all sovereign, granting peace from heaven,
 Let me comfort those who suffer
 With the comfort You have given.
 I will tell of Your great love for as long as I live,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.
