[V1]
 La la la la la la. (x4)
 From the sleep of ages,
 I am stirred by the kiss of love,
 By the fragrant perfume
 When His name is mentioned.
 ||I have learned to wait for Him,
 To receive His presence
 With the sound of laughter,
 And the joy of resting.
 But listen, my Lover
 Is coming from heaven's throne!
[C]
 Over the mountains, leaping the hills,
 He runs like a deer through the open plain;
 Gazing through windows,
 Peering through doors,
 My Lover is calling and calling again:
 ||'Rise up, my lovely, beautiful one,
 The winter is past and the rains are gone;
 Flowers appear all over the earth,
 These are the promised days.'
 This is the season of singing. (x4)
[V2]
 There is no preferring
 In the Lover's loving;
 We are all His treasure,
 His desired inheritance.
 ||He has come with blessings
 From the Father's throne-room;
 Gifts of power and healing,
 For a needy people.
 The wonder, the pleasure
 Of knowing, of being known!
