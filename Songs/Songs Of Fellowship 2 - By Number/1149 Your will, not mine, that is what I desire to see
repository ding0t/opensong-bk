[V1]
 Your will, not mine, that is what I desire to see,
 Walking in righteousness, and holy liberty.
 Your life, not mine, that is what I desire to live,
 Forgiving others, as always You forgive.
[C]
 I bow before Your majesty,
 I fall before Your throne;
 I cannot understand Your love,
 But I claim it as my own.
 I rise and stand before You
 As a living sacrifice;
 I seek to do Your will, O God,
 For the rest of my life.
[V2]
 Your voice, not mine, that is what I desire to hear;
 Speak in the stillness and whisper in my ear.
 Your mind, not mine, that is what I desire to have;
 To prophesy Your word, release the captive heart.
[V3]
 Your race, not mine, that is what I desire to run;
 To finish off the work that others have begun.
 Your work, not mine, that is what I desire to do;
 To serve Your purposes, and worship only You.
