[V1]
 There's a river flowing from the throne,
 Not a gentle stream but powerful flow.
 It brings the city of our God such joy,
 And springs up fountains in her midst.
 ||On the banks the trees are full of life,
 The fruit just grows and grows all the year round.
 The leaves are green and never seem to die,
 They're for the healing of this world.
[C]
 There's a river, there's a river,
 There's a river flowing from the throne.
 There's a river, there's a river
 And it flows through out the world.
 ||There's a river, there's a river,
 There's a river flowing from the throne.
 There's a river, there's a river
 And it's flooding over me.
[V2]
 You invited me to come for free,
 Enjoy the feast You had prepared for me;
 Draw with laughter from Your sparkling wells,
 Bathe in Your river of delights.
 ||First You led me to the edge of the stream,
 Cautiously I put my ankles in;
 The thrill was just too much to describe,
 And I heard You call me deeper still!
