[V1]
 Well, I thank You, Lord,
 That You are my Saviour;
 You're my strength
 And You're the Rock on which I stand.
 You give me life,
 And a grace that's greater,
 When I humble myself
 Beneath Your mighty hand.
[C]
 You bring times of refreshing,
 You bring times of refreshing,
 You bring times of refreshing to my soul.
 When I'm weary from the fight,
 And trying to do what's right,
 You bring times of refreshing to my soul.
[V2]
 For the day will come
 When we'll all be gathered,
 And the sun will rise with healing in its wings;
 And all the years of pain
 Won't seem to matter,
 When our eyes behold
 Our Teacher and our King.
