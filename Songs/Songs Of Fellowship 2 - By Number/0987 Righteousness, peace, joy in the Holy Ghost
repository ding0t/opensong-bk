[V1]
 Righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost;
 Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,
 That's the kingdom of God.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Don't you want to be a part of the kingdom,
 Don't you want to be a part of the kingdom,
 Don't you want to be a part of the kingdom?
 Come on, everybody!
 (Repeat)
[V3]
 There's love in the kingdom,
 So much love in the kingdom;
 There's love in the kingdom.
 Come on, everybody!
[V4]
 There's peace in the kingdom,
 So much peace in the kingdom;
 There's peace in the kingdom.
 Come on, everybody!
[V5]
 There's joy in the kingdom,
 So much joy in the kingdom;
 There's joy in the kingdom.
 Come on, everybody!
[V6]
 I'm an heir of the kingdom,
 Yes an heir of the kingdom;
 I'm an heir of the kingdom.
 Come on, everybody!
