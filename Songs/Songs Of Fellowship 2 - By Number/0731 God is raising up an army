[V1]
 God is raising up an army
 Made of those who are still young.
 God is lifting up their voices,
 Through the weak He'll shame the strong.
 ||It's been prophesied they will prophesy,
 God's salvation they will show;
 For the promise is to the children,
 To our daughters and our sons.
[V2]
 Children of the cross,
 A shining example,
 Children of the cross
 Are singing His praise.
 Children of the cross
 Are silencing the enemy,
 Children of the cross
 Are saying the Lord saves.
