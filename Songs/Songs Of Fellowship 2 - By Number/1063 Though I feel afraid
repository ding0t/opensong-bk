[V1]
 Though I feel afraid
 Of territory unknown,
 I know that I can say
 That I do not stand alone.
 For Jesus, You have promised
 Your presence in my heart;
 I cannot see the ending,
 But it's here that I must start.
[C]
 And all I know is You have called me,
 And that I will follow is all I can say.
 I will go where You will send me,
 And Your fire lights my way.
[V2]
 What lies across the waves
 May cause my heart to fear;
 Will I survive the day,
 Must I leave what's known and dear?
 A ship that's in the harbour
 Is still and safe from harm,
 But it was not built to be there,
 It was made for wind and storm.
