[C]
 Send me out from here, Lord,
 To serve a world in need.
 May I know no man by the coat he wears,
 But the heart that Jesus sees.
 ||And may the light of Your face
 Shine upon me, Lord.
 You have filled my heart with the greatest joy,
 And my cup is overflowing.
[V1]
 'Go now, and carry the news
 To all creation, every race and tongue.
 Take no purse with you,
 Take nothing to eat
 For He will supply your needs.'
[V2]
 'Go now, bearing the light,
 Living for others,
 Fearlessly walking into the night;
 Take no thought for your lives,
 Like lambs among wolves,
 Full of the Spirit, ready to die.'
