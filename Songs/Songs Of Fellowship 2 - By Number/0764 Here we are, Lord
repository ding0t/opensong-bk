  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Here we are, Lord,
 More weak than strong;
 Still believing, still pressing on.
 Make us ready
 With hearts that are brave.
 We will silence the lies of this age.
[C]
 For such a moment we have been born.
 We're gonna rise up,
 Take this world by storm.
 Let evil tremble,
 We come in His name.
 Our God is with us,
 We're dangerous people.
[V2]
 All God's heroes failed as we do,
 Sometimes doubting all that is true.
 Yet He calls us great people of faith,
 Working through us as history is made.
