[V1]
 The name of the Lord is a strong tower;
 The name of the Lord brings refuge and strength.
 The name of the Lord gives hope to the hopeless;
 The name of the Lord breathes life to the dead.
[V2]
 The name of the Lord give strength to the weary,
 The name of the Lord brings freedom from fear;
 The name of the Lord gives peace to the restless,
 The name of the Lord will heal the oppressed.
[V3]
 O Lord, You never change,
 Holy God, You remain the same,
 For Your love, it never fades,
 Your faithfulness surrounds me.
[C]
 For You alone are God, and I bow before You.
 You alone are God, I worship, adore You.
 You alone are God, none other before You,
 And I offer up my life again.
[V4]
 The name of the Lord covers me with mercy,
 The name of the Lord brings everlasting joy;
 The name of the Lord will lift all myburdens,
 The name of the Lord, it makes mecomplete.
[V5]
 I call, and You answer me,
 For You know my every need.
 In Your love I put my trust,
 Your faithfulness surrounds me.
[V6]
 O taste and see
 That the Lord is good.
 How blessed is the man
 Who hides himself in Him.
