[V1]
 When morning gilds the skies
 My heart awaking cries:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
 Alike at work and prayer
 To Jesus I repair:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[V2]
 Does sadness fill my mind?
 A solace here I find:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
 When evil thoughts molest,
 With this I shield my breast:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[V3]
 To God, the Word, on high
 The hosts of angels cry:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
 Let mortals, too, upraise
 Their voice in hymns of praise:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[V4]
 Let earth's wide circle round
 In joyful notes resound:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
 Let air, and sea, and sky,
 From depth to height, reply:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[V5]
 Be this while life is mine
 My canticle divine:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
 Be this the eternal song,
 Through all the ages long:
 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
