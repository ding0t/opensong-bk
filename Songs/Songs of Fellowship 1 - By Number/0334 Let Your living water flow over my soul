  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Let Your living water flow over my soul.
 Let Your Holy Spirit come and take control
 Of every situation that has troubled my mind.
 All my cares and burdens on to You I roll.
[C]
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
 Father, Father, Father.
 Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.
[V2]
 Come now, Holy Spirit, and take control.
 Hold me in Your loving arms and make me whole.
 Wipe away all doubt and fear and take my pride,
 Draw me to Your love and keep me by Your side.
[V3]
 Give your life to Jesus, let Him fill your soul.
 Let Him take you in His arms and make you whole.
 As you give your life to Him He'll set you free.
 You will live and reign with Him eternally.
