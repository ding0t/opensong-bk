[V1]
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
 Into the house of the Lord,
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
 Into the house of the Lord.
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
 Into the house of the Lord,
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
 Into the house of the Lord.
[V2]
 And we offer up to You
 The sacrifices of thanksgiving,
 And we offer up to You
 The sacrifices of joy.
