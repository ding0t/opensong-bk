  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I am the bread of life,
 He who comes to Me shall not hunger,
 He who believes in Me shall not thirst.
 No one can come to Me
 Unless the Father draw him.
[C]
 And I will raise him up,
 And I will raise him up,
 And I will raise him up on the last day.
[V2]
 The bread that I will give
 Is My flesh for the life of the world,
 And he who eats of this bread,
 He shall live for ever,
 He shall live for ever.
[V3]
 Unless you eat
 Of the flesh of the Son of Man
 And drink of His blood,
 And drink of His blood,
 You shall not have life within you.
[V4]
 I am the resurrection,
 I am the life,
 He who believes in Me
 Even if he die,
 He shall live for ever.
[V5]
 Yes, Lord, we believe
 That You are the Christ,
 The Son of God
 Who has come
 Into the world.
