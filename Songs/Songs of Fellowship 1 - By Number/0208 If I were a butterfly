[V1]
 If I were a butterfly,
 I'd thank You, Lord, for giving me wings.
 And if I were a robin in a tree,
 I'd thank You, Lord, that I could sing.
 ||And if I were a fish in the sea,
 I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee;
 But I just thank You, Father,
 For making me 'me'.
[C]
 For You gave me a heart
 And You gave me a smile,
 You gave me Jesus
 And You made me Your child,
 And I just thank You, Father,
 For making me 'me'.
[V2]
 If I were an elephant,
 I'd thank You, Lord, by raising my trunk.
 And if I were a kangaroo,
 You know I'd hop right up to You.
 ||And if I were an octopus,
 I'd thank You, Lord, for my fine looks;
 But I just thank You, Father,
 For making me 'me'.
[V3]
 If I were a wiggily worm,
 I'd thank You, Lord, that I could squirm.
 And if I were a billy goat,
 I'd thank You, Lord, for my strong throat.
 ||And if I were a fuzzy-wuzzy bear,
 I'd thank You, Lord, for my fuzzy-wuzzy hair;
 But I just thank You, Father,
 For making me 'me'.
