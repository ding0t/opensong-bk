[V1]
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek, 
 That I may dwell in Your house, O Lord. 
 All of my days, all of my life, 
 That I may see You, Lord. 
[V2]
 Hear me, O Lord, hear me when I cry; 
 Lord, do not hide Your face from me. 
 You have been my strength, 
 You have been my shield, 
 And You will lift me up.
[C]
 One thing I ask, 
 One thing I desire 
 Is to see You, 
 Is to see You.
