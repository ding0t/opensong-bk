  <lyrics>
[V1]
 His voice is the sea
 And the sounding of the trumpets;
 And the calling of the Shepherd is so sweet.
 His face is the sun,
 Brighter than the morning;
 And all creation bows down at His feet.
[C]
 Jesus is Lord, and all the earth adores Him.
 Jesus is Lord, He sits upon the throne.
 When all men stand before Him,
 Then every knee shall bow,
 And every tongue cry 'Jesus is Lord.'
[V2]
 His mouth is a sword
 That rules o'er the nations,
 And His sword will draw His children to His side.
 His eyes are a fire
 That burns throughout the kingdom,
 And the burning purifies the Master's bride.
