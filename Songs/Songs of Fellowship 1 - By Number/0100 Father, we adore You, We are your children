  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father, we adore You,
 We are Your children gathered here;
 To be with You is our delight,
 A feast beyond compare.
[V2]
 Father, in Your presence
 There is such freedom to enjoy.
 We find in You a lasting peace
 That nothing can destroy.
[V3]
 You are the Fountain of life,
 You are the Fountain of life,
 And as we drink, we are more than satisfied
 By You, O Fountain of life.
