[V1]
 It is a thing most wonderful,
 Almost too wonderful to be,
 That God's own Son should come from heaven
 And die to save a child like me.
[V2]
 And yet I know that it is true;
 He came to this poor world below,
 And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died,
 Only because He loved us so.
[V3]
 I cannot tell how He could love
 A child so weak and full of sin;
 His love must be most wonderful,
 If He could die my love to win.
[V4]
 It is most wonderful to know
 His love for me so free and sure;
 But 'tis more wonderful to see
 My love for Him so faint and poor.
[V5]
 And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;
 O light the flame within my heart,
 And I will love Thee more and more,
 Until I see Thee as Thou art.
