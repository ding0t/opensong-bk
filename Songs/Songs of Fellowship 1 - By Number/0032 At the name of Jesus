[V1]
 At the name of Jesus
 Every knee shall bow,
 Every tongue confess Him
 King of glory now;
 'Tis the Father's pleasure
 We should call Him Lord,
 Who from the beginning
 Was the mighty Word.
[V2]
 Humbled for a season,
 To receive a name
 From the lips of sinners
 Unto whom He came;
 Faithfully He bore it
 Spotless to the last,
 Brought it back victorious,
 When from death He passed.
[V3]
 Bore it up triumphant
 With its human light,
 Through all ranks of creatures
 To the central height,
 To the throne of Godhead,
 To the Father's breast,
 Filled it with the glory
 Of that perfect rest.
[V4]
 In your hearts enthrone Him;
 There let Him subdue
 All that is not holy,
 All that is not true;
 Crown Him as your Captain
 In temptation's hour,
 Let His will enfold you
 In its light and power.
[V5]
 Brothers, this Lord Jesus
 Shall return again,
 With His Father's glory,
 With His angel-train;
 For all wreaths of empire
 Meet upon His brow,
 And our hearts confess Him
 King of glory now.
