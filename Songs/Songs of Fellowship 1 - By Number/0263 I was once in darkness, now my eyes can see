[V1]
 I was once in darkness, now my eyes can see,
 I was lost but Jesus sought and found me.
 O what love He offers, O what peace He gives,
 I will sing forever more, He lives.
[V2]
 Hallelujah Jesus! Hallelujah Lord!
 Hallelujah Father, I am shielded by Hisword.
 I will live forever, I will never die,
 I will rise up to meet Him in the sky.
