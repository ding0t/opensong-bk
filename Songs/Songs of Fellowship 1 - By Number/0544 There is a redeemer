  <lyrics>
[V1]
 There is a redeemer,
 Jesus, God's own Son,
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
 Holy One.
[C]
 Thank You, O my Father,
 For giving us Your Son,
 And leaving Your Spirit
 Till the work on earth is done.
[V2]
 Jesus my Redeemer,
 Name above all names,
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
 O for sinners slain.
[V3]
 When I stand in glory
 I will see His face,
 And there I'll serve my King forever
 In that holy place.
