[V1]
 I'm gonna thank the Lord, He set me free.
 I'm gonna thank the Lord, He set me free,
 For my Saviour He redeemed me,
 For my Saviour rescued me.
 Yes, I'm gonna thank the Lord, He set me free.
[V2]
 I'm gonna clap my hands and stamp my feet
 I'm gonna clap my hands and stamp my feet
 For my Saviour He redeemed me,
 For my Saviour rescued me.
 Yes, I'm gonna clap my hands and stamp my feet
[V3]
 I'm gonna sing and shout aloud for joy
 I'm gonna sing and shout aloud for joy
 For my Saviour He redeemed me,
 For my Saviour rescued me.
 Yes, I'm gonna sing and shout aloud for joy
[V4]
 I'm gonna raise my hands in victory 
 I'm gonna raise my hands in victory 
 For my Saviour He redeemed me,
 For my Saviour rescued me.
 Yes, I'm gonna raise my hands in victory
