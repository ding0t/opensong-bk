[C]
 Immanuel,
 God is with us,
 Immanuel,
 He is here.
 Immanuel,
 He is among us,
 Immanuel,
 His kingdom is here.
[V1]
 Wonderful Counsellor, they laughed at His wisdom,
 The Mighty God on a dusty road.
 Everlasting Father, a friend of sinners,
 The Prince of Peace in a cattle stall.
[V2]
 He was despised and rejected,
 A man of sorrows acquainted with grief.
 From Him we turned and hid our faces;
 He was despised, Him we did not esteem.
[V3]
 But He was wounded for our transgressions,
 He was bruised for our iniquities.
 On Him was the punishment that made us whole,
 And by His stripes we are healed.
[V4]
 He was oppressed, He was afflicted,
 And yet He opened not His mouth.
 Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
 Like a sheep before his shearers He did not speak.
