  <lyrics>
[V1]
 My soul longs for You, O my God;
 I seek You with all of my heart. 
 In this dry and thirsty land 
 My voice cries out to You; 
 Only Your presence can satisfy my need.
[V2]
 And so I enter into Your sanctuary, 
 To behold Your glory. 
 I'll give You my praise as long as I live, 
 Raise my hands, my life I'll give 
 To You, O I love You, Lord.
