[V1]
 Here is love vast as the ocean,
 Loving kindness as the flood,
 When the Prince of life, our ransom
 Shed for us His precious blood.
 ||Who His love will not remember?
 Who can cease to sing His praise?
 He can never be forgotten
 Throughout heaven's eternal days.
[V2]
 On the Mount of Crucifixion
 Fountains opened deep and wide;
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
 ||Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
 Poured incessant from above,
 And heaven's peace and perfect justice
 Kissed a guilty world in love.
