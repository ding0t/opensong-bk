[V1]
 Lord Jesus Christ,
 You have come to us,
 You are one with us,
 Mary's son.
 Cleansing our souls from all their sin,
 Pouring Your love and goodness in;
 Jesus, our love for You we sing,
 Living Lord.
[V2]
 Lord Jesus Christ,
 Now and every day,
 Teach us how to pray,
 Son of God.
 You have commanded us to do
 This in remembrance, Lord, of You:
 Into our lives Your power breaks through,
 Living Lord.
[V3]
 Lord Jesus Christ,
 You have come to us,
 Born as one of us,
 Mary's son.
 Led out to die on Calvary,
 Risen from death to set us free,
 Living Lord Jesus, help us see
 You are Lord.
[V4]
 Lord Jesus Christ,
 We would come to You,
 Live our lives for You,
 Son of God.
 All Your commands we know are true,
 Your many gifts will make us new,
 Into our lives Your power breaks through,
 Living Lord.
