[V1]
 O my saviour, lifted 
 From the earth for me, 
 Draw me, in Thy mercy, 
 Nearer unto Thee.
[V2]
 Lift my earthbound longings, 
 Fix them, Lord, above; 
 Draw me with the magnet 
 Of Thy mighty love.
[V3]
 And I come, Lord Jesus; 
 Dare I turn away? 
 No! Thy love hath conquered, 
 And I come today.
[V4]
 Bringing all my burdens,
 Sorrow, sin, and care;
 At Thy feet I lay them,
 And I leave them there.
