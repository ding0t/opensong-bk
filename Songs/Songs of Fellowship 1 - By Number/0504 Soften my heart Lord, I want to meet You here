[V1]
 Soften my heart Lord, I want to meet You here.
 Soften my heart Lord, tender me with tears,
 For Your presence is beyond anything I could desire;
 Soften my heart Lord, consume me with Your holy fire.
[V2]
 Soften my heart Lord, I have made a choice.
 Soften my heart Lord, I want to hear Your voice,
 For Your presence is beyond anything I could desire;
 Soften my heart Lord, consume me with Your holy fire.
