  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, come and heal Your church,
 Take our lives and cleanse with Your fire.
 Let Your deliverance flow,
 As we lift Your name up higher.
[C]
 We will draw near,
 And surrender our fear;
 Lift our hands to proclaim
 Holy Father, You are here.
[V2]
 Spirit of God, come in
 And release our hearts to praise You.
 Make us whole, for
 Holy we'll become, and serve You.
[V3]
 Show us Your power, we pray,
 That we might share in Your glory.
 We shall arise and go
 To proclaim Your works most holy.
