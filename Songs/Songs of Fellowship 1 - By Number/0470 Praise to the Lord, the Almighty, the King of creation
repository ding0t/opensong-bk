[V1]
 Praise to the Lord, 
 the Almighty, the King of creation!
 O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
 All ye who hear,
 Brothers and sisters, draw near,
 Praise Him in glad adoration.
[V2]
 Praise to the Lord,
 who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
 Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee:
 Ponder anew
 What the Almighty can do,
 Who with His love doth befriend thee.
[V3]
 Praise to the Lord, 
 who doth nourish thy life and restore thee,
 Fitting thee well for the tasks that are ever before thee,
 Then to thy need
 He like a mother doth speed,
 Spreading the wings of grace o'er thee.
[V4]
 Praise to the Lord,
 who when tempests their warfare are waging,
 Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,
 Biddeth them cease,
 Turneth their fury to peace,
 Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.
[V5]
 Praise to the Lord,
 who, when darkness of sin is abounding,
 Who, when the Godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,
 Sheddeth His light,
 Chaseth the horrors of night,
 Saints with His mercy surrounding.
[V6]
 Praise to the Lord!
 O let all that is in me adore Him!
 All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
 Let the Amen
 Sound from His people again:
 Gladly for aye we adore Him.
