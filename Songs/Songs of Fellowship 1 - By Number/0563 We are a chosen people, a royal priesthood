  <lyrics>
[C]
 We are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
 A holy nation, belonging to God.
 We are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
 A holy nation, belonging to God.
[V1]
 You have called us out of darkness
 To declare Your praise.
 We exalt You and enthrone You,
 Glorify Your name.
[V2]
 You have placed us into Zion
 In the new Jerusalem.
 Thousand thousand are their voices,
 Singing to the Lamb.
