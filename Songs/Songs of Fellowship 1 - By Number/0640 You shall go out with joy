  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You shall go out with joy
 And be led forth with peace,
 And the mountains and the hills
 Shall break forth before you.
 There'll be shouts of joy,
 And the trees of the field
 Shall clap, shall clap their hands.
[V2]
 And the trees of the field shall clap their hands,
 And the trees of the field shall clap their hands,
 And the trees of the field shall clap their hands,
 And you'll go out with joy.
