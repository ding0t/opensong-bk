[V1]
 When we walk with the Lord
 In the light of His word,
 What a glory He sheds on our way!
 While we do His good will,
 He abides with us still,
 And with all who will trust and obey!
[C]
 Trust and obey!
 For there's no other way
 To be happy in Jesus,
 But to trust and obey.
[V2]
 Not a shadow can rise,
 Not a cloud in the skies,
 But His smile quickly drives it away;
 Not a doubt nor a fear,
 Not a sigh nor a tear,
 Can abide while we trust and obey!
[V3]
 Not a burden we bear,
 Not a sorrow we share,
 But our toil He doth richly repay:
 Not a grief nor a loss,
 Not a frown nor a cross,
 But is blessed if we trust and obey!
[V4]
 But we never can prove
 The delights of His love
 Until all on the altar we lay;
 For the favour He shows,
 And the joy He bestows,
 Are for those who will trust and obey.
[V5]
 Then in fellowship sweet
 We will sit at His feet,
 Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
 What He says we will do,
 Where He sends we will go;
 Never fear, only trust and obey!
