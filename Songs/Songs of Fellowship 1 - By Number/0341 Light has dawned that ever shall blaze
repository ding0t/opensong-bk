[C]
 Light has dawned that ever shall blaze;
 Darkness flees away.
 Christ the light has shone in our hearts,
 Turning night to day.
 ||We proclaim Him King of kings,
 We lift high His name.
 Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet
 When He comes to reign.
[V1]
 Saviour of the world is He,
 Heaven's King come down.
 Judgement, love and mercy meet
 At His thorny crown.
[V2]
 Life has sprung from hearts of stone,
 By the Spirit's breath.
 Hell shall let her captives go,
 Life has conquered death.
[V3]
 Blood has flowed that cleanses from sin,
 God His love has proved.
 Men may mock and demons may rage,
 We shall not be moved!
