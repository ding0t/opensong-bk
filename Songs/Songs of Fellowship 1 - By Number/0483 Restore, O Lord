  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Restore, O Lord, 
 The honour of Your name, 
 In works of sovereign power 
 Come shake the earth again;
 That men may see 
 And come with reverent fear 
 To the living God,
 Whose kingdom shall outlast the years.
[V2]
 Restore, O Lord, 
 In all the earth Your fame, 
 And in our time revive 
 The church that bears Your name. 
 And in Your anger,
 Lord, remember mercy, 
 O living God, 
 Whose mercy shall outlast the years.
[V3]
 Bend us, O Lord, 
 Where we are hard and cold, 
 In Your refiner's fire 
 Come purify the gold. 
 Though suffering comes 
 And evil crouches near, 
 Still our living God 
 Is reigning, He is reigning here.
[V4]
 Restore, O Lord, 
 The honour of Your name, 
 In works of sovereign power 
 Come shake the earth again;
 That men may see 
 And come with reverent fear 
 To the living God,
 Whose kingdom shall outlast the years.
