[V1]
 Father in heaven, how we love You,
 We lift Your name in all the earth.
 May Your kingdom be established in our praises
 As Your people declare Your mighty works.
[C]
 Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
 Who was and is and is to come;
 Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
 Who reigns forever more.
