[V1]
 Father, we love You,
 We worship and adore You,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
[V2]
 Jesus, we love You,
 We worship and adore You,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
[V3]
 Spirit, we love You,
 We worship and adore You,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name,
 Glorify Your name in all the earth.
