[V1]
 Blest be the tie that binds
 Our hearts in Christian love;
 The fellowship of kindred minds
 Is like to that above.
[V2]
 Before our Father's throne
 We pour our ardent prayers;
 Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
 Our comforts and our cares.
[V3]
 We share our mutual woes,
 Our mutual burdens bear,
 And often for each other flows
 The sympathising tear.
[V4]
 When for a while we part,
 This thought will soothe our pain,
 That we shall still be joined in heart,
 And hope to meet again.
[V5]
 This glorious hope revives
 Our courage by the way,
 While each in expectation lives,
 And longs to see the day.
[V6]
 From sorrow, toil and pain,
 And sin we shall be free;
 And perfect love and friendship reign
 Through all eternity.
