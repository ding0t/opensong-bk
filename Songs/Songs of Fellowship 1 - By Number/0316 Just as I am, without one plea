[V1]
 Just as I am, without one plea
 But that Thy blood was shed for me,
 And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V2]
 Just as I am, and waiting not
 To rid my soul of one dark blot,
 To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V3]
 Just as I am, though tossed about
 With many a conflict, many a doubt,
 Fightings and fears within, without,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V4]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
 Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
 Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V5]
 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
 Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,
 Because Thy promise I believe,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V6]
 Just as I am, Thy love unknown
 Has broken every barrier down;
 Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
[V7]
 Just as I am, of that free love
 The breadth, length, depth and height to prove,
 Here for a season, then above,
 O Lamb of God, I come.
