  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You, O Lord, rich in mercy, 
 Because of Your great love. 
 You, O Lord, so loved us, 
 Even when we were dead in our sins.
[V2]
  (Men) 
 You made us alive together with Christ, 
 And raised us up together with Him, 
 And seated us with Him in heavenly places, 
 And raised us up together with Him, 
 And seated us with Him in heavenly places in Christ.
[V3]
  (Women) 
 You made us alive together with Christ, 
 And raised us up, 
 And seated us, 
 And raised us up, 
 And seated us in Christ.
