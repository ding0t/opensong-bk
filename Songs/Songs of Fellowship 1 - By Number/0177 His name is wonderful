[V1]
 His name is wonderful,
 His name is Wonderful,
 His name is Wonderful,
 Jesus my Lord.
 He is the mighty King,
 Master of everything,
 His name is Wonderful,
 Jesus my Lord.
[V2]
 He's the great Shepherd,
 The Rock of all ages,
 Almighty God is He.
 Bow down before Him,
 Love and adore Him,
 His name is Wonderful,
 Jesus my Lord.
