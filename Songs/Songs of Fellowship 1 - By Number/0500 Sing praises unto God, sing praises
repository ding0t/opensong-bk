[V1]
 Sing praises unto God, sing praises, 
 Sing praises unto God, sing praises, 
 Sing praises unto God, sing praises, 
 Hallelujah!
  (Repeat)
[V2]
 For God is the King over all the earth, 
 Sing praises unto Him with understanding. 
 O clap your hands and shout, all ye people, 
 For He is to be greatly praised.
