  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Give me life, Holy Spirit,
 Guide my steps in Your sight;
 Help me always give You pleasure,
 Keep me walking in Your light.
 Give me life, Holy Spirit,
 Fill me now, make us one;
 I will dwell with You forever,
 In the Father and the Son.
[C]
 I will dwell with You,
 I will dwell with You.
 I will dwell with You
 In the Father and the Son.
