[V1]
 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live,
 I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
 My meditation of Him shall be sweet,
 I will be glad, I will be glad in the Lord.
[V2]
 Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
 Praise ye the Lord.
 Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
 Praise ye the Lord.
 Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
 Praise ye the Lord.
 Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
 Praise ye the Lord.
