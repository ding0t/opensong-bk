  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In the presence of Your people
 I will praise Your name,
 For alone You are holy,
 Enthroned in the praises of Israel.
 Let us celebrate Your goodness
 And Your steadfast love,
 May Your name be exalted
 Here on earth and in heaven above.
[V2]
 Lai, lai, lai-lai-lai-lai-lai-lai ... (etc.)
