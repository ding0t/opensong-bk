[V1]
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
 And all that is within me
 Bless His holy name.
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
 And all that is within me
 Bless His holy name.
[V2]
 King of kings, (for ever and ever,)
 Lord of Lords, (for ever and ever,)
 King of kings, (for ever and ever,)
 King of kings and Lord of Lords.
