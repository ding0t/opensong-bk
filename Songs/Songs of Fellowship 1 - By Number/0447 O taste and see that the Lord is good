  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O taste and see that the Lord is good, 
 How blessed is the man who hides himself in Him. 
 I sought the Lord and He answered me 
 And set me free from all my fears.
[V2]
 I will give thanks to Him, for He is good, 
 His steadfast love to me will never end. 
 I will give thanks to Him, for He is good, 
 His steadfast love to me will never end.
