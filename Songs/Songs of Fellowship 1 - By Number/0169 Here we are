[V1]
 Here we are,
 Gathered together as a family;
 Bound as one,
 Lifting up our voices
 To the King of kings.
 We cry:
[C1]
 Abba, Father, worthy is Your name.
 Abba, Father, worthy is Your name.
[V2]
 Here we are,
 Singing together as a family;
 Bound as one,
 Lifting up our voices
 To the King of kings.
 We sing:
[C2]
 Abba, Father, holy is Your name.
 Abba, Father, holy is Your name.
