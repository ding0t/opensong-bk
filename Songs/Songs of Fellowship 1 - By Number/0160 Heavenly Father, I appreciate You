[V1]
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate You.
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate You.
 I love You, adore You,
 I bow down before You.
 Heavenly Father, I appreciate You.
[V2]
 Son of God, what a wonder You are.
 Son of God, what a wonder You are.
 You cleansed my soul from sin,
 You set the Holy Ghost within.
 Son of God, what a wonder You are.
[V3]
 Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.
 Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.
 You lead us, You guide us,
 You live right inside us.
 Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.
