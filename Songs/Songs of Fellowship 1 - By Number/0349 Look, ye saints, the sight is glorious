[V1]
 Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
 See the Man of Sorrows now,
 From the fight returned victorious;
 Every knee to Him shall bow:
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crowns become the Victor's brow.
[V2]
 Crown the Saviour, angels, crown Him;
 Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
 In the seat of power enthrone Him,
 While the vault of heaven rings:
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crown the Saviour, King of kings!
[V3]
 Sinners in derision crowned Him,
 Mocking thus the Saviour's claim;
 Saints and angels throng around Him,
 Own His title, praise His name:
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Spread abroad the Victor's fame.
[V4]
 Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
 Hark, those loud triumphant chords!
 Jesus takes the highest station:
 O what joy the sight affords!
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 Crown Him! Crown Him!
 King of kings, and Lord of Lords!
