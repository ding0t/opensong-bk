[V1]
 Come, let us sing of a wonderful love,
 Tender and true;
 Out of the heart of the Father above,
 Streaming to me and to you:
 Wonderful love
 Dwells in the heart of the Father above.
[V2]
 Jesus, the Saviour, this gospel to tell,
 Joyfully came;
 Came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell,
 Sharing their sorrow and shame;
 Seeking the lost,
 Saving, redeeming at measureless cost.
[V3]
 Jesus is seeking the wanderers yet;
 Why do they roam?
 Love only waits to forgive and forget;
 Home, weary wanderer, home!
 Wonderful love
 Dwells in the heart of the Father above.
[V4]
 Come to my heart, O Thou wonderful love,
 Come and abide,
 Lifting my life, till it rises above
 Envy and falsehood and pride,
 Seeking to be
 Lowly and humble, a learner of Thee.
