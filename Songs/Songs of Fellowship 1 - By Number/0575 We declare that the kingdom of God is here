[C1]
 We declare that the kingdom of God is here,
 We declare that the kingdom of God is here,
 Among you, among you.
   (Men and women in canon)
[C2]
 We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Men)
 We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Women)
 We declare that the (Men)
 Kingdom of God is here. (All)
[V1]
 The blind see, the deaf hear,
 The lame men are walking;
 Sicknesses flee at His voice.
 The dead live again,
 And the poor hear the good news:
 Jesus is King, so rejoice!
