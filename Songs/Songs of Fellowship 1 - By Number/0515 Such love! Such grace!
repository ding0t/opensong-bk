  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Such love! Such grace! 
 Makes the pieces come falling into place, 
 Breaks through the darkness, 
 Turns on the light, 
 Making blindness give way to sight. 
 ||Your love has conquered, 
 Has set us free 
 To become all You've called us to be,
 Healing the wounded, making us stand, 
 Bringing peace and a sword in our hand.
[V2]
 And no power in the universe 
 Can separate us from the love of God. 
 We're Yours forever 
 With nothing to fear, 
 Willing slaves to the love that brought us here.
