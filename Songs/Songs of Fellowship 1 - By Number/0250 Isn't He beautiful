[V1]
 Isn't He beautiful, beautiful isn't he?
 Prince of Peace, Son of God, isn't He?
 Isn't He wonderful, wonderful isn't He?
 Counsellor, Almighty God, 
 isn't He, isn't He, isn't He?
[V2]
 Yes you are beautiful, beautiful yes you are?
 Prince of Peace, Son of God, yes you are?
 Yes you are wonderful, wonderful yes you are?
 Counsellor, Almighty God, 
 yes you are, yes you are, yes you are?
