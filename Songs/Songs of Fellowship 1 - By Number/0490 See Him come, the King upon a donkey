  <lyrics>
[V1]
 See Him come, the King upon a donkey. 
 Where is all His majesty and power? 
 He who was glorious, yet for my sake 
 Put away glory to die upon the cross. 
 ||His body was broken, 
 His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.
[V2]
 See the people line His path with palm leaves; 
 Hear the children shouting out His name. 
 He who was glorious, yet for my sake 
 Put away power to die upon the cross. 
 ||His body was broken, 
 His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.
