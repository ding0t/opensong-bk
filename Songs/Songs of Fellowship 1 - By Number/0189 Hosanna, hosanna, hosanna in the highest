[V1]
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest.
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest.
 Lord we lift up Your name, with hearts full of praise,
 Be exalted, O Lord, my God,
 Hosanna in the highest.
[V2]
 Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings.
 Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings.
 Lord, we lift up Your name, with hearts full of praise,
 Be exalted, O Lord, my God,
 Glory to the King of kings.
