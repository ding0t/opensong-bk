[C1]
 I believe in Jesus:
 I believe He is the Son of God.
 I believe He died and rose again,
 I believe He paid for us all.
[V1]
 (Men) And I believe He's here now,
 (Women) I believe that He is here,
 (All) Standing in our midst.
 (Men) Here with the power to heal now,
 (Women) With the power to heal,
 (All) And the grace to forgive.
[C2]
 I believe in You, Lord;
 I believe You are the Son of God.
 I believe You died and rose again,
 I believe You paid for us all.
[V2]
 (Men) And I believe You're here now,
 (Women) I believe that You're here,
 (All) Standing in our midst.
 (Men) Here with the power to heal now,
 (Women) With the power to heal,
 (All) And the grace to forgive.
