[C1]
 The earth is the Lord's (Men)
 And everything in it, (Women)
 The earth is the Lord's, (Men)
 The work of His hands. (Women)
 The earth is the Lord's (Men)
 And everything in it; (Women)
 And all things were made (AlI)
 For His glory. 
[V1]
 The mountains are His,
 The seas and the islands,
 The cities and towns,
 The houses and streets.
 Let rebels bow down
 And worship before Him,
 For all things were made
 For His glory. 
[C2]
 And all things were made,
 Yes, all things were made,
 And all things were made
 For His glory.
