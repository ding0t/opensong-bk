[V1]
 Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,
 In the city of our God,
 In the mountain of His holiness.
 ||Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth
 Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north,
 The city of the great King,
 Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north,
 The city of the great King.
[V2]
 One body, one Spirit, one faith, one Lord,
 One people, one nation, praise ye the Lord.
