[V1]
 Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,
 Longing for Thy gracious word,
 Longing for Thy voice that cheereth;
 Master, let it now be heard.
 I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
 What hast Thou to say to me?
[V2]
 Speak to me by name, O Master,
 Let me know it is to me;
 Speak, that I may follow faster,
 With a step more firm and free,
 Where the Shepherd leads the flock
 In the shadow of the rock.
[V3]
 Master, speak! though least and lowest,
 Let me not unheard depart;
 Master, speak! for O Thou knowest
 All the yearning of my heart,
 Knowest all its truest need;
 Speak and make me blessed indeed.
[V4]
 Master, speak! and make me ready,
 When Thy voice is truly heard,
 With obedience glad and steady
 Still to follow every word.
 I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
 Master, speak! O speak to me!
