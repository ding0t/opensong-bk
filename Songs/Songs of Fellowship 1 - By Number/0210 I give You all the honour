  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I give You all the honour
 And praise that's due Your name,
 For You are the King of glory,
 The Creator of all things.
[C]
 And I worship You,
 I give my life to You,
 I fall down on my knees.
 Yes, I worship You,
 I give my life to You,
 I fall down on my knees.
[V2]
 As Your Spirit moves upon me now
 You meet my deepest need,
 And I lift my hands up to Your throne,
 Your mercy I've received.
[V3]
 You have broken chains that bound me,
 You've set this captive free;
 I will lift my voice to praise Your name
 For all eternity.
