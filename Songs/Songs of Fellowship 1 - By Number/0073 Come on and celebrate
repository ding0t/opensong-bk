[V1]
 Come on and celebrate
 His gift of love, we will celebrate
 The Son of God who loved us
 And gave us life.
 ||We'll shout Your praise, O King,
 You give us joy nothing else can bring,
 We'll give to You our offering
 In celebration praise.
[C]
 Come on and celebrate,
 Celebrate,
 Celebrate and sing,
 Celebrate and sing to the King.
 Come on and celebrate,
 Celebrate,
 Celebrate and sing,
 Celebrate and sing to the King.
