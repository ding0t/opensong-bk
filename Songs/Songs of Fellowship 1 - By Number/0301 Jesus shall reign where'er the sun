[V1]
 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
 Doth his successive journeys run;
 His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
 Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[V2]
 For Him shall endless prayer be made,
 And praises throng to crown His head;
 His name like sweet perfume shall rise
 With every morning sacrifice.
[V3]
 People and realms of every tongue
 Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
 And infant voices shall proclaim
 Their early blessings on His name.
[V4]
 Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
 The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
 The weary find eternal rest,
 And all the sons of want are blessed.
[V5]
 Let every creature rise and bring
 Peculiar honours to our King;
 Angels descend with songs again,
 And earth repeat the loud Amen!
