[C]
 O magnify the Lord with me, 
 And let us exalt His name together.
 O magnify the Lord with me, 
 And let us exalt His name together.
[V1]
 I called to the Lord and He answered, 
 Saved me from all of my trouble; 
 He delivered me from all my fear, 
 So I'll rejoice, I'll rejoice!
[V2]
 We will boast about the Lord, 
 Tell of the things He has done; 
 Let the whole world hear about it, 
 And they'll rejoice, they'll rejoice!
[V3]
 We will magnify Jesus together; 
 We will magnify You, O Lord. 
 We will magnify Jesus together; 
 We will magnify You, O Lord.
