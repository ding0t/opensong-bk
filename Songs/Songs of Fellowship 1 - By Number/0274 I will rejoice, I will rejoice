  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will rejoice, I will rejoice,
 I will rejoice in the Lord with my whole heart.
 I will rejoice, I will rejoice,
 I will rejoice in the Lord.
[V2]
 You anoint my head with oil,
 And my cup surely overflows,
 Goodness and love shall follow me
 All the days that I dwell in Your house.
