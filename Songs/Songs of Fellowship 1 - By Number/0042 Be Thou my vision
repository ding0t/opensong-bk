[V1]
 Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
 Be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;
 Be Thou my best thought in the day and the night,
 Both waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.
[V2]
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word,
 Be Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord;
 Be Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
 Be Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
[V3]
 Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight;
 Be Thou my whole armour, be Thou my true might;
 Be Thou my soul's shelter, be Thou my strong tower:
 O raise Thou me heavenward, great Power of my power.
[V4]
 Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise:
 Be Thou mine inheritance now and always;
 Be Thou and Thou only the first in my heart:
 O Sovereign of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
[V5]
 High King of heaven, Thou heaven's bright Sun,
 O grant me its joys after victory is won;
 Great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
 Still be Thou my vision, O Ruler of all.
