[V1]
 Let God speak and I will listen,
 Let God speak, there's things I'm needing to put right.
 Let God speak and I will obey what He says,
 Please God, I want to hear Your voice tonight.
[V2]
 Lord I want to hear Your voice,
 Lord I want to hear Your voice,
 Lord I want to hear Your voice
 Tonight, tonight.
