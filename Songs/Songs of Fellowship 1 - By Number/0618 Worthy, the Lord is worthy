  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Worthy, the Lord is worthy,
 And no one understands the greatness of His name.
 Gracious, so kind and gracious,
 And slow to anger, and rich, so rich in love.
[C]
 My mouth will speak in praise of my Lord, 
 Let every creature praise His holy name. 
 For ever, and ever more. 
 For ever, and ever more. 
 For ever, and ever more. 
 For ever, and ever more.
[V2]
 Faithful, the Lord is faithful 
 To all His promises, and loves all He has made. 
 Righteous, in all ways righteous, 
 And He is near to all who call on Him in truth.
