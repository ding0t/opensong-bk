  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I have made a covenant with my chosen,
 Given My servant My word.
 I have made Your name to last forever,
 Built to outlast all time.
[C]
 I will celebrate Your love forever, Yahweh,
 Age on age my words proclaim Your love.
 For I claim that love is built to last forever,
 Founded firm Your faithfulness.
[V2]
 Yahweh, that assembly of those who love You
 Applaud Your marvellous word.
 Who in the skies can compare with Yahweh?
 Who can rival Him?
[V3]
 Happy the people who learn to acclaim You,
 They rejoice in Your light.
 You are our glory and You are our courage,
 Our hope belongs to You.
[V4]
 I have revealed My chosen servant
 And He can rely on Me,
 Given Him My love to last forever,
 He shall rise in My name.
[V5]
 He will call to Me, 'My Father, My God!'
 For I make Him My firstborn Son.
 I cannot take back My given promise,
 I've called Him to shine like the sun.
