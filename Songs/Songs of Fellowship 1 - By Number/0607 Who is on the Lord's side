[V1]
 Who is on the Lord's side? 
 Who will serve the King? 
 Who will be His helpers 
 Other lives to bring? 
 Who will leave the world's side? 
 Who will face the foe? 
 Who is on the Lord's side? 
 Who for Him will go? 
 ||By Thy call of mercy, 
 By Thy grace divine, 
 We are on the Lord's side;
 Saviour, we are Thine.
[V2]
 Jesus, Thou hast bought us 
 Not with gold or gem, 
 But with Thine own life-blood, 
 For Thy diadem. 
 With Thy blessing filling 
 Each who comes to Thee 
 Thou hast made us willing, 
 Thou hast made us free. 
 ||By Thy grand redemption, 
 By Thy grace divine, 
 We are on the Lord's side;
 Saviour, we are Thine.
[V3]
 Fierce may be the conflict, 
 Strong may be the foe, 
 But the King's own army 
 None can overthrow; 
 Round His standard ranging 
 Victory is secure; 
 For His truth unchanging 
 Makes the triumph sure. 
 ||Joyfully enlisting, 
 By Thy grace divine, 
 We are on the Lord's side;
 Saviour, we are Thine.
[V4]
 Chosen to be soldiers 
 In an alien land, 
 Chosen, called, and faithful, 
 For our Captain's band; 
 In the service royal 
 Let us not grow cold, 
 Let us be right loyal,
 Noble, true, and bold. 
 ||Master, Thou wilt keep us, 
 By Thy grace divine, 
 Always on the Lord's side,
 Saviour, always Thine.
