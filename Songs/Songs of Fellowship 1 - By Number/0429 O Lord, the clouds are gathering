[V1]
 O Lord, the clouds are gathering, 
 The fire of judgement burns, 
 How we have fallen! 
 O Lord, You stand appalled to see
 Your laws of love so scorned, 
 And lives so broken.
[C]
 Have mercy, Lord, (Men)
 Have mercy, Lord, (Women)
 Forgive us, Lord, (Men)
 Forgive us, Lord, (Women)
 Restore us, Lord, (All)
 Revive Your church again.
 ||Let justice flow (Men)
 Let justice flow (Women)
 Like rivers, (Men)
 Like rivers, (Women)
 And righteousness like a
 Never failing stream.        (All)
[V2]
 O Lord, over the nations now 
 Where is the dove of peace? 
 Her wings are broken. 
 O Lord, while precious children starve 
 The tools of war increase; 
 Their bread is stolen.
[V3]
 O Lord, dark powers are poised to flood 
 Our streets with hate and fear; 
 We must awaken! 
 O Lord, let love reclaim the lives 
 That sin would sweep away 
 And let Your kingdom come.
[V4]
 Yet, O Lord, Your glorious cross shall tower 
 Triumphant in this land, 
 Evil confounding. 
 Through the fire Your suffering church display 
 The glories of her Christ: 
 Praises resounding!
