[V1]
 Worthy, O worthy are You, Lord, 
 Worthy to be thanked and praised 
 And worshipped and adored. 
 Worthy, O worthy are You, Lord, 
 Worthy to be thanked and praised 
 And worshipped and adored.
[V2]
 Singing, Hallelujah, Lamb upon the throne, 
 We worship and adore You, make Your glory known. 
 Hallelujah, glory to the King: 
 You're more than a conqueror, 
 You're Lord of everything.
