[V1]
 Hark! the herald angels sing:
 'Glory to the new-born King!
 Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
 God and sinners reconciled!'
 ||Joyful, all ye nations rise,
 Join the triumph of the skies,
 With the angelic host proclaim,
 'Christ is born in Bethlehem.'
 Hark! the herald angels sing:
 'Glory to the new-born King!'
[V2]
 Christ, by highest heaven adored,
 Christ, the everlasting Lord,
 Late in time behold Him come,
 Offspring of a virgin's womb.
 ||Veiled in flesh the Godhead see!
 Hail the incarnate Deity!
 Pleased as man with man to dwell,
 Jesus, our Immanuel.
 Hark! the herald angels sing:
 'Glory to the new-born King.'
[V3]
 Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
 Hail, the Sun of righteousness!
 Light and life to all He brings,
 Risen with healing in His wings,
 ||Mild, He lays His glory by;
 Born that men no more may die;
 Born to raise the sons of earth;
 Born to give them second birth.
 Hark! the herald angels sing:
 'Glory to the new-born King.'
