[V1]
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord! 
 Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice; 
 Tender to me the promise of His word; 
 In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.
[V2]
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name! 
 Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done; 
 His mercy sure, from age to age the same; 
 His holy name - the Lord, the mighty One.
[V3]
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might! 
 Powers and dominions lay their glory by; 
 Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight, 
 The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.
[V4]
 Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word! 
 Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure: 
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord 
 To children's children and forever more!
