  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O, that You would bless me, 
 And enlarge my borders, 
 That Your hand would be with me, 
 O Lord, O Lord. 
 O, that You would keep me, 
 Keep me from all evil, 
 So that I may not be ashamed, 
 O Lord, O Lord.
[C]
 May Your kingdom come, 
 May Your will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven; 
 May Your kingdom come, 
 May Your will be done 
 Through me, O Lord, O Lord.
[V2]
 O, that You would fill me, 
 Fill me with Your Spirit, 
 So that I may know Your power, 
 O Lord, O Lord. 
 O, that You would use me 
 To fulfil Your purposes, 
 That through me Your glory would shine, 
 O Lord, O Lord.
