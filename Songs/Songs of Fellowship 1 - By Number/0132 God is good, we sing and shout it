[V1]
 God is good, we sing and shout it.
 God is good, we celebrate.
 God is good, no more we doubt it.
 God is good, we know it's true.
[V2]
 And when I think of His love for me,
 My heart fills with praise
 And I feel like dancing.
 For in His heart there is room for me,
 And I run with arms open wide.
