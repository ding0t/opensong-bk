[V1]
 Morning has broken
 Like the first morning;
 Blackbird has spoken
 Like the first bird.
 Praise for the singing!
 Praise for the morning!
 Praise for them, springing
 Fresh from the Word!
[V2]
 Sweet the rain's new fall
 Sunlit from heaven,
 Like the first dewfall
 On the first grass.
 Praise for the sweetness
 Of the wet garden,
 Sprung in completeness
 Where His feet pass.
[V3]
 Mine is the sunlight!
 Mine is the morning
 Born of the one light
 Eden saw play!
 Praise with elation,
 Praise every morning,
 God's re-creation
 Of the new day!
