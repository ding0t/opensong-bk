[V1]
 As with gladness men of old
 Did the guiding star behold;
 As with joy they hailed its light,
 Leading onward, beaming bright,
 So, most gracious God, may we
 Evermore be led by Thee.
[V2]
 As with joyful steps they sped,
 Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
 There to bend the knee before
 Thee whom heaven and earth adore,
 So may we with willing feet
 Ever seek Thy mercy-seat.
[V3]
 As they offered gifts most rare
 At Thy cradle rude and bare,
 So may we with holy joy,
 Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
 All our costliest treasures bring,
 Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
[V4]
 Holy Jesus, every day
 Keep us in the narrow way;
 And, when earthly things are past,
 Bring our ransomed souls at last
 Where they need no star to guide,
 Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
[V5]
 In the heavenly country bright
 Need they no created light;
 Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
 Thou its sun, which goes not down.
 There forever may we sing
 Hallelujahs to our King.
