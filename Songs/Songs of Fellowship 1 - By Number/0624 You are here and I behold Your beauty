  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are here and I behold Your beauty, 
 Your glory fills this place. 
 Calm my heart to hear You, 
 Cause my eyes to see You. 
 Your presence here is the answer 
 To the longing of my heart.
[V2]
 I lift my voice to worship and exalt You, 
 For You alone are worthy. 
 A captive now set free,
 Your kingdom's come to me. 
 Glory in the highest, 
 My heart cries unto You.
