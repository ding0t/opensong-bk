  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I have found such joy in my salvation
 Since I gave my heart to You,
 I have found the reason I'm living,
 So in love, so near to You.
[C]
 I worship You, my Lord,
 With all my life, praise Your name.
 I worship You, worship You, my Lord.
[V2]
 Oh my Lord, my life I'm giving,
 A living sacrifice to You.
 Oh my Lord, the reason I'm living
 Is to serve and worship You.
