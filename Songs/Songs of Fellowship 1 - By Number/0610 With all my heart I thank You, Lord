[V1]
 With all my heart I thank You, Lord. 
 With all my heart I thank You, Lord, 
 For this bread and wine we break, 
 For this sacrament we take, 
 For the forgiveness that You make, 
 I thank You, Lord.
[V2]
 With all my soul I thank You, Lord. 
 With all my soul I thank You, Lord, 
 For this victory that You've won, 
 For this taste of things to come, 
 For this love that makes us one, 
 I thank You, Lord.
[V3]
 With all my voice I thank You, Lord. 
 With all my voice I thank You, Lord, 
 For the sacrifice of pain, 
 For the Spirit and the flame, 
 For the power of Your name, 
 I thank You, Lord.
