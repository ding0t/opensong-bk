  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Higher, higher,
 Higher, higher, higher,
 Higher, higher, lift up Jesus higher.
 Higher, higher,
 Higher, higher, higher,
 Higher, higher, lift up Jesus higher.
[C]
 Cast your burdens onto Jesus,
 He cares for you.
 Cast your burdens onto Jesus,
 He cares for you.
[V2]
 Lower, lower,
 Lower, lower, lower,
 Lower, lower, lower Satan lower.
 Lower, lower,
 Lower, lower, lower,
 Lower, lower, lower Satan lower.
