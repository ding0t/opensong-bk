  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Immanuel, O Immanuel,
 Bowed in awe I worship at Your feet,
 And sing Immanuel, God is with us;
[V2]
 Sharing my humanness, my shame,
 Feeling my weaknesses, my pain,
 Taking the punishment, the blame,
 Immanuel.
 And now my words cannot explain,
 All that my heart cannot contain,
 How great are the glories of Your name,
 Immanuel.
