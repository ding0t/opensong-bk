[V1]
 Crown Him with many crowns,
 The Lamb upon His throne;
 Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
 All music but its own!
 Awake, my soul, and sing
 Of Him who died for thee,
 And hail Him as thy matchless King
 Through all eternity.
[V2]
 Crown Him the Lord of life,
 Who triumphed o'er the grave
 And rose victorious in the strife
 For those He came to save:
 His glories now we sing,
 Who died and rose on high,
 Who died eternal life to bring
 And lives that death may die.
[V3]
 Crown Him the Lord of love;
 Behold His hands and side,
 Those wounds yet visible above
 In beauty glorified:
 No angel in the sky
 Can fully bear that sight,
 But downward bends His burning eye
 At mysteries so bright.
[V4]
 Crown Him the Lord of peace,
 Whose power a sceptre sways
 From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
 And all be prayer and praise:
 His reign shall know no end,
 And round His pierced feet
 Fair flowers of paradise extend
 Their fragrance ever sweet.
[V5]
 Crown Him the Lord of years,
 The Potentate of time,
 Creator of the rolling spheres,
 Ineffably sublime!
 All hail, Redeemer, hail!
 For Thou hast died for me;
 Thy praise shall never, never fail
 Throughout eternity.
