  <lyrics>
[V1]
 No-one but You, Lord,
 Can satisfy the longing in my heart. 
 Nothing I do, Lord,
 Can take the place of drawing near to You.
[C]
 Only You can fill my deepest longing, 
 Only You can breathe in me new life;
 Only You can fill my heart with laughter, 
 Only You can answer my heart's cry.
[V2]
 Father, I love You, 
 Come satisfy the longing in my heart. 
 Fill me, overwhelm me, 
 Until I know Your love deep in my heart.
