[V1]
 I know not why God's wondrous grace
 To me hath been made known;
 Nor why, unworthy as I am,
 He claimed me for His own.
[C]
 But I know whom I have believed;
 And am persuaded that He is able
 To keep that which I've committed
 Unto Him against that day.
[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith
 To me He did impart;
 Or how believing in His word
 Wrought peace within my heart.
[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves,
 Convincing men of sin;
 Revealing Jesus through the word,
 Creating faith in Him.
[V4]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me,
 Of weary ways or golden days
 Before His face I see.
[V5]
 I know not when my Lord may come;
 I know not how, nor where;
 If I shall pass the vale of death,
 Or 'meet Him in the air'.
