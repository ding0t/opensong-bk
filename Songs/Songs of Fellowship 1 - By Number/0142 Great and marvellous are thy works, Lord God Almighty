  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Great and marvellous are thy works,
 Lord God Almighty;
 Just and true are Thy ways, O Lord,
 For You are the King of saints.
[V2]
 Who shall not fear Thee,
 Who shall not glorify Thy name, O Lord?
 For only Thou art holy.
 ||All the nations shall come and worship before Thee,
 For Thy judgements are made manifest.
 For Thy judgements are made manifest.
[V3]
 Hallelujah, (hallelujah)
 Hallelujah to the King of saints.
 Glory hallelujah, (glory hallelujah)
 Glory hallelujah to the King of saints.
