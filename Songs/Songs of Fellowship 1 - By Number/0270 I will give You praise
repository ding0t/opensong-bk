[V1]
 I will give You praise,
 I will sing Your song,
 I will bless Your holy name;
 For there is no other God
 Who is like unto You,
 You're the only way.
[V2]
 Only You are the Author of life,
 Only You can bring the blind their sight,
 Only You are called Prince of Peace,
 Only You promised You'd never leave.
 Only You are God.
