[V1]
 An army of ordinary people,
 A kingdom where love is the key,
 A city, a light to the nations,
 Heirs to the promise are we.
 A people whose life is in Jesus,
 A nation together we stand.
 Only through grace are we worthy,
 Inheritors of the land.
[C]
 A new day is dawning,
 A new age to come,
 When the children of promise
 Shall flow together as one.
 A truth long neglected,
 But the time has now come
 When the children of promise
 Shall flow together as one.
[V2]
 A people without recognition,
 But with Him a destiny sealed,
 Called to a heavenly vision,
 His purpose shall be fulfilled.
 Come, let us stand strong together,
 Abandon ourselves to the King,
 His love shall be ours forever,
 This victory song we shall sing.
