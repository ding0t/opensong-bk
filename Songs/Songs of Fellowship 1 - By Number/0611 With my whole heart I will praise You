[V1]
 With my whole heart I will praise You, 
 Holding nothing back, Hallelujah! 
 You have made me glad and now 
 I come with open arms to thank You, 
 With my heart embrace, Hallelujah! 
 ||I can see Your face is smiling. 
 With my whole life I will serve You, 
 Captured by Your love, Hallelujah! 
 O amazing love, O amazing love!
[V2]
 Lord, Your heart is overflowing 
 With a love divine, Hallelujah! 
 And this love is mine for ever. 
 Now Your joy has set You laughing 
 As You join the song, Hallelujah! 
 ||Heaven sings along, I hear the 
 Voices swell to great crescendos, 
 Praising Your great love, Hallelujah! 
 O amazing love, O amazing love!
[V3]
 Come, O Bridegroom, clothed in splendour, 
 My Beloved One, Hallelujah! 
 How I long to run and meet You. 
 You're the fairest of ten thousand, 
 You're my life and breath, Hallelujah! 
 ||Love as strong as death has won me. 
 All the rivers, all the oceans 
 Cannot quench this love, Hallelujah! 
 O amazing love, O amazing love!
