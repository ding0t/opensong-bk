[V1]
 Your mercy flows upon us like a river. 
 Your mercy stands unshakeable and true. 
 Most holy God, of all good things the Giver, 
 We turn and lift our fervent prayer to You.
[C]
 Hear our cry, (echo)
 O Lord, (echo)
 Be merciful (echo)
 Once more; (echo)
 Let Your love (echo)
 Your anger stem, (echo)
 Remember mercy, O Lord, again.
[V2]
 Your church once great, though standing clothed in sorrow, 
 Is even still the bride that You adore; 
 Revive Your church, that we again may honour 
 Our God and King, our Master and our Lord.
[V3]
 As we have slept, this nation has been taken
 By every sin ever known to man;
 So at its gates, though burnt by fire and broken,
 In Jesus' name we come to take our stand.
