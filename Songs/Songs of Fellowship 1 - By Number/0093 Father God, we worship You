  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father God, we worship You,
 Make us part of all You do.
 As You move among us now
 We worship You.
[V2]
 Jesus King, we worship You,
 Help us listen now to You.
 As You move among us now
 We worship You.
[V3]
 Spirit pure, we worship You,
 With Your fire our zeal renew.
 As You move among us now
 We worship You.
