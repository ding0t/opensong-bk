[V1]
 O come, O come, Immanuel, 
 And ransom captive Israel, 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear.
[C]
 Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel.
[V2]
 O come, O come, Thou Lord of might 
 Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height 
 In ancient times didst give the law 
 In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
[V3]
 O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free 
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny; 
 From depths of hell Thy people save 
 And give them victory o'er the grave.
[V4]
 O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by Thine advent here; 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight.
[V5]
 O come, Thou Key of David, come 
 And open wide our heavenly home; 
 Make safe the way that leads on high, 
 And close the path to misery.
