  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord how majestic You are,
 My eyes meet Your gaze
 And my burden is lifted.
 Your word is a lamp to my feet,
 Your hand swift to bless
 And Your banner a shield.
[C]
 You are my everything,
 You who made earth and sky and sea,
 All that You've placed inside of me
 Calls out Your name.
 ||To You I bow,
 The King who commands my every breath,
 The Man who has conquered sin and death,
 My Lord and my King,
 My everything!
[V2]
 Lord, how resplendent You are,
 When I think of Your heavens,
 The work of Your fingers -
 What is man, that You are mindful of him?
 Yet You've crowned him with glory
 And caused him to reign!
