[V1]
 I'm accepted, I'm forgiven,
 I am fathered by the true and living God.
 I'm accepted, no condemnation,
 I am loved by the true and living God.
[V2]
 There's no guilt or fear as I draw near
 To the Saviour and Creator of the world.
 There is joy and peace
 As I release my worship to You, O Lord.
