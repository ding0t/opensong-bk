  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God of grace, I turn my face
 To You, I cannot hide;
 My nakedness, my shame, my guilt,
 Are all before Your eyes.
[V2]
 Strivings and all anguished dreams
 In rags lie at my feet,
 And only grace provides the way
 For me to stand complete.
[V3]
 And Your grace clothes me inrighteousness,
 And Your mercy covers me in love.
 Your life adorns and beautifies,
 I stand complete in You.
