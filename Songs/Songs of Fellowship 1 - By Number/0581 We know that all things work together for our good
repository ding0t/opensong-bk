[V1]
 We know that all things work together for our good
 For good to those who love the Lord;
 For God has called us to be just like His Son,
 To live and walk according to His word.
[C]
 We are more than conquerors,
 We are more than conquerors,
 Through Christ, through Christ.
[V2]
 I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
 Nor angels, principalities, nor powers,
 Nor things that are now, nor things that are to come,
 Can separate us from the love of Christ.
[V3]
 If God is for us, who against us can prevail?
 No one can bring a charge against His chosen ones;
 And there will be no separation from our Lord,
 He has justified us through His precious blood.
