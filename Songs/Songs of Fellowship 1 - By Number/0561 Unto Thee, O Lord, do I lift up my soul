  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul,
 Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
[C]
 O my God, I trust in Thee,
 Let me not be ashamed,
 Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
[V2]
 Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed,
 Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed.
[V3]
 Show me Thy ways, Thy ways, O Lord,
 Teach me Thy paths, Thy paths, O Lord.
[V4]
 Remember not the sins of my youth,
 Remember not the sins of my youth.
[V5]
 The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him,
 The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.
[V6]
 Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul,
 Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
