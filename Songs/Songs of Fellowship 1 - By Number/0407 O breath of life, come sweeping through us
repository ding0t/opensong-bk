[V1]
 O breath of life, come sweeping through us, 
 Revive Thy church with life and power. 
 O Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us, 
 And fit Thy church to meet this hour.
[V2]
 O Wind of God, come, bend us, break us, 
 Till humbly we confess our need; 
 Then in Thy tenderness remake us, 
 Revive, restore; for this we plead.
[V3]
 O Breath of Love, come, breathe within us,
 Renewing thought and will and heart: 
 Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us, 
 Revive Thy church in every part.
[V4]
 Revive us, Lord! is zeal abating 
 While harvest fields are vast and white? 
 Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting, 
 Equip Thy church to spread the light.
