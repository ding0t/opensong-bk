  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O Lord, You are my light, 
 O Lord, You are my salvation.
 You have delivered me from all my fear, 
 For You are the defence of my life.
[V2]
 For my life is hidden with Christ in God,
 You have concealed me in Your love,
 You've lifted me up, placed my feet on a rock;
 I will shout for joy in the house of God.
