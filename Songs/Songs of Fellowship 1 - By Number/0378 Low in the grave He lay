[V1]
 Low in the grave He lay,
 Jesus, my Saviour,
 Waiting the coming day,
 Jesus, my Lord:
[C]
 Up from the grave He arose,
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
 And He lives for ever with His saints to reign:
 He arose! He arose!
 Alleluia! Christ arose!
[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed,
 Jesus, my Saviour;
 Vainly they seal the dead,
 Jesus, my Lord:
[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey,
 Jesus, my Saviour;
 He tore the bars away,
 Jesus, my Lord:
