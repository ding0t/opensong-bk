  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Father, we adore You,
 You've drawn us to this place.
 We bow down before You,
 Humbly on our face.
[C]
 All the earth shall worship
 At the throne of the King.
 Of His great and awesome power,
 We shall sing!
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 Jesus, we love You,
 Because You first loved us;
 You reached out and healed us
 With Your mighty touch.
[V3]
 Spirit, we need You
 To lift us from this mire;
 Consume and empower us
 With Your holy fire.
[V4]
 Faithful is He;
 Awesome is He;
 Saviour is He;
 Master is He;
 Mighty is He;
 Have mercy on me.
