[C]
 Let God arise
 And let His enemies be scattered;
 And let those who hate Him
 Flee before Him.
 Let God arise,
 And let His enemies be scattered;
 And let those who hate Him
 Flee away.
[V1]
 (Men)
 But let the righteous be glad,
 Let them exult before God,
 Let them rejoice with gladness,
 Building up a highway for the King.
 We go in the name of the Lord,
 Let the shout go up
 In the name of the Lord.
[V2]
 (Women)
 The righteous be glad,
 Let them exult before God,
 O let them rejoice
 For the King,
 In the name of the Lord.
