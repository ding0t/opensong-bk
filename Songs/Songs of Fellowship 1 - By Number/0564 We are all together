  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We are all together
 To call upon Your name;
 There is nothing we like better
 Than to sing and give You praise.
[C]
 Lord, we welcome You,
 We welcome You,
 We welcome You,
 Come fill this place.
[V2]
 Bring healing and salvation, 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Right here just like in heaven, 
 Lord, may Your will be done.
[V3]
 Father, come fill this place,
 We welcome You;
 Jesus, we seek Your face,
 'Cause all we want to do
 Is give our love to You.
