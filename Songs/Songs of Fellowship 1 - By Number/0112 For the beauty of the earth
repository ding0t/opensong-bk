[V1]
 For the beauty of the earth,
 For the beauty of the skies,
 For the love which from our birth
 Over and around us lies:
 Father, unto Thee we raise
 This our sacrifice of praise.
[V2]
 For the beauty of each hour
 Of the day and of the night,
 Hill and vale, and tree and flower,
 Sun and moon, and stars of light:
 Father, unto Thee we raise
 This our sacrifice of praise.
[V3]
 For the joy of human love,
 Brother, sister, parent, child,
 Friends on earth, and friends above;
 For all gentle thoughts and mild:
 Father, unto Thee we raise
 This our sacrifice of praise.
[V4]
 For each perfect gift of Thine
 To our race so freely given,
 Graces, human and divine,
 Flowers of earth, and buds of heaven:
 Father, unto Thee we raise
 This our sacrifice of praise.
