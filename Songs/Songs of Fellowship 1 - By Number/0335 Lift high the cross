[C]
 Lift high the cross.
 Lift high the cross.
 In majesty,
 In victory.
[V1]
 Here raged the fight, (Women echo)
 Darkness and light. (Women echo)
 All heaven and hell (Women echo)
 Battled here. (All)
[V2]
 Here once for all (Women echo)
 Was sacrificed (Women echo)
 The Lamb of God, (Women echo)
 Jesus Christ. (All)
[V3]
 Raise now your voices give glory and praise Him, (Leader - AII echo)
 For He has poured out His blood as a ransom. (Leader - AII echo)
 Hell's power is broken and heaven stands open, (Leader - AII echo)
 Lift high the cross. (All)
