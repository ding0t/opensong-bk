[V1]
 He who would valiant be
 'Gainst all disaster,
 Let him in constancy
 Follow the Master.
 There's no discouragement
 Shall make him once relent
 His first avowed intent
 To be a pilgrim.
[V2]
 Who so beset him round
 With dismal stories,
 Do but themselves confound -
 His strength the more is.
 No foes shall stay his might,
 Though he with giants fight;
 He will make good his right
 To be a pilgrim.
[V3]
 Since, Lord, Thou dost defend
 Us with Thy Spirit,
 We know we at the end
 Shall life inherit.
 Then fancies flee away!
 I'll fear not what men say,
 I'll labour night and day
 To be a pilgrim.
