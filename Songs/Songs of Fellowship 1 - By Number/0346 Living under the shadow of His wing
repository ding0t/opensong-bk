  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Living under the shadow of His wing
 We find security.
 Standing in His presence we will bring
 Our worship, worship, worship to the King.
[V2]
 Bowed in adoration at His feet
 We dwell in harmony.
 Voices joined together that repeat,
 Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.
[V3]
 Heart to heart embracing in His love
 Reveals His purity.
 Soaring in my spirit like a dove,
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
