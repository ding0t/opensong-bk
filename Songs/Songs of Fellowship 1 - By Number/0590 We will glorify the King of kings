  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We will glorify the King of kings,
 We will glorify the Lamb;
 We will glorify the Lord of Lords,
 Who is the great 'I Am'.
[V2]
 Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty,
 We will bow before His throne;
 We will worship Him in righteousness,
 We worship Him alone.
[V3]
 He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth,
 He is Lord of all who live;
 He is Lord above the universe,
 All praise to Him we give.
[V4]
 Hallelujah to the King of kings,
 Hallelujah to the Lamb;
 Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords,
 Who is the great 'l Am'.
