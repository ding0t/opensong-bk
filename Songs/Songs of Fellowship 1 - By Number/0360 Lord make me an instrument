[V1]
 Lord make me an instrument,
 An instrument of worship;
 I lift up my hands in Your name.
 Lord make me an instrument,
 An instrument of worship;
 I lift up my hands in Your name.
[C1]
 I'll sing You a love song,
 A love song of worship,
 I'll lift up my hands in Your name.
 I'll sing You a love song,
 A love song to Jesus,
 I'll lift up my hands in Your name.
[V3]
 For we are a symphony,
 A symphony of worship;
 We lift up our hands in Your name.
 For we are a symphony,
 A symphony of worship;
 We lift up our hands in Your name.
[C2]
 We'll sing You a love song,
 A love song of worship,
 We'll lift up our hands in Your name.
 We'll sing You a love song,
 A love song to Jesus,
 We'll lift up our hands in Your name.
