[V1]
 O come let us adore him, 
 O come let us adore Him, 
 O come let us adore Him, 
 Christ the Lord.
[V2]
 For He alone is worthy,
 For He alone is worthy,
 For He alone is worthy,
 Christ the Lord.
[V3]
 We'll give Him all the glory,
 We'll give Him all the glory,
 We'll give Him all the glory,
 Christ the Lord.
