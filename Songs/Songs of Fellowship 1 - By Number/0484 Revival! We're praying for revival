[C]
 Revival! We're praying for revival, 
 That Your kingdom may come, 
 Your will may be done 
 Throughout this land. 
 (Repeat)
[V1]
 Send now Your Spirit, Lord, may He come; 
 Cause us to glorify Jesus Your Son, 
 That all in this nation might know 
 He is the Lord. 
 ||Send now Your Spirit, let truth arise; 
 Where darkness has blinded, open closed eyes, 
 Bring spiritual health to this nation 
 As we cry to You: 
 Come heal our land. 
 Come heal our land. 
 Come heal our land. 
 Come heal our land.
