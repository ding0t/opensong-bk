[V1]
 Jesus is king and I will extol Him,
 Give Him the glory, and honour His name.
 He reigns on high, enthroned in theheavens,
 Word of the Father, exalted for us.
[V2]
 We have a hope that is steadfast and certain,
 Gone through the curtain and touching the throne.
 We have a Priest who is there interceding,
 Pouring His grace on our lives day by day.
[V3]
 We come to Him, our Priest and Apostle,
 Clothed in His glory and bearing His name,
 Laying our lives with gladness before Him;
 Filled with His Spirit we worship the King.
[V4]
 O Holy One, our hearts do adore You;
 Thrilled with Your goodness we give You our praise.
 Angels in light with worship surround Him,
 Jesus, our Saviour, forever the same.
