  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I lift my voice to praise Your name,
 That through my life I might proclaim
 The praises of the One who reigns:
 Jesus, my Lord.
[V2]
 Like a mighty flame that burns so bright,
 I am a bearer of His light.
 No longer I, for He is my life:
 Jesus, my Lord.
[V3]
 Jesus, Jesus, alive in me.
 Jesus, Jesus, setting me free.
