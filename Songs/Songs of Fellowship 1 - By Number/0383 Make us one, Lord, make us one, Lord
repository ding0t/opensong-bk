  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Make us one, Lord, make us one, Lord,
 By Your Spirit, make us one, Lord.
 We are members of one body,
 Make us one, Lord, we pray.
[V2]
 Every tribe and nation
 Is represented here,
 Watching with each other
 As the day of Christ draws near;
 Worshipping the Saviour
 Who died to set us free,
 We belong together;
 We are family.
