[V1]
 O for a heart to praise my God, 
 A heart from sin set free; 
 A heart that always feels Thy blood 
 So freely shed for me;
[V2]
 A heart resigned, submissive, meek, 
 My great Redeemer's throne, 
 Where only Christ is heard to speak, 
 Where Jesus reigns alone;
[V3]
 A humble, lowly, contrite heart, 
 Believing, true, and clean; 
 Which neither life nor death can part 
 From Him who dwells within;
[V4]
 A heart in every thought renewed, 
 And full of love divine; 
 Perfect and right, and pure, and good: 
 A copy, Lord, of Thine.
[V5]
 Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
 Come quickly from above;
 Write Thy new name upon my heart,
 Thy new best name of love.
