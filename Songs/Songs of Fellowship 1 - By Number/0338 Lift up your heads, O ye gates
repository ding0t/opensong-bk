  <lyrics>
[C]
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
 And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors.
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
 And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors;
 And the King of glory shall come in,
 The King of glory shall come in,
 The King of glory shall come in.
[V1]
 (Women)
 Who is the King of glory?
 What is His name?
 (Men)
 The Lord strong and mighty,
 The Lord, mighty in battle, strong to save.
[V2]
 (Women)
 Who shall ascend the hill,
 The hill of the Lord?
 (Men)
 Even he that hath clean hands
 And a pure heart with which to praise his God.
