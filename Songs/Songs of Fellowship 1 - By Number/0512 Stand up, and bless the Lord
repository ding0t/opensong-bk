[V1]
 Stand up, and bless the Lord, 
 Ye people of His choice; 
 Stand up, and bless the Lord your God 
 With heart, and soul, and voice.
[V2]
 Though high above all praise, 
 Above all blessing high, 
 Who would not fear His holy name, 
 And laud and magnify?
[V3]
 O for the living flame 
 From His own altar brought, 
 To touch our lips, our minds inspire, 
 And wing to heaven our thought!
[V4]
 God is our strength and song, 
 And His salvation ours; 
 Then be His love in Christ proclaimed 
 With all our ransomed powers.
[V5]
 Stand up, and bless the Lord, 
 The Lord your God adore; 
 Stand up, and bless His glorious name 
 Henceforth forever more.
