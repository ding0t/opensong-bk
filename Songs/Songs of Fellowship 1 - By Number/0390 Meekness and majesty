  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Meekness and majesty,
 Manhood and Deity,
 In perfect harmony,
 The Man who is God.
 Lord of eternity
 Dwells in humanity,
 Kneels in humility
 And washes our feet.
[C]
 O what a mystery,
 Meekness and majesty.
 Bow down and worship
 For this is your God,
 This is your God.
[V2]
 Father's pure radiance,
 Perfect in innocence,
 Yet learns obedience
 To death on a cross.
 Suffering to give us life,
 Conquering through sacrifice,
 And as they crucify
 Prays: 'Father forgive.'
[V3]
 Wisdom unsearchable,
 God the invisible,
 Love indestructible
 In frailty appears.
 Lord of infinity,
 Stooping so tenderly,
 Lifts our humanity
 To the heights of His throne.
