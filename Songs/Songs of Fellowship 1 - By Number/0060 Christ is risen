[C]
 Christ is risen!
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 Christ is risen!
 Risen indeed, hallelujah!
[V1]
 Love's work is done,
 The battle is won:
 Where now, O death, is your sting?
 He rose again
 To rule and to reign,
 Jesus our conquering King.
[V2]
 Lord over sin,
 Lord over death,
 At His feet Satan must fall!
 Every knee bow,
 All will confess
 Jesus is Lord over all!
[V3]
 Tell it abroad
 'Jesus is Lord!'
 Shout it and let your praise ring!
 Gladly we raise
 Our songs of praise,
 Worship is our offering.
