[V1]
 Jesus! the name high over all,
 In hell, or earth, or sky;
 Angels and men before it fall,
 And devils fear and fly,
 And devils fear and fly.
[V2]
 Jesus! the name to sinners dear,
 The name to sinners given;
 It scatters all their guilty fear,
 It turns their hell to heaven,
 It turns their hell to heaven.
[V3]
 Jesus! the prisoners' fetters breaks,
 And bruises Satan's head;
 Power into strengthless souls it speaks,
 And life into the dead,
 And life into the dead.
[V4]
 O that the world might taste and see
 The riches of His grace!
 The arms of love that compass me
 Would all mankind embrace,
 Would all mankind embrace.
[V5]
 His only righteousness I show,
 His saving grace proclaim;
 'Tis all my business here below
 To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!'
 To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!'
[V6]
 Happy if with my latest breath
 I might but gasp His name;
 Preach Him to all, and cry in death:
 'Behold, behold the Lamb!'
 'Behold, behold the Lamb!'
