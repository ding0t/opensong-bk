  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I am a lighthouse, a shining and bright house,
 Out in the waves of a stormy sea.
 The oil of the Spirit keeps my lamp burning;
 Jesus, my Lord, is the light in me.
 ||And when people see the good things that I do,
 They'll give praises to God who has sent us Jesus.
 We'll send out a lifeboat of love and forgiveness
 And give them a hand to get in.
[V2]
 While the storm is raging, whoosh, whoosh,
 And the wind is blowing, ooo, ooo,
 And the waves are crashing,
 Crash! crash! crash! crash!
