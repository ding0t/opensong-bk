[C]
 I'm not alone for my Father is with me,
 With me wherever I go.
 Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love,
 He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
[V1]
 Waking in the morning,
 Getting ready for school,
 Walking down the road;
 In class, at work, or at play,
 He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
[V2]
 And when I find myself in a mess,
 I can trust in Him;
 Call on His name and watch Him move,
 He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
[V3]
 All of my life, everywhere that I go,
 I will walk with Him;
 Praising Him and blessing His name,
 He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
