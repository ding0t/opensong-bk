[V1]
 Lord of Lords, king of kings,
 Maker of heaven and earth and all good things,
 We give You glory.
 Lord Jehovah, Son of Man,
 Precious Prince of Peace and the great I AM,
 We give You glory.
[C]
 Glory to God!
 Glory to God!
 Glory to God Almighty,
 In the highest!
[V2]
 Lord, You're righteous in all Your ways.
 We bless Your holy name and we will give You praise,
 We give You glory.
 You reign forever in majesty,
 We praise You and lift You up for eternity,
 We give You glory.
