[C]
 Thine, O Lord, is the greatness,
 And the power and the glory.
 Thine, O Lord, is the victory,
 And majesty, and majesty.
[V1]
 All that is in heaven and earth is Thine,
 Thou art exalted as head over all!
[V2]
 In Thy hand is power and might to make great,
 In Thy hand is power to give strength to all!
[V3]
 Now is come salvation and power and might,
 For the kingdom of our God has been given to His Christ!
