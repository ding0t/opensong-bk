  <lyrics>
[C]
 I have a destiny I know I shall fulfil,
 I have a destiny in that city on a hill.
 I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish,
 For I know I was born for such a time as this.
[V1]
 Long before the ages You predestined me
 To walk in all the works You have prepared for me.
 You've given me a part to play in history
 To help prepare a bride for eternity.
[V2]
 I did not choose You but You have chosen me
 And appointed me for bearing fruit abundantly.
 I know You will complete the work begun in me,
 By the power of Your Spirit working mightily.
