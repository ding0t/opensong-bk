  <lyrics>
[C]
 Broken for me, broken for you,
 The body of Jesus, broken for you.
[V1]
 He offered His body, He poured out His soul;
 Jesus was broken, that we might be whole:
[V2]
 Come to My table and with Me dine;
 Eat of My bread and drink of My wine.
[V3]
 This is My body given for you;
 Eat it remembering I died for you.
[V4]
 This is My blood I shed for you;
 For your forgiveness, making you new.
