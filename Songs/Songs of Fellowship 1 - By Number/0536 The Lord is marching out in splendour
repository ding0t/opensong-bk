  <lyrics>
[V1]
 The Lord is marching out in splendour,
 In awesome majesty He rides,
 For truth, humility and justice,
 His mighty army fills the skies.
[C]
 O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures,
 O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures,
 O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures,
 For ever, for ever.
[V2]
 His army marches out with dancing
 For He has filled our hearts with joy.
 Be glad the kingdom is advancing,
 The love of God our battle cry!
