  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will praise You all my life;
 I will sing to You with my whole heart.
 I will trust in You, my hope and my help,
 My Maker and my faithful God.
[V2]
 O faithful God, O faithful God,
 You lift me up and You uphold my cause;
 You give me life, You dry my eyes,
 You're always near, You're a faithful God.
