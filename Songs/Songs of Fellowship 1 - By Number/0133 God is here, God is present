[V1]
 God is here, God is present,
 God is moving by His Spirit;
 Can you hear what He is saying,
 Are you willing to respond?
 God is here, God is present,
 God is moving by His Spirit;
 Lord, I open up my life to You,
 Please do just what You will.
[V2]
 Lord, I won't stop loving You,
 You mean more to me than anything else.
 Lord, I won't stop loving You,
 You mean more to me than life itself.
