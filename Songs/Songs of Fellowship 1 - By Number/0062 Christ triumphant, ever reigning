[V1]
 Christ triumphant, ever reigning,
 Saviour, Master, King,
 Lord of heaven, our lives sustaining,
 Hear us as we sing:
[C]
 Yours the glory and the crown,
 The high renown, the eternal name.
[V2]
 Word incarnate, truth revealing,
 Son of Man on earth!
 Power and majesty concealing
 By your humble birth:
[V3]
 Suffering Servant, scorned, ill-treated,
 Victim crucified!
 Death is through the cross defeated,
 Sinners justified:
[V4]
 Priestly King, enthroned forever
 High in heaven above!
 Sin and death and hell shall never
 Stifle hymns of love:
[V5]
 So, our hearts and voices raising
 Through the ages long,
 Ceaselessly upon You gazing,
 This shall be our song:
