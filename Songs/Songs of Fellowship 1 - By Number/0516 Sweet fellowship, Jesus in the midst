[V1]
 Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst, 
 Life blossoms in the church, 
 Men by men are blessed 
 When Jesus is in the midst.
[V2]
 Peace and harmony - Jesus reigning here; 
 The church moves at His command,
 No room for doubt or fear, 
 For Jesus is reigning here.
[V3]
 I've never known a time like this, 
 Feel the spirit within me rise. 
 Come and see what God is doing. 
 Lord, we love You.
[V4]
 Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst, 
 Life blossoms in the church, 
 Men by men are blessed 
 When Jesus is in the midst.
