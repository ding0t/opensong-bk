  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will build My church, (men)
 I will build My church, (Women)
 And the gates of hell (Men)
 And the gates of hell (Women)
 Shall not prevail (Men)
 Shall not prevail (Women)
 Against it. (All)
 (Repeat)
[C]
 So you powers in the heavens above, bow down!
 And you powers on the earth below, bow down!
 And acknowledge that Jesus,
 Jesus, Jesus is Lord, is Lord.
