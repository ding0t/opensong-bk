  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Great and wonderful are Thy wondrous deeds,
 O Lord God the Almighty.
 Just and true are all Thy ways, O Lord,
 King of the ages art Thou.
[V2]
 Who shall not fear and glorify
 Thy name, O Lord?
 For Thou alone art holy,
 Thou alone.
 All the nations shall come and worship Thee,
 For Thy glory shall be revealed.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Amen.
[V3]
 Lai, lai, lai ... (etc.)
