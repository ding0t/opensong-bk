[C]
 Rejoice! Rejoice! 
 Christ is in you, 
 The hope of glory 
 In our hearts. 
 He lives! He lives! 
 His breath is in you, 
 Arise a mighty army, 
 We arise.
[V1]
 Now is the time for us 
 To march upon the land, 
 Into our hands 
 He will give the ground we claim. 
 He rides in majesty 
 To lead us into victory, 
 The world shall see 
 That Christ is Lord!
[V2]
 God is at work in us 
 His purpose to perform, 
 Building a kingdom 
 Of power not of words, 
 Where things impossible, 
 By faith shall be made possible; 
 Let's give the glory 
 To Him now.
[V3]
 Though we are weak, His grace 
 Is everything we need; 
 We're made of clay 
 But this treasure is within. 
 He turns our weaknesses 
 Into His opportunities, 
 So that the glory 
 Goes to Him.
