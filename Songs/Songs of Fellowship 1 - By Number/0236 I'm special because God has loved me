[V1]
 I'm special because God has loved me,
 For He gave the best thing that He had to save me;
 His own Son Jesus, crucified to take the blame
 For all the bad things I have done.
[V2]
 Thank You Jesus, thank You Lord,
 For loving me so much.
 I know I don't deserve anything.
 Help me feel Your love right now,
 To know deep in my heart
 That I'm Your special friend.
