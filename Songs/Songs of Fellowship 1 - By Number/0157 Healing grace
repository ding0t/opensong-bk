  <lyrics>
[C]
 Healing grace, healing grace,
 Show me more of Your healing grace.
 Fill my life anew as I worship You,
 For Your healing grace to me.
[V1]
 My eyes have been opened,
 And now I can see
 The love of the Father
 Given to me.
[V2]
 My Saviour, Deliverer,
 The reason I sing,
 To You I surrender,
 For You are my King.
