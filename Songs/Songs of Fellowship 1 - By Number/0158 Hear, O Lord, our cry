[V1]
 Hear, O Lord, our cry,
 Revive us, revive us again.
 For the sake of Your glory,
 Revive us, revive us again.
 Lord, hear our cry.
 Lord, hear our cry.
[V2]
 Hear, O Lord, our cry,
 Revive us, revive us again.
 For the sake of the children,
 Revive us, revive us again.
 Lord, hear our cry.
 Lord, hear our cry.
