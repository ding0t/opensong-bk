  <lyrics>
[V1]
 See Him lying on a bed of straw, 
 A draughty stable with an open door; 
 Mary cradling the babe she bore; 
 The Prince of glory is His name.
[C]
 O now carry me to Bethlehem, 
 To see the Lord appear to men; 
 Just as poor as was the stable then, 
 The Prince of glory when He came.
[V2]
 Star of silver, sweep across the skies, 
 Show where Jesus in the manger lies; 
 Shepherds, swiftly from your stupor rise 
 To see the Saviour of the world.
[V3]
 Angels, sing again the song you sang, 
 Bring God's glory to the heart of man; 
 Sing that Bethlehem's little baby can 
 Be salvation to the soul.
[V4]
 Mine are riches, from Thy poverty, 
 From Thine innocence, eternity; 
 Mine, forgiveness by Thy death for me, 
 Child of sorrow for my joy.
