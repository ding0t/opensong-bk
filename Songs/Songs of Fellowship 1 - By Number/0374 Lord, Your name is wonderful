  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, Your name is wonderful,
 At Your name the captives shall go free.
 We declare the mighty name of Jesus,
 And proclaim Your holy victory.
[V2]
 At Your name the kingdoms fall;
 We declare You Lord of all.
 At Your name the enemy shall flee,
 You are mighty,
 You are mighty Lord of all.
 Mighty Lord of all.
[V3]
 At Your name the kingdoms fall;
 We declare You Lord of all.
 At Your name the enemy shall flee,
 You are mighty,
 You are mighty Lord of all.
 Mighty Lord of all.
 Mighty Lord of all!
