[V1]
 He is our peace,
 Who has broken down every wall;
 He is our peace,
 He is our peace.
 He is our peace,
 Who has broken down every wall;
 He is our peace,
 He is our peace.
[V2]
 Cast all your cares on Him,
 For He cares for you;
 He is our peace,
 He is our peace.
 Cast all your cares on Him,
 For He cares for you;
 He is our peace,
 He is our peace.
