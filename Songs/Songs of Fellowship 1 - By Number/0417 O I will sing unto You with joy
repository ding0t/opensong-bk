[V1]
 O I will sing unto You with joy, O Lord,
 For You're the rock of my salvation, 
 Come before You with thanksgiving 
 And extol You with a song. 
 ||For You're the greatest King above all else, 
 You hold the depths of the earth in Your hand. 
 O I will sing unto You with joy, O Lord, 
 For You're the rock of my salvation.
