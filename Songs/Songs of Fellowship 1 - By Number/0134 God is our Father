  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God is our Father,
 For He has made us His own,
 Made Jesus our brother
 And hand in hand we'll grow together as one.
[V2]
 Sing praise to the Lord with the tambourine,
 Sing praise to the Lord with clapping hands,
 Sing praise to the Lord with dancing feet,
 Sing praise to the Lord with our voice.
[V3]
 La, la, la ... (etc.)
