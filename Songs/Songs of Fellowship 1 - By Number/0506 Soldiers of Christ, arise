[V1]
 Soldiers of Christ, arise, 
 And put your armour on; 
 Strong in the strength which God supplies, 
 Through His eternal Son;
[V2]
 Strong in the Lord of hosts, 
 And in His mighty power; 
 Who in the strength of Jesus trusts 
 Is more than conqueror.
[V3]
 Stand, then, in His great might,
 With all His strength endued;
 And take, to arm you for the fight,
 The panoply of God.
[V4]
 Leave no unguarded place, 
 No weakness of the soul; 
 Take every virtue, every grace, 
 And fortify the whole.
[V5]
 From strength to strength go on, 
 Wrestle and fight and pray; 
 Tread all the powers of darkness down, 
 And win the well-fought day.
[V6]
 That having all things done, 
 And all your conflicts past, 
 Ye may o'ercome, through Christ alone, 
 And stand complete at last.
