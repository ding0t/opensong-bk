[V1]
 Not without a cause do we go marching forth to war,
 Not without a cause that we'll see righteousness restored.
 Clean your weapons, stir your hearts, shed all fears before we start,
 When we stand to do our part we shall say:
[C]
 'Not without a right do we unsheath our silent swords,
 Not without a fight but we will crown Him Lord of Lords.
 Lift your banner, lift it high, Jesus is our battle cry.
 As we've lived, so we shall die, by His side.'
[V2]
 Not without a foe do we prepare ourselves to fight,
 Not without a shout will we scale hell's unconquered height.
 Let the hosts of Satan pray, when we rise as one that day,
 Let them run in disarray, when we say:
[V3]
 Not without a cheer will we hear bells and trumpets ring,
 Not without a tear we'll set Him on the throne of kings.
 Eyes on fire and faces grim, we will free Jerusalem,
 Through the gates we'll follow Him, as we say:
