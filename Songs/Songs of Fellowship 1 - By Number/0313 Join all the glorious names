[V1]
 Join all the glorious names
 Of wisdom, love, and power,
 That ever mortals knew,
 That angels ever bore:
 All are too mean to speak His worth,
 Too mean to set my Saviour forth.
[V2]
 Great Prophet of my God,
 My tongue would bless Thy name:
 By Thee the joyful news
 Of our salvation came:
 The joyful news of sins forgiven,
 Of hell subdued and peace with heaven.
[V3]
 Jesus, my great High Priest,
 Offered His blood, and died;
 My guilty conscience seeks
 No sacrifice beside:
 His powerful blood did once atone,
 And now it pleads before the throne.
[V4]
 My Saviour and my Lord,
 My Conqueror and my King,
 Thy sceptre and Thy sword,
 Thy reigning grace I sing:
 Thine is the power; behold, I sit
 In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.
[V5]
 Now let my soul arise,
 And tread the tempter down:
 My Captain leads me forth
 To conquest and a crown.
 March on, nor fear to win the day,
 Though death and hell obstruct the way.
[V6]
 Should all the hosts of death,
 And powers of hell unknown,
 Put their most dreadful forms
 Of rage and malice on,
 I shall be safe; for Christ displays
 Superior power and guardian grace.
