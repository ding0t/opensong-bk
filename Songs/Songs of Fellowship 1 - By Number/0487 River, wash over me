  <lyrics>
[V1]
 River, wash over me, 
 Cleanse me and make me new. 
 Bathe me, refresh me and fill me anew, 
 River wash over me.
[V2]
 Spirit, watch over me, 
 Lead me to Jesus' feet. 
 Cause me to worship and fill me anew, 
 Spirit, watch over me.
[V3]
 Jesus, rule over me, 
 Reign over all my heart. 
 Teach me to praise You and fill me anew, 
 Jesus, rule over me.
