  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I give you now all I have;
 I give to you My everything.
 You have the power inside of you
 To overcome all the hosts of darkness.
[V2]
 Go, go into the world,
 Tell them I'm alive,
 Go into the streets,
 Tell them that I live,
 Ooh, that I live in you.
[V3]
 Go, go into the world,
 Claim it for your King,
 Go into the streets,
 Dry those people's tears,
 Ooh, make the old things new.
