[V1]
 Jehovah Jireh, my provider,
 His grace is sufficient for me, for me, for me.
 Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
 His grace is sufficient for me.
[V2]
 My God shall supply all my needs
 According to His riches in glory;
 He will give His angels charge over me,
 Jehovah Jireh cares for me, for me, for me,
 Jehovah Jireh cares for me.
