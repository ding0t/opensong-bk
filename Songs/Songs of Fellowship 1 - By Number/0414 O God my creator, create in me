  <lyrics>
[V1]
 O God my creator, create in me 
 That river of water that flows full and free. 
 Let it bring life to the dead and stagnant sea; 
 Spring up, O well, and flow on out of me.
[C]
 We come to the throne 
 Where flows the living stream, 
 And drink from the water, 
 And drink from the water, 
 And drink from the water that flows from Thee.
[V2]
 O God my Creator, create in me 
 That new way of living that flows full and free. 
 Let it bring life to the wilderness of man; 
 Spring up, O well, and flood this thirsty land.
