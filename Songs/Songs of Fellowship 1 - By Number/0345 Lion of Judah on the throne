  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lion of Judah on the throne,
 I shout Your name, let it be known
 That You are the King of kings,
 You are the Prince of Peace,
 May Your kingdom's reign never cease.
 Hail to the King!
 Hail to the King!
[V2]
 Lion of Judah come to earth,
 I want to thank You for Your birth,
 For the living Word,
 For Your death on the tree,
 For Your resurrection victory.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Lion of Judah, come again,
 Take up Your throne Jerusalem,
 Bring release to this earth
 And the consummation
 Of Your kingdom's reign, let it come.
 Maranatha! Maranatha!
[V4]
 Lion of Judah on the throne,
 I shout Your name, let it be known
 That You are the King of kings,
 You are the Prince of Peace,
 May Your kingdom's reign never cease.
 Hail to the King!
 Hail to the King!
 You are my King!
