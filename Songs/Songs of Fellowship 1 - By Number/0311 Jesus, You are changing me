[V1]
 Jesus, You are changing me,
 By Your Spirit You're making me like You.
 Jesus, You're transforming me,
 That Your loveliness may be seen in all I do.
[V2]
 You are the potter and I am the clay,
 Help me to be willing to let You have Your way.
 Jesus, You are changing me,
 As I let You reign supreme within my heart.
