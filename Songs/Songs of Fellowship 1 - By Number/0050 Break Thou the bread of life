  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Break Thou the bread of life,
 Dear Lord, to me,
 As Thou didst break the bread
 Beside the sea;
 Beyond the sacred page
 I seek Thee, Lord;
 My spirit longs for Thee,
 Thou Living Word.
[V2]
 Thou art the Bread of Life,
 O Lord, to me,
 Thy holy Word the truth
 That saveth me;
 Give me to eat and live
 With Thee above;
 Teach me to love Thy truth,
 For Thou art love.
[V3]
 O send Thy Spirit, Lord,
 Now unto me,
 That He may touch my eyes
 And make me see;
 Show me the truth concealed
 Within Thy Word,
 And in Thy Book revealed,
 I see Thee, Lord.
[V4]
 Bless Thou the Bread of Life
 To me, to me,
 As Thou didst bless the loaves
 By Galilee;
 Then shall all bondage cease,
 All fetters fall,
 And I shall find my peace,
 My all in all.
