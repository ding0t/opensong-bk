  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lift up your heads, O you gates,
 Swing wide you everlasting doors.
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
 Swing wide you everlasting doors.
[C]
 That the King of glory may come in,
 That the King of glory may come in.
 That the King of glory may come in,
 That the King of glory may come in.
[V2]
 Up from the dead He ascends,
 Through every rank of heavenly power.
 Let heaven prepare the highest place,
 Throw wide the everlasting doors:
[V3]
 With trumpet blast and shouts of joy,
 All heaven greets the risen King.
 With angel choirs come line the way,
 Throw wide the gates and welcome Him.
