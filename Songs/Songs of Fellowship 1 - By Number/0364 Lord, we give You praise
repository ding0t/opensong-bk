  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, we give You praise;
 Our prayer of thanks to You we bring.
 We sing our songs to You,
 For praise belongs to You;
 Lord, we give You praise.
[V2]
 Your love goes on and on;
 You never change, You never turn.
 Our hands we raise to You,
 And bring our praise to You;
 Lord, we give You praise.
