  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Seek ye first the kingdom of God 
 And His righteousness, 
 And all these things shall be added unto you, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
[C]
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah! Hallelu, hallelujah!
[V2]
 Man shall not live by bread alone, 
 But by every word 
 That proceeds from the mouth of God, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
[V3]
 Ask and it shall be given unto you, 
 Seek and ye shall find. 
 Knock and it shall be opened unto you, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
[V4]
 If the Son shall set you free, 
 Ye shall be free indeed. 
 Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
[V5]
 Let your light so shine before men 
 That they may see your good works 
 And glorify your Father in heaven, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
[V6]
 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, 
 He shall direct thy paths, 
 In all thy ways acknowledge Him, 
 Hallelu, hallelujah!
