  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Make me a channel of Your peace.
 Where there is hatred let me bring Your love;
 Where there is injury, Your pardon, Lord;
 And where there's doubt, true faith in You.
[C]
 Oh, Master, grant that I may never seek
 So much to be consoled as to console;
 To be understood as to understand;
 To be loved as to love with all my soul.
[V2]
 Make me a channel of Your peace.
 Where there's despair in life let me bring hope;
 Where there is darkness, only light;
 And where there's sadness, ever joy.
[V3]
 Make me a channel of Your peace.
 It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
 In giving to all men that we receive,
 And in dying that we're born to eternal life.
