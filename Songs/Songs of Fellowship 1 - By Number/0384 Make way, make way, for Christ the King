[V1]
 Make way, make way, for Christ the King
 In splendour arrives.
 Fling wide the gates and welcome Him
 Into your lives.
[C]
 Make way! (Make way!)
 Make way! (Make way!)
 For the King of kings.
 (For the King of kings.)
 Make way! (Make way!)
 Make way! (Make way!)
 And let His kingdom in.
[V2]
 He comes the broken hearts to heal,
 The prisoners to free.
 The deaf shall hear, the lame shall dance,
 The blind shall see.
[V3]
 And those who mourn with heavy hearts,
 Who weep and sigh;
 With laughter, joy and royal crown
 He'll beautify.
[V4]
 We call you now to worship Him
 As Lord of all.
 To have no Gods before Him,
 Their thrones must fall!
