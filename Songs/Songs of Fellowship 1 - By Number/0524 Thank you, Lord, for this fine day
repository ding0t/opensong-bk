[V1]
 Thank you, Lord, for this fine day, 
 Thank You, Lord, for this fine day, 
 Thank You, Lord, for this fine day, 
 Right where we are.
[C]
 Alleluia, praise the Lord! 
 Alleluia, praise the Lord! 
 Alleluia, praise the Lord,
 Right where we are.
[V2]
 Thank You, Lord, for loving us,
 Thank You, Lord, for loving us,
 Thank You, Lord, for loving us,
 Right where we are.
[V3]
 Thank You, Lord, for giving us peace,
 Thank You, Lord, for giving us peace,
 Thank You, Lord, for giving us peace,
 Right where we are.
[V4]
 Thank You, Lord, for setting us free,
 Thank You, Lord, for setting us free,
 Thank You, Lord, for setting us free,
 Right where we are.
