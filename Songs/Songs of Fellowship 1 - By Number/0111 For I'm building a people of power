  <lyrics>
[V1]
 For I'm building a people of power,
 And I'm making a people of praise
 That will move through this land by My Spirit,
 And will glorify My precious name.
[C]
 Build Your church, Lord,
 Make us strong, Lord,
 Join our hearts, Lord, through Your Son.
 Make us one, Lord,
 In Your Body,
 In the kingdom of Your Son.
