  <lyrics>
[V1]
 He was pierced for our transgressions,
 And bruised for our iniquities;
 And to bring us peace He was punished,
 And by His stripes we are healed.
[V2]
 He was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
 Although He was innocent of crime;
 And cut off from the land of the living,
 He paid for the guilt that was mine.
[C]
 We like sheep have gone astray,
 Turned each one to his own way,
 And the Lord has laid on Him
 The iniquity of us all.
