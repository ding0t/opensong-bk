[V1]
 I lift my hands,
 I raise my voice,
 I give my heart to You, my Lord,
 And I rejoice.
 ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do,
 O, but most of all I praise You,
 Most of all I praise You,
 Jesus, most of all I praise You because You're You.
[V2]
 I lift my hands,
 I raise my voice,
 I give my life to You, my Lord,
 And I rejoice.
 ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do,
 O, but most of all I love You,
 Most of all I love You,
 Jesus, most of all I love You because You're You.
[V3]
 I lift my hands,
 I raise my voice,
 I give my love to You, my Lord,
 And I rejoice.
 ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do,
 O, but most of all I love You,
 Most of all I love You,
 Jesus, most of all I love You because You're You.
