[V1]
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Move among us with holy fire,
 As we lay aside all earthly desires,
 Hands reach out and our hearts aspire.
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
[V2]
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Let the breeze of Your presence blow,
 That Your children here might truly know
 How to move in the Spirit's flow.
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
[V3]
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
 Please accomplish in me today
 Some new work of loving grace, I pray;
 Unreservedly have Your way.
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
 Holy Spirit, we welcome You.
