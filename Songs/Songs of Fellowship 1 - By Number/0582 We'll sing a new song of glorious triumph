[V1]
 We'll sing a new song of glorious triumph,
 For we see the government of God in our lives.
 We'll sing a new song of glorious triumph,
 For we see the government of God in our lives.
[V2]
 He is crowned, God of the whole world crowned,
 King of creation crowned,
 Ruling the nations now.
 Yes, He is crowned, God of the whole world crowned,
 King of creation crowned,
 Ruling the nations now.
