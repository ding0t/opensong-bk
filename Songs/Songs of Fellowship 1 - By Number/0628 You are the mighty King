  <lyrics>
[V1]
 You are the mighty king,
 The living Word;
 Master of everything,
 You are the Lord.
[C1]
 And I praise Your name, 
 And I praise Your name.
[V2]
 You are Almighty God, 
 Saviour and Lord; 
 Wonderful Counsellor, 
 You are the Lord.
[V3]
 You are the Prince of Peace, 
 Emmanuel; 
 Everlasting Father, 
 You are the Lord.
[C2]
 And I love Your name, 
 And I love Your name.
[V4]
 You are the Mighty King, 
 The living Word; 
 Master of everything, 
 You are the Lord.
