[V1]
 I delight greatly in the Lord,
 My soul rejoices in my God.
 I delight greatly in the Lord,
 My soul rejoices in my God.
[V2]
 For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
 And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness.
 He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
 And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness.
