  <lyrics> 
[V1]
 From heaven You came,
 Helpless babe,
 Entered our world,
 Your glory veiled;
 Not to be served
 But to serve,
 And give Your life
 That we might live.
[C]
 This is our God,
 The Servant King,
 He calls us now
 to follow Him,
 To bring our lives
 as a daily offering
 Of worship to
 the Servant King.
[V2]
 There in the garden
 Of tears,
 My heavy load
 He chose to bear;
 His heart with sorrow
 Was torn,
 'Yet not My will
 But Yours,' He said.
[V3]
 Come see His hands
 And His feet,
 The scars that speak
 Of sacrifice;
 Hands that flung stars
 Into space
 To cruel nails
 Surrendered.
[V4]
 So let us learn
 How to serve,
 And in our lives
 Enthrone Him;
 Each other's needs
 To prefer,
 For it is Christ
 We're serving.
