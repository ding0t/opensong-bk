  <lyrics>
[C]
 Light a flame within my heart
 That's burning bright;
 Fan the fire of joy in me
 To set the world alight.
 Let my flame begin to spread,
 My life to glow;
 God of light may I reflect
 Your love to all I know.
[V1]
 From heaven's splendour
 He comes to earth,
 While all the angels celebrate
 The goodness of His birth.
[V2]
 We too exalt You,
 Our glorious King;
 Jesus our Saviour
 Paid the price to take away our sin.
