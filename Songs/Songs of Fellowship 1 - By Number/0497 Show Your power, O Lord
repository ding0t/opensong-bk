  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Show Your power, O Lord, 
 Demonstrate the justice of Your kingdom. 
 Prove Your mighty word. 
 Vindicate Your name 
 Before a watching world. 
 ||Awesome are Your deeds, O Lord; 
 Renew them for this hour. 
 Show Your power, O Lord, 
 Among the people now.
[V2]
 Show Your power, O Lord, 
 Cause Your church to rise and take action. 
 Let all fear be gone, 
 Powers of the age to come 
 Are breaking through. 
 ||We Your people are ready to serve, 
 To arise and to obey. 
 Show Your power, O Lord, 
 And set the people free.
