  <lyrics>
[V1]
 We are here to praise You,
 Lift our hearts and sing.
 We are here to give You
 The best that we can bring.
[V2]
 And it is our love
 Rising from our hearts,
 Everything within us cries:
 'Abba Father.'
 Help us now to give You
 Pleasure and delight,
 Heart and mind and will that say:
 'I love You Lord.'
