[V1]
 Jesus, king of kings,
 We worship and adore You.
 Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth,
 We bow down at Your feet.
 Father, we bring to You our worship;
 Your sovereign will be done,
 On earth Your kingdom come,
 Through Jesus Christ, Your only Son.
[V2]
 Jesus, Sovereign Lord,
 We worship and adore You.
 Jesus, Name above all names,
 We bow down at Your feet.
 Father, we offer You our worship;
 Your sovereign will be done,
 On earth Your kingdom come,
 Through Jesus Christ, Your only Son.
[V3]
 Jesus, Light of the world,
 We worship and adore You.
 Jesus, Lord Emmanuel,
 We bow down at Your feet.
 Father, for Your delight we worship;
 Your sovereign will be done,
 On earth Your kingdom come,
 Through Jesus Christ, Your only Son.
