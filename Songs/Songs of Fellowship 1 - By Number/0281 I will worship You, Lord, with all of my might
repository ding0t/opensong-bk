[V1]
 I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might,
 I will praise You with a psalm.
 I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might,
 I will praise You all day long.
[V2]
 For Thou, O Lord, art glorious,
 And Thy name is greatly to be praised;
 May my heart be pure and holy in Thy sight,
 As I worship You with all of my might.
