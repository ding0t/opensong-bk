  <lyrics>
[V1]
 God of glory, we exalt Your name,
 You who reign in majesty.
 We lift our hearts to You
 And we will worship, praise and magnify
 Your holy name.
[V2]
 In power resplendent
 You reign in glory,
 Eternal King, You reign forever.
 Your word is mighty,
 Releasing captives,
 Your love is gracious,
 You are my God.
