[V1]
 Rejoice, the Lord is king! 
 Your Lord and King adore; 
 Mortals, give thanks, and sing, 
 And triumph ever more:
[C1]
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
 Rejoice! Again I say: rejoice!
[V2]
 Jesus the Saviour reigns, 
 The God of truth and love;
 When He had purged our stains, 
 He took His seat above:
[V3]
 His kingdom cannot fail, 
 He rules o'er earth and heaven; 
 The keys of death and hell 
 Are to our Jesus given:
[V4]
 He sits at God's right hand 
 Till all His foes submit, 
 And bow to His command, 
 And fall beneath His feet:
[V5]
 Rejoice in glorious hope; 
 Jesus the Judge shall come, 
 And take His servants up 
 To their eternal home:
[C2]
 We soon shall hear the archangel's voice;
 The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!
