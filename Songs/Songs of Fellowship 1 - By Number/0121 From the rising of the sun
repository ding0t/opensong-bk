[V1]
 From the rising of the sun
 To the going down of the same,
 The Lord's name
 Is to be praised.
 From the rising of the sun
 To the going down of the same
 The Lord's name
 Is to be praised.
[C]
 Praise ye the Lord,
 Praise Him all ye servants of the Lord,
 Praise the name of the Lord.
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 From this time forth and forever more.
