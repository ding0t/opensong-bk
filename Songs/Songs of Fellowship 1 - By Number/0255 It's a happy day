[V1]
 It's a happy day, and I thank God for the weather.
 It's a happy day, living it for my Lord.
 It's a happy day, things are gonna get better,
 Living each day by the promises in God's word.
[V2]
 It's a grumpy day, and I can't stand the weather.
 It's a grumpy day, living it for myself.
 It's a grumpy day, and things aren't gonna get better
 Living each day with my Bible up on my shelf.
