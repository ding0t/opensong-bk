  <lyrics>
[V1]
 I will give thanks to Thee,
 O Lord, among the people,
 I will sing praises to Thee
 Among the nations.
 For Thy steadfast love is great,
 Is great to the heavens,
 And Thy faithfulness,
 Thy faithfulness to the clouds.
[V2]
 Be exalted, O God,
 Above the heavens.
 Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
 Be exalted, O God,
 Above the heavens.
 Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
[V3]
 Be exalted, O God,
 Above the heavens.
 Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
 Be exalted, O God,
 Above the heavens.
 Let Thy glory, let Thy glory,
 Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
