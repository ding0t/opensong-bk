  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return
 And come with singing unto Zion,
 And everlasting joy shall be upon their head.
 (Repeat)
[V2]
 They shall obtain gladness and joy,
 And sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
[V3]
 Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return
 And come with singing unto Zion,
 And everlasting joy shall be upon their head.
