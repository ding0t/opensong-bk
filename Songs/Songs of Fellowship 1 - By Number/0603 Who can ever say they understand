[V1]
 Who can ever say they understand 
 All the wonders of His master plan? 
 Christ came down and gave Himself toman 
 Forever more.
[V2]
 He was Lord before all time began,
 Yet made Himself the sacrificial lamb,
 Perfect love now reconciled to man
 Forever more.
[C]
 Forever more we'll sing the story 
 Of love come down.
 Forever more the King of glory 
 We will crown.
[V3]
 He is coming back to earth again, 
 Every knee shall bow before His name, 
 'Christ is Lord', let thankful hearts proclaim 
 Forever more.
