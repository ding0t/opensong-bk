[C]
 We will honour You, we will honour You,
 We will exalt the Holy One of Israel.
 We will honour You, yes, we will honour You,
 We will enthrone You in our praise.
[V1]
 You are the Alpha and Omega;
 You are the beginning and the end.
 There is no other we can turn to,
 No other rock on which we can depend.
[V2]
 You will not share Your praise with idols;
 All glory belongs to You alone.
 Who in the skies can be compared with
 The Lord Almighty Father God and King?
[V3]
 All of the earth will bow before You;
 They will be left no place to hide.
 No longer Satan's rule of darkness,
 But the name of Jesus ever glorified.
