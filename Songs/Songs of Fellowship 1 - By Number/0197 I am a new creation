[C]
 I am a new creation,
 No more in condemnation,
 Here in the grace of God I stand.
 My heart is overflowing,
 My love just keeps on growing,
 Here in the grace of God I stand.
[V1]
 And I will praise You Lord,
 Yes, I will praise You Lord,
 And I will sing of all that You have done.
[V2]
 A joy that knows no limit,
 A lightness in my spirit,
 Here in the grace of God I stand.
