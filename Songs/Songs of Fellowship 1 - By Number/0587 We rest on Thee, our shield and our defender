[V1]
 We rest on Thee, our shield and our defender!
 We go not forth alone against the foe;
 Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
 We rest on Thee and in Thy name we go.
 ||Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
 We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.
[V2]
 Yes, in Thy name, O Captain of salvation!
 In Thy dear name, all other names above,
 Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
 Our Prince of glory and our King of love.
 ||Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
 Our Prince of glory and our King of love.
[V3]
 We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,
 And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
 Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
 We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.
 ||Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
 We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.
[V4]
 We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!
 Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise;
 When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,
 Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.
 ||When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,
 Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.
