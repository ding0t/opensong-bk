  <lyrics>
[V1]
 In the tomb so cold they laid him,
 Death its victim claimed.
 Powers of hell, they could not hold Him;
 Back to life He came!
[C]
 Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!)
 Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.)
 Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!)
 He shall reign for ever.
[V2]
 Hell had spent its fury on Him,
 Left Him crucified.
 Yet, by blood, He boldly conquered,
 Sin and death defied.
[V3]
 Now the fear of death is broken,
 Love has won the crown.
 Prisoners of the darkness listen,
 Walls are tumbling down.
[V4]
 Raised from death to heaven ascending,
 Love's exalted King.
 Let His song of joy, unending,
 Through the nations ring!
