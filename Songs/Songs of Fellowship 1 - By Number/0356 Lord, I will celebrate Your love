  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Lord, I will celebrate Your love,
 From deep within my heart,
 I celebrate Your love;
 I celebrate Your love given to me.
[V2]
 You are the one that I adore;
 Lord, in Your presence is life forever more;
 The one that I adore.
 You are my Lord.
[V3]
 Healing me, releasing me,
 More and more reveal Yourself in me,
 My Lord, my Lord!
