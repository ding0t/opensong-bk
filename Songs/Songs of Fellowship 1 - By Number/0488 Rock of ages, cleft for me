[V1]
 Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee; 
 Let the water and the blood, 
 From Thy riven side which flowed, 
 Be of sin the double cure, 
 Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
[V2]
 Not the labour of my hands 
 Can fulfil Thy law's demands; 
 Could my zeal no respite know, 
 Could my tears forever flow, 
 All for sin could not atone: 
 Thou must save, and Thou alone.
[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring, 
 Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
 Naked, come to Thee for dress; 
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace; 
 Foul, I to the fountain fly: 
 Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath, 
 When mine eyes shall close in death, 
 When I soar to worlds unknown, 
 See Thee on Thy judgement throne, 
 Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee.
