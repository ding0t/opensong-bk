[V1]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
 Early in the morning
 Our song shall rise to Thee:
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
[V2]
 Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,
 Casting down their golden crowns
 Around the glassy sea;
 Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
 Who were, and are, and ever more shall be.
[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
 Though the eye of sinful man
 Thy glory may not see;
 Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
 Perfect in power, in love and purity.
[V4]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name
 In earth, and sky, and sea;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
