[V1]
 Let us with a gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V2]
 Let us blaze His name abroad,
 For of Gods He is the God:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V3]
 He, with all-commanding might,
 Filled the new-made world with light:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V4]
 He the golden-tressed sun
 Caused all day his course to run:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V5]
 And the silver moon by night,
 'Mid her spangled sisters bright:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V6]
 He His chosen race did bless
 In the wasteful wilderness:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V7]
 All things living He doth feed,
 His full hand supplies their need:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V8]
 Let us with a gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind: 
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
