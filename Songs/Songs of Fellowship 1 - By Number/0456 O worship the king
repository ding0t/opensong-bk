[V1]
 O worship the king, 
 All glorious above; 
 O gratefully sing 
 His power and His love: 
 Our Shield and Defender, 
 The Ancient of Days, 
 Pavilioned in splendour 
 And girded with praise.
[V2]
 O tell of His might, 
 O sing of His grace, 
 Whose robe is the light, 
 Whose canopy space; 
 His chariots of wrath 
 The deep thunder-clouds form, 
 And dark is His path 
 On the wings of the storm.
[V3]
 The earth, with its store 
 Of wonders untold, 
 Almighty, Thy power 
 Hath founded of old; 
 Hath 'stablished it fast, 
 By a changeless decree, 
 And round it hath cast, 
 Like a mantle, the sea.
[V4]
 Thy bountiful care 
 What tongue can recite? 
 It breathes in the air, 
 It shines in the light; 
 It streams from the hills, 
 It descends to the plain, 
 And sweetly distils 
 In the dew and the rain.
[V5]
 Frail children of dust, 
 And feeble as frail, 
 In Thee do we trust, 
 Nor find Thee to fail; 
 Thy mercies how tender, 
 How firm to the end, 
 Our Maker, Defender, 
 Redeemer, and Friend!
