[V1]
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 All the angels cry out holy;
 All the angels exalt Your name,
 Crying holy, holy, holy,
 Holy is the Lord.
[V2]
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 All Your people cry out holy;
 All Your people exalt Your name,
 Crying holy, holy, holy,
 Holy is the Lord.
[V3]
 Glory, glory, glory to the Lord GodAlmighty.
 Glory, glory, glory to the Lord GodAlmighty.
 The whole earth is filled with Your glory;
 The whole earth will exalt Your name,
 Crying holy, holy, holy,
 Holy is the Lord.
