[V1]
 Praise him, praise him, 
 Praise Him with your song. 
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Praise Him all day long!
[C]
 For the Lord is worthy, 
 Worthy to receive our praise. 
 For the Lord is worthy, 
 Worthy to receive our praise.
[V2]
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Praise Him with your heart. 
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Give Him all you are.
[V3]
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Praise Him with your life. 
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Lift His name up high.
