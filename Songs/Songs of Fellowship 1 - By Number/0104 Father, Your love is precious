[V1]
 Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
 Father, Your love overwhelms me.
 Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
 Father, Your love overwhelms me.
[V2]
 So I lift up my hands, an expression of my love,
 And I give You my heart in joyful obedience.
 Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
 Father, Your love overwhelms me.
