  <lyrics>
[C]
 I will seek Your face, O Lord;
 I will seek Your face, O Lord.
 I will seek Your face, O Lord;
 I will seek Your face, O Lord.
[V1]
 Lord, how awesome is Your presence;
 Who can stand in Your light?
 Those who by Your grace and mercy
 Are made holy in Your sight.
[V2]
 I will dwell in Your presence
 All the days of my life;
 There to gaze upon Your glory,
 And to worship only You.
