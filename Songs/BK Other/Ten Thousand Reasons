  <lyrics>[c]
 Bless the Lord, o my soul, oh my soul
 Worship his holy name
 Sing like never before, o my soul
 I'll worship your holy name
 
[v1]
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning 
 It's time to sing your song again
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
 Let me be singing when the evening comes
 
 
[v2]
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
 Your name is great and Your heart is kind
 For all your goodness I will keep on singing
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
 
[v3]
 And on that day when my strength is failing
 The end draws near and my time has come
 Still my soul will sing your praise unending
 Ten thousand years and then forevermore </lyrics>
