  <lyrics>[V1] 
 We plough the fields and scatter 
 The good seed on the land, 
 But it is fed and watered 
 By God's almighty hand: 
 He sends the snow in winter, 
 The warmth to swell the grain, 
 The breezes and the sunshine, 
 And soft, refreshing rain.  
 
[C]
 All good gifts around us 
 Are sent from heaven above; 
 Then thank the Lord, 
 O thank the Lord, 
 For all his love.  
 
[V2] 
 He only is the maker 
 Of all things near and far; 
 He paints the wayside flower, 
 He lights the evening star; 
 The winds and waves obey him, 
 By him the birds are fed; 
 Much more to us, his children, 
 He gives our daily bread. 
 
[V3]
 We thank thee then, O Father, 
 For all things bright and good,
 The seed time and the harvest, 
 Our life, our health, our food. 
 Accept the gifts we offer 
 For all thy love imparts, 
 And what thou most desirest, 
 Our humble, thankful hearts.
