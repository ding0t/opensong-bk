 He became sin
 Who knew no sin
 That we might become His Righteousness
 He humbled himself and carried the cro-ss
 Love so amazing

 Jesus Messiah 
 Name above all names
 Blessed redeemer
 Emanuel 
 The rescue for sinners
 The ransom from from heaven
 Jesus Messiah
 Lord of all

 His body the bread 
 His blood the wine 
 Broken and poured out all for love
 The whole earth trembeled and the veil was to-rn
 Love so amazing
 Love so amazing

 All our hope is in you
 All the glory to you,God
 The light of the world</lyrics>
