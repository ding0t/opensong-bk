  <lyrics>[V1]
 Far and near
 Hear the call 
 worship Him
 Lord of all
 Families
 of nations come
 Celebrate
 What God has done
[C]
 Say it loud,  say it strong 
 tell the world  what God has done
 say it loud,  praise His name
 let the Earth rejoice  the Lord reigns
[V2]
 Deep and wide
 is the love
 heaven sent
 from above
 God's own son
 for sinners died
 rose again
 He is alive
[V3]
 At His name
 let praise begin
 oceans roar
 nature sings
 for He comes
 to judge the Earth
 in righteousness
 and in His truth
 </lyrics></song>
