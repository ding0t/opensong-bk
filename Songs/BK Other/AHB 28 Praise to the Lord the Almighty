  <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,   
 the King of creation!
 O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy   
 health and salvation!     
 All ye who hear, 
 Now to His temple draw near; 
 Sing now in glad adoration!
 
[V2]
 Praise to the Lord, who o'er all   
 things so wondrously reigneth, 
 Who, as on wings of an eagle,   
 uplifteth, sustaineth.     
 Hast thou not seen 
 How thy desires all have been 
 Granted in what He ordaineth?
 
[V3]
 Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully,   
 wondrously, made thee! 
 Health hath vouchsafed and, when   
 heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.     
 What need or grief 
 Ever hath failed of relief? 
 Wings of His mercy did shade thee.
 
[V4]
 Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper   
 thy work and defend thee, 
 Who from the heavens the streams of   
 His mercy doth send thee.     
 Ponder anew What the Almighty can do, 
 Who with His love doth befriend thee.
 
[V5]
 Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that   
 is in me adore Him! 
 All that hath life and breath, come   
 now with praises before Him!     
 Let the Amen 
 Sound from His people again; 
 Gladly for aye we adore Him.
