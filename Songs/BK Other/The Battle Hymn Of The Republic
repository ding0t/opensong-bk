  <lyrics>[v1]
 Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,
 He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
 he has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword,
 His truth is marching on.
[c]
 Glory,glory hallelujah, glory,glory, hallelujah,
 Glory,glory hallelujah, His truth is marching on.
[v4]
 In a humble stable Christ was born across the sea,
 with glory from the Father that transfigures you and me,
 As He died to make men holy, He has died to make men free,
 His truth is marching on.</lyrics></song>
