  <lyrics>[C]
 Amen, praise the Lord.  
 Amen, praise the Lord.
 Glory hallelujah, praise the Lord
 I'm gonna jump down, turn around, touch the ground and priase my Lord.

[V1]
 I am the way, the truth and the life.  
 I am the way, the truth and the life,
 No man cometh unto the Father but by Me,
 I'm gonna jump down, turn around, touch the ground and praise my Lord.

[V2]
 Marvel not, you must be born again,
 Marvel not, you must be born again,
 Marvel not, you must be born again,
 I'm gonna jump down turn around touch the ground and praise my Lord.

[V3]
 Suffer ye the little children to come unto me,
 Suffer ye the little children to come unto me
 And forbid them not for such is the kingdom of heaven,
 I'm gonna jump down, turn around, touch the ground and praise my Lord.
