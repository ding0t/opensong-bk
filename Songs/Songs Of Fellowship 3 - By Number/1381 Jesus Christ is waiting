[V1]
 Jesus Christ is waiting, waiting in the streets;
 No one is His neighbour, all alone He eats.
 Listen, Lord Jesus, I am lonely too:
 Make me, friend or stranger, fit to wait on You.
 
[V2]
 Jesus Christ is raging, raging in the streets,
 Where injustice spirals and real hope retreats.
 Listen, Lord Jesus, I am angry too:
 In the kingdom's causes, let me rage with You.
 
[V3]
 Jesus Christ is healing, healing in the streets,
 Curing those who suffer, touching those He greets.
 Listen, Lord Jesus, I have pity too:
 Let my care be active, healing just like You.
 
[V4]
 Jesus Christ is dancing, dancing in the streets,
 Where each sign of hatred He, with love, defeats.
 Listen, Lord Jesus, I should triumph too:
 Where good conquers evil, let me dance with You.
 
[V5]
 Jesus Christ is calling, calling in the streets:
 'Who will join My journey? I will guide their feet.'
 Listen, Lord Jesus, let my fears be few:
 Walk one step before me; I will follow You.
