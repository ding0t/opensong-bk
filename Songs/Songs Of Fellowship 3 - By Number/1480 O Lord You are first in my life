[V1]
 O Lord, You are first in my life;
 For You I live as a sacrifice,
 Holy in Your sight, pleasing to Your heart,
 As I put my trust in You.
 
[V2]
 Precious Jesus, You paid such a cost,
 That I may know Your love, 
 Your grace, Your touch;
 With everything I am,
 I want to know You more,
 My heart is open to You.
 
[V3]
 As I seek You, Lord, 
 You draw me nearer.
 
[C]
 I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours,
 Completely abandoned to You.
 I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours,
 Wholly devoted to You.
