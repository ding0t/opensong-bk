[V1]
 I'm drawn a little bit closer to You,
 Hearing You whisper to me;
 A little bit nearer to You,
 Hearing the beat of Your heart.
 Sensing Your power at work,
 Seeing the need in Your world:
 A little bit closer to You.
 
[V2]
 As I see Your faithfulness,
 As I fix my eyes on You, O Lord;
 As I run the race You've run,
 Every day, every day.
