[V1]
 Create in me the purest of hearts,
 According to Your unfailing love.
 Renew a steadfast spirit within
 And wash away my sin.
 And make me like the snow,
 But even whiter still.
 
[C]
 I just want to have a pure heart,
 I just want to have a pure, pure heart.
 I just want to have a pure heart,
 I just want to have a pure, pure heart.
 
[V2]
 I'm clay within the Potter's hand
 Where tenderness meets discipline.
 I need it all, Lord, come and form
 Your holiness in me.
 And make me like the snow,
 But even whiter still.
