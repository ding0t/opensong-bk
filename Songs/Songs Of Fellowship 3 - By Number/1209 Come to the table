[V1]
 Come to the table,
 Drink from His cup;
 Come to the table,
 You can never get enough
 Of His love for you,
 Of His love for you.
 Oh, such precious love.
 Oh, such precious love.
 
[V2]
 Turn your face to Him.
 Let the feast begin.
 With the angels sing:
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah to the Lord.
 
[V3]
 We will come to the table,
 Drink from Your cup;
 Come to the table,
 We can never get enough
 Of the love You give,
 Of the love You give.
 Oh, such precious love.
 Oh, such precious love.
