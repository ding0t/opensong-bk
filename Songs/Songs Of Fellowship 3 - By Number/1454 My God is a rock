[V1]
 My God is a rock! My feet are planted 
 And I'm not gonna stop praising.
 This love is alive!
 Goodness and mercy all the days of my life.
 
[V2]
 My God is a Rock who can't be shaken, 
 No, I won't ever stop praising.
 This love is alive
 With every promise written over my life.
 
[C]
 And in Him I live, for He lives in me.
 And in Him I move, and I have my being.
 I'm held forever in Your hand 
 (Rock solid, rock solid).
 And now this ground on which I stand 
 (Is rock solid, it's rock solid).
 
[V3]
 My God is a Rock and my salvation,
 That's why I'll never stop praising.
 This love is alive! 
 My strength and shelter all the days of my life.
 
[V4]
 My God is a Rock who never changes,
 How can I ever stop praising?
 This love is alive! 
 Night and day He's watching over my life.
