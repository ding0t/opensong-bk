[V1]
 Many are the words we speak,
 Many are the songs we sing; 
 Many kinds of offerings, 
 But now to live the life. 
 (Repeat)
 
[C]
 Help us live the life, 
 Help us live the life. 
 All we want to do 
 Is bring You something real, 
 Bring You something true. 
 
[V2]
 (We hope that) 
 Precious are the words we speak,
 (We pray that) 
 Precious are the songs we sing;
 Precious all these offerings, 
 But now to live the life.
 
[V3]
 Now to go the extra mile, 
 Now to turn the other cheek, 
 And to serve You with a life. 
 Let us share Your fellowship, 
 Even of Your sufferings;
 Never let the passion die. 
 
[V4]
 Now to live the life.
 Now to live the life.
 Now to live the life.
 Now to live the life.
 Now to live the life.
 Now to live the life.
