[C]
 God is good all the time!
 He put a song of praise in this heart of mine.
 God is good all the time!
 Through the darkest night
 His light will shine:
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 
[V1]
 If you're walking through the valley
 And there are shadows all around,
 Do not fear, He will guide you,
 He will keep you safe and sound;
 'Cause He has promised to never leave you
 Nor forsake you, and His word is true.
 
[V2]
 We were sinners, so unworthy,
 Still for us He chose to die:
 Filled us with His Holy Spirit,
 Now we can stand and testify
 That His love is everlasting
 And His mercies, they will never end.
 
[V3]
 Though I may not understand
 All the plans You have for me,
 My life is in Your hands,
 And through the eyes of faith 
 I can clearly see:
