[V1]
 Good and gracious, 
 Attributes of a loving Father,
 You're high and mighty, 
 But humble all the same.
 You have made the heavens and the earth,
 And You made us in Your image, Lord.
 
[C]
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, 
 And we rejoice in You alone, 
 For You are worthy.
 And You have given life to me,
 And I love to worship at Your feet,
 And I love to love You just for who You are.
 
[V2]
 Death and hell are 
 Now no longer things I fear because
 You have saved me 
 And I'm grateful to the core.
 I'm Your child because of Jesus' blood,
 And Your Spirit leads me, 
 Guides me, fills me.
 
[V3]
 I'm so grateful for the things 
 You have given me:
 Your love, Your grace, Your joy, 
 Your peace and more.
 Holy, holy. 
 Holy, holy.
