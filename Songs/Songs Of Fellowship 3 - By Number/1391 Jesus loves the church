[V1]
 Jesus loves the church, 
 He gave Himself for His bride. 
 He knows what we will be, 
 A conquering army, 
 An unblemished people.
 We're accepted, we're forgiven, 
 We're united with Him; 
 Not rejected, not forgotten, 
 Not abandoned in sin. 
 
[C]
 Can you hear Him singing, 
 'I love you, I love you'? 
 Can you hear Him calling, 
 'I want you, I have chosen you to be Mine'?
 
[V2]
 Jesus loves the church,
 His passion through the ages.
 Hell will not prevail.
 He builds us together,
 A living temple.
 We're accepted, we're forgiven,
 We're united with Him;
 Not rejected, not forgotten,
 Not abandoned in sin.
