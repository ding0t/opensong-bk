[V1]
 You are my King, I live to know You.
 Oh, to walk in the fullness of Your Spirit.
 I'll abide in You and You in me,
 I'll see Your desire fulfilled within me.
 
[C]
 I am changed by You
 Into Your image.
 I am changed by You,
 I become the same.
 I am changed by You,
 Like my Father God,
 King of heaven.
 King of heaven.
 
[V2]
 You placed in me a fire when I met You,
 And the flame, it just burns brighter and brighter.
 I'm coming after You with all that's in me,
 I need You more and more each time I wake.
 
[V3]
 Glory to glory to glory, Lord,
 We will never be the same.
 Glory to glory to glory, Lord,
 Oh, we will never, never be the same.
