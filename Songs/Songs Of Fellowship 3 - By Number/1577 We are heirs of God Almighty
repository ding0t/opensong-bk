[V1]
 We are heirs of God Almighty,
 Apple of the Father's eye;
 Free, forgiven, loved, accepted,
 Clothed in righteousness divine.
 Chosen to be pure and blameless
 From before the world began;
 Grace for every situation,
 Sheltered in the Father's hand.
 
[V2]
 We have Christ at work within us,
 Shaping us to be like Him;
 Resurrection power sustaining
 Freedom from the snares of sin.
 Saying no to flesh desires,
 Saying yes to righteous ways;
 Filled with passion and with power,
 Lights that burn in darkened days.
 
[V3]
 We've the Spirit without measure,
 Helper, Comforter and Guide;
 One who brings the gifts of heaven,
 One who comes to walk beside.
 Taste of heaven's endless pleasure,
 Guarantee of what's to come;
 Causing fruit to grow in action,
 Bringing glory to the Son.
