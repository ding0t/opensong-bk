[V1]
 Come, see the Lord in His breathtaking splendour:
 Gaze at His majesty - bow and adore!
 Enter His presence with wonder and worship -
 He is the King and enthroned evermore.
 
[V2]
 He is the Word who was sent by the Father,
 Born as a baby, a child of our race:
 God here among us, revealed as a servant,
 Walking the pathway of truth and of grace.
 
[V3]
 He is the Lamb who was slain to redeem us -
 There at the cross His appearance was marred;
 Though He emerged from the grave as the victor,
 Still from the nails and the spear He is scarred.
 
[V4]
 He is the Lord who ascended in triumph -
 Ever the sound of His praises shall ring!
 Hail Him the First and the Last, the Almighty:
 Jesus, our Prophet, our Priest and our King.
 
[V5]
 Come, see the Lord in His breathtaking splendour:
 Gaze at His majesty - bow and adore!
 Come and acknowledge Him Saviour and Sovereign:
 Jesus our King is enthroned evermore.
