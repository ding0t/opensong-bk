[V1]
 O changeless Christ, for ever new,
 Who walked our earthly ways,
 Still draw our hearts as once You drew
 The hearts of other days.
 
[V2]
 As once You spoke by plain and hill
 Or taught by shore and sea,
 So be today our Teacher still,
 O Christ of Galilee.
 
[V3]
 As wind and storm their Master heard
 And His command fulfilled,
 May troubled hearts receive Your word,
 The tempest-tossed be stilled.
 
[V4]
 And as of old to all who prayed
 Your healing hand was shown,
 So be Your touch upon us laid,
 Unseen but not unknown.
 
[V5]
 In broken bread, in wine outpoured,
 Your new and living way
 Proclaim to us, O risen Lord,
 O Christ of this our day.
 
[V6]
 O changeless Christ, till life is past
 Your blessing still be given;
 Then bring us home, to taste at last
 The timeless joys of heaven.
