[C]
 Do not be afraid,
 For I have redeemed you.
 I have called you by your name;
 You are Mine.
 
[V1]
 When you walk through the waters I'll be with you;
 You will never sink beneath the waves.
 
[V2]
 When the fire is burning all around you,
 You will never be consumed by the flames.
 
[V3]
 When the fear of loneliness is looming,
 Then remember I am at your side.
 
[V4]
 When you dwell in the exile of the stranger,
 Remember you are precious in My eyes.
 
[V5]
 You are Mine, O My child; I am your Father,
 And I love you with a perfect love.
