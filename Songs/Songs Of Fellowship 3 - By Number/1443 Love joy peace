[C]
 Love, joy, peace and patience,
 Kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 Gentleness and self-control:
 This is the fruit of the Spirit.
 We want the fruit of the Spirit.
 ||Love, joy, peace and patience,
 Kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 Gentleness and self-control:
 We will reap what we sow,
 We will reap what we sow.
 
[V1]
 We want joy in the Spirit,
 We will rejoice in the Spirit of God.
 There is peace in the Spirit,
 We want to rest in the Spirit of God.
 
[V2]
 We want life in the Spirit,
 We want to live by the Spirit of God.
 Keep in step with the Spirit,
 We will be led by the Spirit of God.
 
[V3]
 Walking with the Spirit of Jesus.
 Living by the Spirit of Jesus.
 Rejoicing in the Spirit of Jesus.
 Resting in the Spirit of Jesus.
