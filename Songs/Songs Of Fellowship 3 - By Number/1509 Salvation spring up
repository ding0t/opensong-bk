[V1]
 Salvation, spring up from the ground,
 Lord, rend the heavens and come down.
 Seek the lost and heal the lame;
 Jesus, bring glory to Your name.
 Let all the prodigals run home,
 All of creation waits and groans.
 Lord, we've heard of Your great fame;
 Father, cause all to shout Your name.
 
[V2]
 Stir up our hearts, O God;
 Open our spirits to awe who You are.
 Put a cry in us
 So deep inside,
 That we cannot find 
 The words we need,
 We just weep and cry out to You.
