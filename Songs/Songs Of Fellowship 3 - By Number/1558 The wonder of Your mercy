[C]
 The wonder of Your mercy, Lord, 
 The beauty of Your grace, 
 That You would even pardon me 
 And bring me to this place. 
 I stand before Your holiness, 
 I can only stand amazed: 
 The sinless Saviour died to make 
 A covenant of grace. 
 
[V1]
 I only want to serve You, 
 Bring honour to Your name, 
 And though I've often failed You, 
 Your faithfulness remains. 
 I'll glory in my weakness, 
 That I might know Your strength. 
 I will live my life at the cross of Christ, 
 And raise a banner to proclaim: 
 
[V2]
 You welcome us before You,
 Into this holy place;
 The brilliance of Your glory
 Demands our endless praise.
 The One, the only Saviour
 Has opened heaven's doors;
 We can enter in, free from all our sin,
 By Your cleansing sacrifice.
