[V1]
 Oh fallen one, covered now in shame,
 He is your hope, He is your life.
 Though He should judge, 
 His anger turns away;
 Rise from the dust, beautiful one.
 
[V2]
 Don't be afraid,
 For you're not left alone;
 His heart of love is broken for you.
 Your Father cares 
 For all your children now,
 Arise in His name, beautiful one.
 
[C]
 Arise and shine, your glory has come,
 Arise and shine, your glory has come,
 Arise and shine,
 He is calling you by name;
 Though your walls have fallen down,
 He'll build you up again.
 
[V3]
 Lift up your eyes, 
 Many come to see
 The splendour your God has given to you.
 Could each of your saints
 Become a thousand saints?
 Rise up and praise, beautiful one.
 
[V4]
 So let Your salvation come,
 For Your glory, Lord.
 Set the captives free, we pray;
 These souls are Your reward.
