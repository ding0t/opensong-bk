[V1]
 Every breath I breathe comes from You,
 I'll never take it for granted. 
 All that I have, all I've ever needed, 
 You have provided.
 
[V2]
 You know when I sit, You know when I rise,
 You know my thoughts completely.
 You hem me in before and behind: 
 Such love is hard to describe. 
 
[C]
 You are my God, You are my God.
 As long as I have breath I will sing of Your greatness.
 You are my source, my all in all, 
 My first love, the One I love, 
 You are my God.
 
[V3]
 Precious to me are Your thoughts, O God;
 No wisdom or knowledge is greater.
 Praise be to You, Name above all names:
 ||Who reigns forever, ever and ever, (X3)
 Who reigns forevermore.
 You reign forever, ever and ever, (x3)
 You reign forevermore.
