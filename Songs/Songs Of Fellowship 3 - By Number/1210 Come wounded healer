[V1]
 Come, wounded healer, Your sufferings reveal -
 The scars You accepted, our anguish to heal.
 Your wounds bring such comfort in body and soul
 To all who bear torment and yearn to be whole.
 
[V2]
 Come, hated Lover, and gather us near,
 Your welcome, Your teaching, Your challenge to hear:
 Where scorn and abuse cause rejection and pain,
 Your loving acceptance makes hope live again!
 
[V3]
 Come, broken Victor, condemned to a cross -
 How great are the treasures we gain from Your loss!
 Your willing agreement to share in our strife
 Transforms our despair into fullness of life.
