[V1]
 No scenes of stately Majesty for the King of kings. 
 No nights aglow with candle flame for the King of love. 
 ||No flags of empire hung in shame for Calvary. 
 No flowers perfumed the lonely way that led Him to 
 A borrowed tomb for Easter Day. 
 
[V2]
 No wreaths upon the ground were laid for the King of kings. 
 Only a crown of thorns remained where He gave His love.
 ||A message scrawled in irony - 'King of the Jews' -
 Lay trampled where they turned away, and no one knew
 That it was the first Easter Day. 
 
[V3]
 Yet nature's finest colours blaze for the King of kings. 
 And stars in jewelled clusters say, 'Worship heaven's King.' 
 ||Two thousand springtimes more have bloomed - is that enough? 
 Oh, how can I be satisfied until He hears 
 The whole world sing of Easter love?
 
[V4]
 My prayers shall be a fragrance sweet for the King of kings. 
 My love the flowers at His feet for the King of love. 
 ||My vigil is to watch and pray until He comes; 
 My highest tribute to obey and live to know 
 The power of that first Easter Day.
 
[V5]
 I long for scenes of majesty for the risen King.
 Or nights aglow with candle flame for the King of love.
 ||A nation hushed upon its knees at Calvary,
 Where all our sins and griefs were nailed
 And hope was born of everlasting Easter Day.
