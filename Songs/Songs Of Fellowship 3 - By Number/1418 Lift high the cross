[C]
 Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim
 Till all the world adore His sacred name!
 
[V1]
 Come, brethren, follow where our Captain trod,
 Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.
 
[V2]
 Each new-born soldier of the Crucified
 Bears on his brow the seal of Him who died.
 
[V3]
 This is the sign which Satan's legions fear
 And angels veil their faces to revere.
 
[V4]
 Saved by this cross whereon their Lord was slain,
 The sons of Adam their lost home regain.
 
[V5]
 From north and south, from east and west they raise
 In growing unison their song of praise.
 
[V6]
 O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
 As Thou hast promised, draw men unto Thee.
 
[V7]
 Let every race and every language tell
 Of Him who saves our souls from death and hell.
 
[V8]
 Set up Thy throne, that earth's despair may cease
 Beneath the shadow of its healing peace.
