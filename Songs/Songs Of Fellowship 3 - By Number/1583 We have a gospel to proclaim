[V1]
 We have a gospel to proclaim,
 Good news for all throughout the earth;
 The gospel of a Saviour's name:
 We sing His glory, tell His worth.
 
[V2]
 Tell of His birth at Bethlehem,
 Not in a royal house or hall
 But in a stable dark and dim:
 The Word made flesh, a light for all.
 
[V3]
 Tell of His death at Calvary,
 Hated by those He came to save;
 In lonely suffering on the cross
 For all He loved His life He gave.
 
[V4]
 Tell of that glorious Easter morn:
 Empty the tomb, for He was free.
 He broke the power of death and hell
 That we might share His victory.
 
[V5]
 Tell of His reign at God's right hand,
 By all creation glorified;
 He sends His Spirit on His Church
 To live for Him, the Lamb who died.
 
[V6]
 Now we rejoice to name Him King:
 Jesus is Lord of all the earth.
 This gospel message we proclaim:
 We sing His glory, tell His worth.
