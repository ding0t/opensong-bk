[V1]
 Hungry, I come to You,
 For I know You satisfy.
 I am empty, but I know
 Your love does not run dry.
 So I wait for You,
 So I wait for You.
 
[C]
 I'm falling on my knees,
 Offering all of me.
 Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.
 
[V2]
 Broken, I run to You,
 For Your arms are open wide;
 I am weary, but I know
 Your touch restores my life.
 So I wait for You,
 So I wait for You.
