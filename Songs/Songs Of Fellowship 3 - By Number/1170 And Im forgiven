[V1]
 And I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken.
 And I'm accepted: You were condemned.
 And I'm alive and well, 
 Your Spirit is within me,
 Because You died and rose again.
 
[C]
 Amazing love, how can it be
 That You, my King, would die for me?
 Amazing love, I know it's true;
 Now it's my joy to honour You.
 In all I do, I honour You.
 
[V2]
 You are my King, You are my King,
 Jesus, You are my King,
 You are my King.
