[V1]
 Lord, I am not my own, 
 No longer my own, 
 Living now for You, 
 And everything I think, 
 All I say and do 
 Is for You, my Lord. 
 
[V2]
 Now taking up the cross,
 Walking on Your paths,
 Holding out Your truth,
 Running in this race,
 Bowing every day,
 All for You, my Lord.
 
[C]
 And what I have vowed 
 I will make good.
 Every promise made 
 Will be fulfilled, 
 Till the day I die, 
 Every day I live 
 Is for You, is for You, is for You, 
 Is for You, is for You, is for You. 
 
[V3]
 Earth has nothing I desire
 That lives outside of You,
 I'm consumed with You.
 Treasures have no hold,
 Nothing else will do,
 Only You, my Lord.
