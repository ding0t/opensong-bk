[V1]
 Angels bow before You,
 Kings fall at Your command.
 And yet Your love comes down to earth
 To fallen man.
 How can I know Your workings,
 Eternal mystery?
 I must bow down and give my life,
 Must follow You.
 
[V2]
 And I love You, Lord,
 Everything belongs to You,
 Is known by You,
 And made for Your eternal glory.
 You, my Lord, receive the praise
 Of my thankful heart.
