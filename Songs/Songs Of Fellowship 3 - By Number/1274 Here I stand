[V1]
 Here I stand, longing to meet with God;
 I have come, bringing a grateful heart.
 And I will sing of this amazing love again.
 Here I am, falling before Your throne,
 For my King laying down any crown,
 And I'll sing of this amazing love again.
 
[V2]
 Here I am before Your throne of grace;
 I can come, for You have made a way,
 And I'll sing of this amazing love again.
 Here I am, so overwhelmed by You;
 I come near, for I belong to You,
 And I'll sing of this amazing love again.
 
[C]
 I am in love with God,
 I am in love with God,
 I hear You call my name,
 I give my heart again.
 I am in love with God,
 I am in love with God,
 I hear You call my name,
 I'm on my knees again.
 
[V3]
 You have won my heart and I can say 
 That I could find no other way.
 Now I am Yours, and here I'll stay
 To offer up this praise.
 
[V4]
 I'm in love with You,
 I'm in love with You.
