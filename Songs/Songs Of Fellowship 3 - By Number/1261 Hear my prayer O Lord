[V1]
 Hear my prayer, O Lord,
 From the ends of the earth I cry.
 Your peace will lead me to 
 The Rock that is higher than I.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 For You have been my strength in times of trouble,
 A tower above my enemies.
 And Lord, I will abide with you forever
 In the shelter of Your wings.
 (Repeat)
