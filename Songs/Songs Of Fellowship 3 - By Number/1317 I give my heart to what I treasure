[V1]
 I give my heart to what I treasure;
 My devotion, everything I am.
 Like a diamond, You treat me like I'm precious;
 To be Yours is more than I deserve.
 
[C]
 Jesus, You are my treasure;
 Jesus, nothing less will do.
 Jesus, I am Yours forever;
 Jesus, I want to live for You.
 
[V2]
 We are a people holy to our Saviour;
 For this moment He has gathered us
 To bring hope and healing to the nations,
 Till His name is known in all the earth.
