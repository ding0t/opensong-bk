[V1]
 I can feel Your arms surrounding,
 Treasuring my soul.
 Draw me ever closer into Your love,
 Into Your love.
 ||Lead me to Your place of wonder,
 Shower me with grace.
 Holy God, forgive my unrighteous ways,
 Unrighteous ways.
 
[V2]
 Oh I love You, Lord,
 All I am is Yours,
 As Your mercy pours into my heart.
 You're my faithful King,
 Over everything,
 Hear my spirit sing that Jesus is Lord.
