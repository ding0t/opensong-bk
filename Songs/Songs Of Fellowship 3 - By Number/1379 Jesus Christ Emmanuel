[V1]
 Jesus Christ, Emmanuel,
 The Saviour of the world;
 Creator of the universe,
 The true and living Word.
 Let every tongue confess Your name,
 And bow the knee before Your hand of grace,
 Giving You the highest praise.
 
[C]
 You are, You are the everlasting Prince of Peace,
 The First, the Last in whom all things were made.
 ||You reign with love, Counsellor, Almighty God.
 Jesus, You're the Name by which we're saved,
 Jesus, You're the Name above all names.
 
[V2]
 Holy One upon the throne,
 To You the angels sing.
 And here we join their heavenly song,
 Proclaiming You as King.
 Let every tongue confess Your name,
 We bow the knee before Your hand of grace,
 Giving You the highest praise.
