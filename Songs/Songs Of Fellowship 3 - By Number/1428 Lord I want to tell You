[V1]
 Lord, I want to tell You 
 How much I love You;
 Your tenderness and mercy 
 Have overwhelmed my heart. 
 Let my whole life be
 An overflow of worship:
 All I have and all I am 
 I give back, Lord, to You.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I want to tell You 
 My heart's desire,
 The love You've put within me 
 Will burn with holy fire.
 Let my actions spring 
 From an overflow of worship:
 All I have and all I am 
 I gladly give back to You.
