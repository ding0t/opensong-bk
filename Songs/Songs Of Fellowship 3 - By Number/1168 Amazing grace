[V1]
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me;
 I once was lost, but now am found,
 Was blind, but now I see.
 
[C]
 Amazing love has come to me.
 I lift up my voice to the heavens,
 Lift up my hands to the King,
 And I cry 'hosanna, hosanna in the highest.'
 Jesus my Lord is exalted
 Far above every name,
 And I cry 'hosanna, hosanna in the highest.'
 
[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 And grace my fears relieved;
 How precious did that grace appear,
 The hour I first believed!
 
[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me,
 His word my hope secures;
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures.
