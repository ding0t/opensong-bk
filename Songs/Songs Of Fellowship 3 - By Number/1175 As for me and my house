[V1]
 As for me and my house,
 As for me and my family,
 As for me and my children,
 We will serve the Lord.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 In this family,
 We're gonna do things properly,
 Read God's word every day
 And then we'll try to pray;
 Although we get it wrong,
 We will still carry on,
 Make Jesus number one in this place.
 In this place we're gonna say grace.
