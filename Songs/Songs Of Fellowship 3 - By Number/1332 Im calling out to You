[V1]
 I'm calling out to You,
 There must be something more,
 Some deeper place to find,
 Some secret place to hide
 Where I have not gone before.
 ||Where my soul is satisfied,
 And my sin is put to death,
 And I can hear Your voice,
 Your purpose is my choice,
 As natural as a breath.
 
[V2]
 The love I knew before, 
 When You first touched my life,
 I need You to restore,
 I want You to revive.
 
[C]
 Oh, place in my heart a passion for Jesus,
 A hunger that seizes my passion for You.
 My one desire, my greatest possession,
 My only confession, my passion for You.
