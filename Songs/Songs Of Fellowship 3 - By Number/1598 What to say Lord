[V1]
 What to say, Lord?
 It's You who gave me life,
 And I can't explain just how much You mean to me
 Now that You have saved me, Lord.
 I give all that I am to You,
 That every day I can be a light that shines Your name.
 
[V2]
 Every day, Lord, 
 I'll learn to stand upon Your word,
 And I pray that I, 
 That I may come to know You more,
 That You would guide me
 In every single step I take,
 That every day I can be Your light unto the world.
 
[C]
 Every day, it's You I'll live for, 
 Every day, I'll follow after You.
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord.
 
[V3]
 It's You I live for every day,
 It's You I live for every day,
 It's You I live for every day.
