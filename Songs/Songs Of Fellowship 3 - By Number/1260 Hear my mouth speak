[V1]
 Hear my mouth speak, see my mind think,
 Know my spirit tries to pray.
 Lord, we're longing to see You moving,
 Help us as we pray today.
 ||Words don't seem enough to tell You our desire,
 To see Your kingdom come and Your light shine.
 
[C]
 Light of the world, would You shine on me?
 Light of the world, would You shine on me?
 
[V2]
 Now I trust You, and I ask You,
 Let Your will be done in me.
 May Your light shine in all the earth and
 Let it draw us all to You.
 ||Now Your glory shines throughout Your holy church,
 'Cause You're our only hope, Saviour of the world.
 
[V3]
 Shine on me so I reflect Your glory,
 Live in me so people see Your beauty,
 Pour on me, so out of me flow streams of living water.
 (Repeat)
