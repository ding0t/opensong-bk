[V1]
 When words are not enough 
 To tell of all You've done, 
 I bow the knee, let silence speak, 
 And gaze upon Your majesty. 
 
[V2]
 These songs could not convey
 A picture of Your love;
 And knowing this, my life I give
 To You, an offering of praise.
 
[C]
 And I surrender all, 
 And I surrender all; 
 Unveil my heart to see 
 The wonder of Your worth, 
 As I surrender all, 
 As I surrender all.  
 
[V3]
 The worship You require
 Is brokenness of heart;
 So here I stand with open hands,
 Surrendered to Your love and power.
