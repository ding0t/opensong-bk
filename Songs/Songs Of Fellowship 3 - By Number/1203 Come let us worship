[V1]
 Come, let us worship the King of kings,
 The Creator of all things.
 Let your soul arise to Him,
 Come and bless the Lord our King.
 
[V2]
 Lord, my heart and voice I raise,
 To praise Your wondrous ways,
 And with confidence I come
 To approach Your heavenly throne.
 
[V3]
 Come and fill this place with Your glory,
 Come and captivate our gaze;
 Come and fill us with Your fire,
 That the world might know Your name.
 
[C]
 (For) You are God,
 And You're worthy to be praised,
 And You are good,
 For Your love will never end:
 The great I Am,
 You are faithful in all of Your ways.
 (Repeat)
