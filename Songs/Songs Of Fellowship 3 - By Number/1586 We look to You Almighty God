[V1]
 We look to You, Almighty God, 
 You are high and lifted up, 
 You are sovereign over all 
 That You have made. 
 Over kingdoms and their kings, 
 You are Lord of everything, 
 Over things on earth 
 And things that are unseen. 
 
[C]
 And we rejoice in You, 
 We put our trust in You, 
 And with one voice we give You praise. 
 Singing, let Your kingdom come, 
 And let Your will be done, 
 And through Your people 
 Make Your glory known.         
 
[V2]
 Lord, we come to seek Your face,
 Let Your glory fill this place,
 We are hungry for Your 
 Presence in this hour.
 To behold You as You are,
 Heaven's bright and morning Star,
 Let our hearts be changed,
 And let Your kingdom come!
