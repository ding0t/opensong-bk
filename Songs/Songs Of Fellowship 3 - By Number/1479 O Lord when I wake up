[V1]
 O Lord, when I wake up in the morning,
 Let my mouth be filled with praise for You.
 O Lord, when I go out in the evening,
 Let my mouth be filled with praise for You.
 ||That all might know, yeah,
 And many might see, yeah,
 That You're my Lord.
 
[V2]
 Fill me with a spirit of boldness, O my God, 
 And come and take all of my shame;
 That I might see temptation 
 Melt before my eyes
 And watch the demons flee in Jesus' name,
 As we lift high the name.
 
[C]
 Lift high the name of the Lord.
 Lift high the name of the Lord.
 That many might know, 
 That many might see my Lord.
 
[V3]
 O Lord, when I'm stressed and feeling tired,
 Let my mouth be filled with praise to You.
 O Lord, when I'm pressed on every side,
 Let my mouth be filled with praise to You.
 ||That all might know, yeah,
 And many might see, yeah,
 That You are Lord.
