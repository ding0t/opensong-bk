[V1]
 Like the sunshine after rainfall, 
 Like the gentle breeze;
 Like the stillness of the morning, 
 Like the radiant trees:
 These things I knew before, 
 But never have they spoken such life to me;
 Oh, the wonder of a Maker 
 Whose heart delights in me.
 
[V2]
 Like the nurture of a baby 
 At its mother's breast;
 Like the closeness of a lover,
 Like two souls at rest:
 These things I knew before,
 But never have they spoken such peace to me;
 Oh, the wonder of Maker
 Whose heart delights in me.
 
[V3]
 The heavens declare His magnificence,
 The earth resounds with His praise;
 Be still my soul, and be satisfied 
 To worship Him,
 To worship Him.
 
[V4]
 Like the vastness of a desert, 
 Like the ocean's roar;
 Like the greatness of the mountains,
 Where the eagles soar:
 These things I knew before,
 But never have they spoken such power to me;
 Oh, the wonder of a Maker
 Whose heart delights in me.
