[V1]
 Now, in reverence and awe
 We gather round Your word;
 In wonder we draw near 
 To mysteries that angels strain to hear,
 That prophets dimly saw:
 So let Your Spirit 
 Shine upon the page and...
 
[C]
 Teach me,
 Open my eyes with truth to free me,
 Light to chase the lies.
 Lord Jesus, let me meet You in Your word;
 Lord Jesus, let me meet You in Your word.
 
[V2]
 Lord, Your truth cannot be chained,
 It searches everything -
 My secrets, my desires.
 Your word is like a hammer and a fire,
 It breaks, it purifies:
 So let Your Spirit
 Shine into my heart and...
