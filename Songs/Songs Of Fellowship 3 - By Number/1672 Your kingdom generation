[V1]
 Your kingdom generation
 Declares Your majesty,
 And our lives are resounding with Your praise.
 We see Your Spirit moving,
 We burn with holy fire.
 ||Your glory is seen through all the earth.
 You set eternity in my heart,
 So I'll live for You, for You.
 
[V2]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Honour and praise forever.
 We'll shout a victory cry from here 
 To eternity.
 ||Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 We'll take our place in history.
 We'll shout Your awesome love from here 
 To eternity.
