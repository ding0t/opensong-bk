[V1]
 My heart is captivated, Lord, by You alone;
 Captured by the awesomeness of You alone.
 Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown,
 I stand in wonder.
 ||I reach to You, 
 The One who makes the blind eyes see,
 Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority.
 Restoring what was broken, 
 So it may fly again.
 
[V2]
 I live to worship You;
 I breathe to worship You.
 All of my days Your face I will seek.
 For as I worship You,
 You lead me to that place,
 To that place of divine exchange.
