[V1]
 I lift You high, and bow down low, 
 How high can You be? 
 How low can I go? 
 I lift You high, and bow down low, 
 How high can You be? 
 How low can I go?
 O Lord?
 
[V2]
 You must increase, 
 I must decrease, Lord.
 I'll bow down, 
 And You will be adored. 
 
[V3]
 I lift You high, and bow down low, 
 How high can You be? 
 How low can I go? 
 I lift You high, and bow down low, 
 How high can You be? 
 How low can I go?
