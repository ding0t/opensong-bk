[V1]
 Worthy, You are worthy,
 Much more worthy than I've known;
 I cannot imagine
 Just how glorious You are.
 I cannot begin to tell
 How deep a love You bring;
 Lord, my ears have heard of You,
 But now my eyes have seen.
 
[C]
 You're worthy, You're worthy, You're worthy,
 You're worthy to be praised,
 Forever and a day.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Glory, I give glory
 To the One who saved my soul.
 You found me and You freed me
 From the shame that was my own.
 I cannot begin to tell
 How merciful You've been;
 Lord, my ears have heard of You,
 Now my eyes have seen.
 
[C2]
 Your glory, Your glory, Your glory,
 Your glory reaches high,
 So high above the heavens.
