[V1]
 I don't know why, I can't see how
 Your precious blood could cleanse me now;
 When all this time I've lived a lie,
 With no excuse, no alibi.
 
[C]
 All I know is I find mercy;
 All my shame You take from me.
 All I know, Your cross has power,
 And the blood You shed cleanses me.
 
[V2]
 It's way beyond what I can see,
 How anyone could die for me.
 So undeserved, this precious grace;
 You've won my heart, I'll seek Your face.
