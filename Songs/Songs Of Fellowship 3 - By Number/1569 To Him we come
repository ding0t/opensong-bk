[V1]
 To Him we come -
 Jesus Christ our Lord,
 God's own living Word,
 His dear Son:
 In Him there is no east and west,
 In Him all nations shall be blest;
 To all He offers peace and rest -
 Loving Lord!
 
[V2]
 In Him we live - 
 Christ our strength and stay,
 Life and Truth and Way,
 Friend divine:
 His power can break the chains of sin,
 Still all life's storms without, within,
 Help us the daily fight to win - 
 Living Lord!
 
[V3]
 For Him we go - 
 Soldiers of the cross,
 Counting all things loss,
 Him to know;
 Going to every land and race,
 Preaching to all redeeming grace,
 Building His church in every place - 
 Conquering Lord!
 
[V4]
 With Him we serve - 
 His the work we share
 With saints everywhere,
 Near and far;
 One in the task that faith requires,
 One in the zeal that never tires,
 One in the hope His love inspires - 
 Coming Lord!
 
[V5]
 Onward we go -
 Faithful, bold and true,
 Called His will to do
 Day by day
 Till, at the last, with joy we'll see
 Jesus in glorious majesty;
 Live with Him through eternity -
 Reigning Lord!
