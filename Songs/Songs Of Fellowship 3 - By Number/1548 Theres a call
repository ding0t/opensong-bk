[V1]
 There's a call to the people of Zion,
 To arise and possess the land;
 Every town has its heirs to the promise,
 Every nation its sons of light.
 ||We have stayed long enough on this mountain,
 Now we're called to new realms of faith;
 We are more than a temple of worship,
 We're an army of praise!
 
[C]
 We will go to every place,
 Sharing mercy and preaching grace,
 For the fields are white for harvest,
 And labourers are few.
 ||No place too dark, no soul too lost
 For the power of the cross;
 For His light will shine in darkness,
 And many will believe,
 So we will go.
 
[V2]
 We have drunk of the wine of His presence,
 We have feasted upon His word;
 Now we're hungry for works of power,
 Now we're thirsty to share His love.
 ||He will give us the ground that we walk on,
 For the battle belongs to God;
 Do not fear, for His grace is sufficient,
 When we're weak, He is strong!
