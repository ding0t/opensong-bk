[V1]
 God of restoration, 
 My hope is in the life You bring to me. 
 Healer of my wounds, 
 I thank You, oh I thank You.
 ||God of my salvation, 
 With saving love You came to rescue me. 
 Healer of my soul, 
 I thank You, oh I thank You,
 Today and every day. 
 
[C]
 I am Yours, I am Yours, 
 Every breath that I breathe, 
 Every moment that's lived.
 ||I am Yours, I am Yours, 
 You're the reason to breathe, 
 You're the reason to live.
 And now everyone that You have saved 
 Will come to be Your praise, 
 I am Yours.
 
[V2]
 Singing of a love now,
 You taught this broken heart to sing again.
 Every day I'll come 
 To thank You, oh, to thank You.
 ||Singing of a life now,
 You taught this wounded soul to live again.
 Every day I'll live 
 To thank You, oh, to thank You,
 Today and every day.
 
[V3]
 And if my food is to do Your will,
 Then I'm hungry, still hungry;
 There's so much more that I need to give
 To thank You, to thank You.
 ||Yes, if my food is to do Your will,
 Then I'm hungry, still hungry;
 There's so much more that I need to give
 Today and every day.
