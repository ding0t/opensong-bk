[V1]
 A refuge for the poor,
 A shelter from the storm:
 This is our God.
 He will wipe away your tears
 And return your wasted years:
 This is our God.
 
[C]
 Oh, mmm, this is our God.
 Oh, mmm, this is our God.
 
[V2]
 A Father to the orphan,
 A healer to the broken:
 This is our God.
 He brings peace to our madness
 And comfort in our sadness:
 This is our God.
 
[V3]
 A fountain for the thirsty,
 A lover for the lonely:
 This is our God.
 He brings glory to the humble
 And crowns for the faithful:
 This is our God.
 
[V4]
 This is the One we have waited for,
 This is the One we have waited for,
 This is the One we have waited for.
