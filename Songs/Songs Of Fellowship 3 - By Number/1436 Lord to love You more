[V1]
 Lord, to love You more is all I want,
 To hear You speaking to my heart,
 To be consumed by You again.
 Fix my eyes on You and draw me near,
 Let all distractions disappear,
 I need You even more today.
 
[V2]
 For Jesus, I am overwhelmed
 By all Your love has done,
 And all I want to say is that I adore You, Lord.
 I'm humbled by the grace of God,
 You met my every need,
 And Jesus, You will be always my greatest love.
 
[V3]
 I adore You.
 I adore You.
 I adore You.
 I adore You.
