[C]
 I'm cradled, 
 Cradled in the arms of love.
 Yes, I'm cradled, 
 Cradled in the arms of love.
 
[V1]
 My struggles for approval
 Were never meant to be.
 To know that I'm accepted
 Is Your desire for me.
 Because...
 
[V2]
 My fears about the future,
 All my anxieties,
 Are calmed when I surrender
 To the One who's holding me.
