[V1]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 All to Him I freely give;
 I will ever love and trust Him,
 In His presence daily live.
 
[C]
 I surrender all,
 I surrender all,
 All to Thee, my bless√®d Saviour,
 I surrender all.
 
[V2]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Humbly at His feet I bow;
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
 Take me, Jesus, take me now.
 
[V3]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
 Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
 Truly know that Thou art mine.
 
[V4]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Lord, I give myself to Thee;
 Fill me with Thy love and power,
 Let Thy blessing fall on me.
 
[V5]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Now I feel the sacred flame;
 O the joy of full salvation!
 Glory, glory to His name!
