[V1]
 Awake, my soul, rise up from your sleeping;
 Do not slumber or sleep any more.
 Raise your weary head to a new day;
 Lift your shout, let your voice be heard.
 
[V2]
 Rocks will cry out if we are silent,
 Trees will clap their hands and rejoice;
 The mighty ocean roars with a new song,
 Mountains bow down to honour Your name.
 
[C]
 Rise up, my soul, and sing.
 Rise up, my soul, and sing.
 Rise up, my soul, and give glory to the Lord.
 (Repeat)
 
[V3]
 Let the song of a bride in blooming
 Thunder clap through the heavens above.
 Rising up in true adoration,
 Arise and shine for Your light has come.
 
[V4]
 I don't want to sleep any more,
 But I'll awake the dawn with singing.
 Hear this crying heart of mine,
 As I lift up my song.
 (Repeat)
 
[V5]
 Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up.
