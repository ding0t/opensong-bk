[V1]
 There's a new song upon my lips,
 A song I always knew.
 Thank You for all that You do.
 There is fire burning in my heart,
 A fire of faith in You.
 I believe all the things we can do.
 
[C]
 You're the God of great things,
 You're the God of great things.
 I won't hold back my thanks to You.
 Thank You, thank You,
 Hey, Jesus, I adore You.
 Thank You, thank You,
 Hey, Jesus, I live for You.
 
[V2]
 There's a beat pounding through my feet,
 A new dance of thanks to You.
 I'm tasting the joy found in You.
 There is courage building in my heart;
 A strength that comes from You.
 I'm going to live my life for You.
