[V1]
 Where could I find someone like You?
 Unbounded love in all You do.
 So I seek to know You more,
 I'll press into Your word again,
 And drawing on Your Spirit's power,
 And drinking from that well again.
 
[V2]
 For heaven and earth are in Your hands,
 This universe within Your plans.
 Dust of life no eye can see,
 They only stir when You command.
 Some divine permission given,
 Empowered by Your mighty hand.
 
[C]
 And You knew me in the secret place
 As my being formed, You beheld my days.
 And You know me now, You know all my ways, 
 Nothing's hid from You,
 I'm with You always.
 
[V3]
 My weakest means, my poorest words 
 To tell this world of Your redeeming love.
 By Your Holy Spirit's power 
 Is articulation given,
 Message to the poor in heart, 
 That Jesus Christ is risen again.
 
[C2]
 And You knew me in the secret place
 As my being formed, You decreed my days.
 And You know me now, You know all my ways, 
 Nothing's hid from You,
 I'm with You always.
