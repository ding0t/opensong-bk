[V1]
 May the mind of Christ my Saviour
 Live in me from day to day,
 By His love and power controlling
 All I do and say.
 
[V2]
 May the word  of God dwell richly
 In my heart from hour to hour,
 So that all may see I triumph
 Only through His power.
 
[V3]
 May the peace of God my Father
 Rule my life in everything,
 That I may be calm to comfort
 Sick and sorrowing.
 
[V4]
 May the love of Jesus fill me,
 As the waters fill the sea;
 Him exalting, self abasing,
 This is victory.
 
[V5]
 May I run the race before me,
 Strong and brave to face the foe,
 Looking only unto Jesus,
 As I onward go.
