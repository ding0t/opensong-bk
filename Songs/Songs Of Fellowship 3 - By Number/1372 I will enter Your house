[V1]
 I will enter Your house with thanksgiving,
 I will sing of Your goodness to me.
 For my heart is eternally grateful,
 I am blessed abundantly.
 
[V2]
 You have given me life in all its fullness,
 And joy no words can describe.
 But I know it's for more than me,
 It's for those, those You sent me to reach.
 
[C]
 I am blessed, blessed to be a blessing,
 I am blessed, I live under an open heaven,
 Blessed, that all may see
 It's Christ, Christ in me.
 (Repeat)
