[V1]
 You have laid Your hand on me, 
 I am changed forever; 
 There is nothing that compares 
 With knowing You. 
 You have spoken words of love 
 That lift my Spirit higher; 
 Jesus Christ, my dearest friend, 
 I'm never letting go. 
 
[C]
 How can I live, how can I live, 
 How can I live without Your love? 
 How can I live, how can I live, 
 How can I live without Your love? 
 
[V2]
 Help me never to forget 
 What I used to be,
 Though the past that I regret 
 Is over now. 
 I will never be ashamed 
 Of calling You my friend. 
 I no longer hide from You, 
 I'm running to Your side.  
 
[V3]
 All the riches I possess 
 Are meaningless to me;
 Your love is the greatest gift, 
 The very air I breathe.
