[V1]
 Lord, let Your glory fall
 As on that ancient day;
 Songs of enduring love,
 And then Your glory came.
 And as a sign to You
 That we would love the same,
 Our hearts will sing that song:
 God, let Your glory come.
 
[C]
 You are good, You are good,
 And Your love endures.
 You are good, You are good,
 And Your love endures.
 You are good, You are good,
 And Your love endures today.
 
[V2]
 Voices in unison,
 Giving You thanks and praise,
 Joined by the instruments,
 And then Your glory came.
 Your presence like a cloud 
 Upon that ancient day;
 The priests were overwhelmed
 Because Your glory came.
 
[V3]
 A sacrifice was made,
 And then Your fire came;
 They knelt upon the ground,
 And with one voice they praised.
 (Repeat)
