[V1]
 Almighty God, faithful and true,
 In my worship I want to meet with You.
 Unchanging God, forever the same,
 It's You I worship,
 To know Your heart again.
 
[V2]
 And I fall down on my knees again,
 As You show me what grace means;
 And You love with such amazing love,
 O my God, how can this be?
