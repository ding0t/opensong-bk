[C]
 Jesus, King of the ages,
 Pleading our cause before the throne of God.
 Jesus, the living Word of God,
 Our Prophet, Priest and King,
 Our Prophet, Priest and King.
 
[V1]
 From the start You were there, Word of God,
 Ancient promises You came to fulfil;
 You came revealing the Father's heart,
 His favour, His purpose, His will:
 Sharing His good news with the poor,
 Declaring God's kingdom is here.
 
[V2]
 At the cross You poured out costly blood,
 Perfect sacrifice, atoning for sin,
 So we may enter the holy place
 To meet You, our faithful High Priest;
 As we come to the mercy seat
 We find grace in our time of need.
 
[V3]
 Jesus shall reign at the Father's hand
 Till all of His enemies cease:
 Hell and destruction, disease and death
 Are under His glorious feet.
 
[V4]
 We will reign with Christ, (echo)
 We will reign with Christ, (echo)
 We will reign with Christ (echo)
 Forever.
