[V1]
 You are God in heaven,
 And here am I on earth;
 So I'll let my words be few:
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
 
[C]
 And I'll stand in awe of You,
 Yes, I'll stand in awe of You.
 And I'll let my words be few:
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
 
[V2]
 The simplest of all love songs
 I want to bring to You;
 So I'll let my words be few:
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
