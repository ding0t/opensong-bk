[V1]
 The people who walk in darkness
 Will see a great light,
 For those who live in the land
 Of the shadow of death,
 The light will shine.
 
[V2]
 You will enlarge the nation,
 And increase their joy,
 So they delight in Your presence
 As they will rejoice
 At harvest time.
 
[V3]
 For to us a Child is born,
 To us a Son is given,
 And the government
 Will be upon His shoulders.
 Of His government and peace
 There will always be increase;
 There is no end to His kingdom.
 
[C]
 He will be called Wonderful,
 Counsellor, Mighty God,
 Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
 (Repeat)
 The Prince of Peace.
 
[V4]
 For to us a Child is born,
 To us a Son is given,
 And the government
 Will be upon Your shoulders.
 Come to break our yoke of grief,
 The bar across our shoulders;
 Lord, smash the rod of our oppressors.
 
[C2]
 You will be called Wonderful,
 Counsellor, Mighty God,
 Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
 (Repeat)
 The Prince of Peace.
