[C]
 Calling all nations, hear the story 
 Of God's amazing grace.
 Calling all nations, come and worship, 
 Fill the earth with praise. 
 
[V1]
 Every woman, every man, 
 Rich and poor, old and young, 
 Heaven's love is coming down
 To wipe all your tears away.
 
[V2]
 There's a bell to be rung,
 There's a song to be sung.
 Sweeter music yet to play
 When we gather on that day.
