[C]
 Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,
 Open the eyes of my heart.
 I want to see You,
 I want to see You.
 (Repeat)
 
[V1]
 To see You high and lifted up,
 Shining in the light of Your glory.
 Pour out Your power and love,
 As we sing holy, holy, holy.
 
[V2]
 Holy, holy, holy,
 Holy, holy,holy,
 Holy holy holy, 
 I want to see You.
