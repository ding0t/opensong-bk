[V1]
 It was on a starry night when the hills were bright,
 Earth lay sleeping, sleeping calm and still;
 Then in a cattle shed, in a manger bed
 A boy was born, King of all the world.
 
[C]
 And all the angels sang for Him,
 The bells of heaven rang for Him;
 For a boy was born, King of all the world.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Soon the shepherds came that way, where the baby lay,
 And were kneeling, kneeling by His side.
 And their hearts believed again, for the peace of men;
 For a boy was born, King of all the world.
