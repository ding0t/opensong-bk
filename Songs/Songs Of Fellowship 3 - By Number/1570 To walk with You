[V1]
 To walk with You, to know You near me,
 To know Your voice, to hear You call me;
 This is all I ask of You.
 ||To be Your son, to feel You hold me,
 To know Your grace, to know You love me;
 This is all I ask of You,
 This is all I ask of You.
 
[C]
 To be Your joy, to give You glory;
 To live with You, forever with me.
 To love You, Lord, as You have loved me,
 Is all I ask of You, 
 All I ask of You.
 
[V2]
 To love Your ways, to see Your beauty,
 To seek Your face with all that's in me;
 This is all I ask of You.
 ||To worship You, to be Yours only,
 To cry Your name, my Lord Almighty;
 This is all I ask of You,
 This is all I ask of You.
 
[V3]
 To live Your life, to serve You justly,
 To tell Your word, to show Your mercy;
 ||This is all I ask of You.
 To bring Your light to those who know me,
 To be like You, as You are holy;
 This is all I ask of You,
 This is all I ask of You.
