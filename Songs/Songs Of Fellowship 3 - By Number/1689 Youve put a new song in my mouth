[C]
 You've put a new song in my mouth;
 It is a hymn of praise to You.
 Justice and mercy are its theme,
 And I will live it back to You.
 
[V1]
 The kind of fast You've chosen, Lord,
 It must reach out 
 To broken lives and to the poor:
 So change me, Lord.
 
[V2]
 I know You are the orphan's hope, 
 I know You are the widow's song;
 You're Father where no father lives,
 And to the lonely You're a friend.
 O Lord, You're showing me what's on Your heart.
 
[V3]
 Lord, I won't bring an empty song; 
 It's meaningless 
 Without compassion in my life, 
 And holiness.
