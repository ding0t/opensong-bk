[V1]
 I behold Your power and glory,
 Bring an offering, come before You;
 Worship You, Lord,
 In the beauty of Your holiness.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Whenever I call, You're there,
 Redeemer and Friend;
 Cherished beyond all words,
 This love never ends.
 Morning by morning 
 Your mercy awakens my soul.
 
[V3]
 I lift up my eyes to see
 The wonders of heaven
 Opening over me,
 Your goodness abounds;
 You've taken my breath away
 With Your irresistible love.
