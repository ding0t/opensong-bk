[V1]
 Befriended, 
 Befriended by the King above all kings.
 Surrendered, 
 Surrendered to the Friend above all friends.
 
[V2]
 Invited, 
 Invited deep into this mystery.
 Delighted, 
 Delighted by the wonders I have seen.
 
[C]
 This will be my story, 
 This will be my song:
 You'll always be my Saviour, 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart.
 
[V3]
 Astounded, 
 Astounded that Your gospel beckoned me.
 Surrounded, 
 Surrounded, but I've never been so free.
 
[V4]
 Determined, 
 Determined now to live this life for You.
 You're so worthy, 
 My greatest gift would be the least You're due.
