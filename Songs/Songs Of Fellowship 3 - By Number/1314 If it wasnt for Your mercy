[V1]
 If it wasn't for Your mercy,
 If it wasn't for Your love,
 If it wasn't for Your kindness,
 How could I stand?
 
[V2]
 If it wasn't for Your cleansing,
 If it wasn't for Your blood,
 If it wasn't for Your goodness,
 How could I stand?
 
[C]
 And yet I find myself again
 Where even angels fear to tread,
 Where I would never dare to come,
 But for the cleansing of Your blood.
 
[V3]
 With You there is forgiveness,
 And therefore You are feared.
 Jesus, it's Your loving kindness
 That brings me to my knees.
 
[V4]
 In the beauty of Your holiness.
 In the beauty of Your holiness.
 In the beauty of Your holiness.
 In the beauty of Your holiness.
