[V1]
 Jesus Christ, Holy one,
 The lifter of our heads,
 Through You I come, conquering Son,
 To my Father in heaven.
 And I'm confident that I belong to You,
 As the Spirit testifies.
 I shall not fear, fear has no hold,
 So I cry 'Abba Father!'
 
[C]
 What mercies You have poured on me,
 With thankfulness I'll sing;
 I choose to fix my mind 
 On all the blessings You have given me.
 ||For You've revealed to me Your grace,
 The wonder of the cross;
 You've breathed new life to me,
 And in Your victory I now stand today.
