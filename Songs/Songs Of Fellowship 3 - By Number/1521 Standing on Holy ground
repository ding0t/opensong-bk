[V1]
 Standing on Holy ground,
 Mercy and grace I've found.
 I'm here before Your throne now,
 By a new and living way.
 Jesus, I come to You.
 I lift up my eyes to You.
 How You've comforted me,
 And now I long to see Your face.
 
[C1]
 You are my strength, my song;
 You are my shield, my Redeemer.
 You are my hope, my salvation,
 And my God.
 I'll always bring my praise to You, 
 O God.
 
[C2]
 You are my strength, my song;
 You are my shield, my Redeemer.
 You are my hope, my salvation,
 And my God.
 ||So I will sing to You,
 Beautiful things You have done.
 Great is Your name in Zion,
 Holy One.
 I'll always bring my praise to You,
 I'll always bring my praise to You,
 I'll always bring my praise to You, 
 O God.
