[V1]
 Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
 Through this world's tempestuous sea;
 Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us -
 You our only help and plea;
 Here possessing every blessing
 If our God our Father be.
 
[V2]
 Saviour, by Your grace restore us,
 All our weaknesses are plain;
 You have lived on earth before us,
 You have felt our grief and pain:
 Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted,
 From the depths You rose again.
 
[V3]
 Spirit of our God, descending,
 Fill our hearts with holy peace;
 Love with every passion blending,
 Pleasure that can never cease:
 Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
 Ever shall our joys increase.
