[V1]
 Born in the night, Mary's child,
 A long way from Your home;
 Coming in need, Mary's child,
 Born in a borrowed room.
 
[V2]
 Clear shining light, Mary's child,
 Your face lights up our way:
 Light of the world, Mary's child,
 Dawn on our darkened day.
 
[V3]
 Truth of our life, Mary's child,
 You tell us God is good:
 Prove it is true, Mary's child,
 Go to Your cross of wood.
 
[V4]
 Hope of the world, Mary's child,
 You're coming soon to reign:
 King of the earth, Mary's child,
 Walk in our streets again.
