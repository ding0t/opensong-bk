[V1]
 I love You, Lord, I worship You, 
 I love You, Lord, always. 
 So thankful, Lord, You saved my life, 
 You saved my life, today. 
 
[C]
 Let me be a shining light for You, 
 Let me be a joy to You always.
 Let me be a shining light for You, 
 Let me be a joy to You always. 
 
[V2]
 And Lord, I love to bring to You
 The honour due Your name;
 Just look at what You've done for me,
 I'll never be the same.
