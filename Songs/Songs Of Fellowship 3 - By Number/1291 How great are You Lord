[V1]
 How great are You, Lord,
 How great is Your mercy,
 How great are the things
 That You have done for me.
 How great are You, Lord,
 Your loving kindness
 Is filling my heart as I sing,
 How great are You, Lord.
 
[V2]
 How great is Your love,
 It reaches to the heavens;
 How great is the heart
 That sought and rescued me.
