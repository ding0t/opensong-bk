[V1]
 We see the Lord, 
 And He is high upon the throne,
 And His glory fills the heavens and the earth.
 One like a Lamb 
 Who was slain is on the throne,
 And so I cast my crown before You 
 And bow down to praise.
 
[V2]
 For everything cries holy.
 Oh, everything cries holy.
 Oh, everything cries holy to You, Lord. 
 (repeat)
