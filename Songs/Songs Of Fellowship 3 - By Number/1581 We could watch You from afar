[V1]
 We could watch You from afar,
 And forever be amazed
 At how glorious You are.
 Yet You've drawn us close to You,
 Where the wonder's greater still,
 And You overwhelm us, God.
 
[C]
 And we rejoice with trembling in our hearts,
 Bring You a song of reverence and love.
 Jesus, how good, how great You are,
 And we rejoice with trembling
 Before Your throne.
 
[V2]
 Who could fully voice the praise
 Of the God of endless days,
 Tell a fraction of Your worth?
 For we only sing in part
 Of the grace of who You are;
 Just an echo, just a glimpse.
