[V1]
 God of mercy, hear our cry, 
 Turn Your hand today.
 Bring relief from their pain,
 Be their comfort.
 ||And every day they're given breath,
 Give them strength to live.
 And as their weary bodies fail,
 Fighting is over, flesh gives way,
 Be their light to guide them home.
 
[V2]
 God of mercy, hear our cry,
 Heal their souls today.
 Give them peace from their fears,
 Be their hope, Lord.
 ||And every day they're given breath,
 Give them strength to live.
 And as their weary bodies fail,
 Fighting is over, flesh gives way,
 Be their star to guide them home.
 
[V3]
 Sometimes I don't know what to ask for,
 Sometimes I don't know what to say,
 But I know that You are watching over them.
 ||Sometimes I don't know what to pray for,
 Sometimes I don't know how to give,
 But I know that You are watching over them,
 And their life is not in vain.
