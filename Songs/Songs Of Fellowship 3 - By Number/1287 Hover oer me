[V1]
 Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,
 Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
 Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
 Come, O come and fill me now.
 
[C]
 Fill me now, fill me now,
 Jesus, come and fill me now.
 Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
 Jesus, come and fill me now.
 
[V2]
 Thou can fill me, gracious Spirit,
 Though I cannot tell Thee how;
 But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
 Come, O come and fill me now.
 
[V3]
 I am weakness, full of weakness,
 At Thy sacred feet I bow;
 Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
 Come with power, and fill me now.
