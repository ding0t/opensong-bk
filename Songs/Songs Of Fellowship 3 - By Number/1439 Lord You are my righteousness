[V1]
 Lord, You are my righteousness,
 The One who sanctifies my life,
 My Shepherd and my guide.
 Banner of deliverance,
 Warrior and my defence,
 In Your secret place I hide.
 ||Every other throne must fall
 And proclaim You Lord of all
 At the mention of Your name;
 My salvation and my light,
 In Your presence I abide
 And Your righteousness I claim.
 
[C]
 Jesus, Jesus,
 Jesus, Jesus.
 
[V2]
 Though You are the King of kings,
 Yet You are my next of kin,
 And my nearest friend.
 Laying down Your life for me,
 Your amazing grace I see,
 And Your love without an end.
 ||How can I keep silent, Lord?
 Even stones obey Your word
 And they give to You their praise.
 You're the Lord of everything,
 All creation's voices sing 
 Of the glory of Your name.
