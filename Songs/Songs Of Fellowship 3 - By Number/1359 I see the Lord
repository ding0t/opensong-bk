[V1]
 I see the Lord, 
 And He is high and lifted up,
 And His train fills the temple.
 I see You, Lord,
 And You are high and lifted up,
 And Your train fills the temple.
 
[C]
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord,
 Holy is the Lord most high.
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord,
 Holy, is the Lord most high.
 
[V2]
 I see Your holiness,
 And light surrounds Your throne;
 Who am I to come before You?
 But now my guilt is gone,
 My sins are washed away,
 Through Your blood I come.
 
[V3]
 Who am I that I should gain the Father's love?
 Now my eyes have seen the King.
 Touch my lips that I may tell of all You've done:
 Fill my heart I cry,
 Be glorified!
