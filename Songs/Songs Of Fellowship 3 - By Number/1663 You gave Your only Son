[V1]
 You gave Your only Son,
 Came down from heaven above,
 Endured the cross, so I might know
 This love that reached for me,
 A love that sets me free,
 Your sacrifice has saved my soul.
 
[V2]
 Today I'm reminded of Your grace;
 Always living now to sing Your praise,
 Your praise.
 
[C]
 Praise You, Jesus, I praise You,
 I lift my hands and sing.
 Embrace You, I will embrace You,
 My Saviour and my King, my King.
 
[V3]
 I could not earn this love,
 Such undeserved love;
 Jesus, I know You are the way.
 You paid the price for me,
 Your blood was shed for me,
 And in Your mercy took my place.
