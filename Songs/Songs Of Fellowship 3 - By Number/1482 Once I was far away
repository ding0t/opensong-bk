[V1]
 Once I was far away,
 But now my life is found in You.
 Once I was without hope,
 But now I have a vision of heaven.
 
[V2]
 Fallen from grace;
 By faith lifted up;
 Now I believe 
 
[C]
 No height, no depth can keep us 
 From the love of Christ.
 No life, no death, no trial 
 Can tear us from 
 The love of God in Christ.
 
[V3]
 How wonderful the love
 Our Father God has given us,
 That we could still be called
 Children of God.
