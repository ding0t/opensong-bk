[V1]
 What wisdom once devised the plan
 Where all our sin and pride
 Was placed upon the perfect Lamb 
 Who suffered, bled and died?
 The wisdom of a sovereign God
 Whose greatness will be shown,
 When those who crucified Your Son
 Rejoice around Your throne.
 
[C]
 And oh, the glory of the cross,
 That You would send Your Son for us.
 I gladly count my life as loss
 That I might come to know
 The glory of, the glory of the cross.
 
[V2]
 What righteousness was there revealed
 That sets the guilty free,
 That justifies ungodly men
 And calls the filthy clean?
 A righteousness that proved to all
 Your justice has been met,
 And holy wrath is satisfied
 Through one atoning death.
 
[V3]
 What mercy now has been proclaimed
 For those who would believe?
 A love incomprehensible,
 Our minds could not conceive.
 A mercy that forgives my sin
 And makes me like Your Son.
 And now I'm loved forevermore,
 Because of what You've done.
