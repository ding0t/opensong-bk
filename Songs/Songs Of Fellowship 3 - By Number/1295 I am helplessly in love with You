[V1]
 I am helplessly in love with You.
 I am lost in something precious.
 I am drowning in the sea of You.
 I am found amongst Your treasures.
 
[V2]
 And I don't know why You give Yourself,
 And I can't explain why You should care.
 When all heaven sings Your glory,
 I'm humbled that You hear my prayer.
 
[C]
 I can only give my heart to You,
 I can only give my heart.
 I can only give my heart to You,
 I can only give my heart.
 
[V3]
 I am helplessly devoted to You;
 I am scorched by strange new fire.
 I am running deeper into You.
 I am high upon the wire.
 
[V4]
 It's like breathing some strange new air,
 Walking on some distant moon.
 I'll sing a song from the depths of my soul:
 Seeking, finding, coming home.
 Seeking, finding, coming home.
