[V1]
 My friend and King,
 Love sweeter than a rose;
 You meet me where I am.
 What can I do
 But bow down on my knees?
 Your beauty blows my mind.
 
[C]
 Lord, I will call only to You,
 For You deserve the highest praise.
 And I will live only for You,
 For You deserve the highest praise.
 
[V2]
 To be with You
 Is all that I desire;
 Lord, may You shine in me.
 You gave me life
 And sacrificed Your own;
 Who else would die for me?
