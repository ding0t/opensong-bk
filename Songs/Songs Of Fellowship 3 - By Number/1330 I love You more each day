[V1]
 I love You more each day,
 With all my heart can give;
 Worship at Your feet,
 Lost within Your gaze.
 ||Just to know that You're near,
 My treasure is here,
 That You gave Your life
 To save me;
 How my heart sings with praise
 And calls on Your name,
 My Saviour, my Lover, my King, 
 Come to me again!
