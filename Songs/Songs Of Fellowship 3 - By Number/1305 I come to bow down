[V1]
 I come to bow down,
 I come to hear You speak.
 I wait before You
 Where deep can call to deep.
 
[C]
 Be my life, be my all;
 Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.
 
[V2]
 My heart will praise You;
 In praises You dwell.
 I long to be with You
 And come away with You.
 
[V3]
 Wonder of heaven, joy of my heart;
 Strength of my being, I love You.
 Rock of salvation, love of my life;
 God of all comfort, draw near.
 
[V4]
 Heart and soul I seek You, Lord;
 Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.
