[V1]
 O Lord, I am devoted to You,
 All that I am I give You,
 Nothing do I withhold.
 I am nothing without You,
 All my hope is upon You,
 Simply telling You I am Yours,
 I am Yours.
 
[C]
 Jesus, may my devotion be pleasing,
 Expressed through this song I am singing,
 Pouring my heart out to You, only You.
 ||You are the reason for living, I'm breathing:
 My refuge, my strength and my healing,
 So I give my heart unto You, 
 Only You.
 
[V2]
 Every earthly distraction
 Fades away to the background,
 I'm content just to be with You.
 Jesus, You satisfy my longing,
 To You do I cry, I'm coming,
 Kneeling before Your throne,
 At Your throne.
