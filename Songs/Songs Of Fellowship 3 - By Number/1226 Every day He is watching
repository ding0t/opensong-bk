[V1]
 Every day He is watching
 From the heavens and the skies.
 And He scans the horizon,
 Looking for the sign
 Of a son or a daughter 
 With a prodigal heart,
 Coming back to the Father of life.
 
[V2]
 And the Shepherd is searching
 For the sheep who's gone astray,
 Though there's ninety and nine safe,
 At the closing of the day.
 His pursuit is relentless,
 His obsession divine;
 It's the heart of the Father of life.
 
[C1]
 Oh, His compassion is for everyone.
 Yes, for the lost and the afraid.
 And if you listen you can hear His voice,
 Hear Him calling, 
 Hear Him calling your name.
 
[V3]
 Have you seen my belov√®d?
 He is radiant and most fair.
 In the evening He calls me,
 I can see His shadow there.
 I will rise up to meet Him,
 I will run to His side;
 To the Son of the Father of life.
 
[C2]
 Oh, Your compassion is for everyone.
 Yes, for the lost and the afraid.
 And if I listen I can hear Your voice,
 Hear You calling, 
 Hear You calling my name.
