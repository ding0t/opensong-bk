[V1]
 What a day to be alive,
 What a time to live my life,
 To have a destiny and call,
 And see it day by day unfold.
 ||What a day to know You, Lord,
 To live and walk within Your love,
 To see the wondrous things You've done,
 And know there's greater things to come.
 
[V2]
 And we sense the wonder of it all,
 We feel the urgency;
 There's not a day to be wasted.
 God, help Your church, help us to see.
 
[C]
 This is our time, this is our day;
 Now's not the time to hold back or delay.
 Dreams can live again,
 Faith and hope restored.
 ||Taste and see that the Lord is good;
 This is the day of salvation,
 A time to break free from containment.
 People need, people need the Lord.
