[V1]
 You are my foundation,
 You are my salvation,
 A very present help in times of need.
 You are my protection,
 You are my resurrection,
 A higher place is where You're taking me.
 
[V2]
 I get lifted up on eagles' wings,
 You lift me up and so I sing:
 
[C]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah to the King.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah to the King.
 
[V3]
 You are my Redeemer, 
 You are my Healer,
 A promise given, one of liberty.
 You are my Restorer,
 You are my strong tower,
 The joy of the Lord will be my strength.
