[V1]
 We will seek Your face, Almighty God, 
 Turn and pray for You to heal our land. 
 Father, let revival start in us, 
 Then every heart will know Your kingdom come. 
 
[C]
 Lifting up the name of the Lord
 In power and in unity, 
 We will see the nations turn, 
 Touching heaven, changing earth,
 Touching heaven, changing earth. 
 
[V2]
 Never looking back, we'll run the race;
 Giving You our lives, we'll gain the prize.
 We will take the harvest given us,
 Though we sow in tears, we'll reap in joy.
 
[V3]
 Send revival, send revival, 
 Send revival to us.
 Send revival, send revival, 
 Send revival to us.
