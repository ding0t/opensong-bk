[V1]
 Here I am, O God,
 I bring this sacrifice,
 My open heart, I offer up my life.
 I look to You, Lord,
 Your love that never ends
 Restores me again.
 
[V2]
 So I lift my eyes to You, Lord,
 In Your strength I will break through, Lord.
 Touch me now, let Your love fall down on me.
 ||I know Your love dispels all my fears.
 Through the storm I will hold on, Lord,
 And by faith I will walk on, Lord,
 Then I'll see beyond my Calvary one day,
 And I will be complete in You.
