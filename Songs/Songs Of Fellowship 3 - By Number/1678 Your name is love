[V1]
 Your name is love, 
 The love that went to the cross. 
 Your name is peace, 
 You've taken my sins away, 
 And how I love all that You are, 
 Your name is Jesus. 
 
[V2]
 Your name is truth,
 The truth that sets me free.
 Your name is hope,
 Hope for eternity,
 And how I love all that You are,
 Your name is Jesus.
 
[C]
 Jesus, Name above all names, 
 I will ever more proclaim:   
 'Worthy is the Lamb 
 To receive all power, 
 To receive all praise.' 
 
[V3]
 Your name is Lord,
 I gladly bow the knee.
 You are a friend,
 A friend of sinners like me,
 And how I love all that You are,
 Your name is Jesus.
