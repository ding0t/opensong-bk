[V1]
 Your voice is the voice that 
 Commanded the universe to be.
 Your voice is the voice that 
 Is speaking words of love to me:
 How can it be?
 
[C]
 Awesome God, holy God,
 I worship You in wonder.
 Awesome God, holy God,
 As You draw near I'm humbled 
 By Your majesty, and the mystery 
 Of Your great love for me.
 
[V2]
 Your arms are the arms that
 Hung shining stars in deepest space.
 Your arms are the arms that
 Surround me in a warm embrace:
 Amazing grace.
