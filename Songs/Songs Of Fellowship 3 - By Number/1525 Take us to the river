[V1]
 Take us to the river,
 Take us there in unity to sing
 A song of Your salvation
 To win this generation for our King.
 ||A song of Your forgiveness,
 For it is with grace that river flows;
 Take us to the river
 In the city of our God.
 
[V2]
 Take us to Your throne room,
 Give us ears to hear the cry of heaven;
 For that cry is mercy,
 Mercy to the fallen sons of man:
 ||For mercy it has triumphed,
 Triumphed over judgement by Your blood;
 Take us to the throne room
 In the city of our God.
 
[C]
 For the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us:
 This is the year of the Lord.
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,
 This is the year of the Lord.
 
[V3]
 Take us to the mountain,
 Lift us in the shadow of Your hands;
 Is this Your mighty angel,
 Who stands astride the ocean and the land?
 ||For in his hand Your mercy
 Showers on a dry and barren place;
 Take us to the mountain 
 In the city of our God.
