[V1]
 I will love You for the cross,
 And I will love You for the cost:
 Man of sufferings, 
 Bringer of my peace. 
 ||You came into a world of shame,
 And paid the price we could not pay:
 Death that brought me life, 
 Blood that brought me home. 
 Death that brought me life, 
 Blood that brought me home. 
 
[C]
 And I love You for the cross, 
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery. 
 I love You for the cost, 
 That Jesus, You would do this for me. 
 ||When You were broken, You were beaten, 
 You were punished, I go free.
 When You were wounded and rejected, 
 In Your mercy, I am healed. 
 
[V2]
 Jesus Christ, the sinner's friend;
 Does this kindness know no bounds?
 With Your precious blood
 You have purchased me.
 ||O the mystery of the cross,
 You were punished, You were crushed;
 But that punishment 
 Has become my peace.
 Yes, that punishment 
 Has become my peace.
