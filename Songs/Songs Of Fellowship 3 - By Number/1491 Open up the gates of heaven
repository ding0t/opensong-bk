[V1]
 Open up the gates of heaven.
 Open up the gates of heaven.
 Open up the gates of heaven.
 Open up the gates of heaven,
 
[V2]
 And let Your river flow,
 And let new mercies fall like rain;
 Oh, let me know Your presence.
 You are all I need;
 Let all earthly passion fade away,
 
[C]
 ('Cause) all I want is to know You more.
 All I want is to meet with You in this place.
 All I want is to be with You,
 To feel Your embrace.
