[V1]
 I know You love an offering 
 That's costly, outreaching, 
 Touching Your heart for the poor. 
 The songs we sing as our offerings 
 Are more fragrant in Your presence, 
 If we live a life of love. 
 
[C]
 And as we follow Your heart, 
 We are led to the lost, 
 Finding there a place of praise, 
 No matter what the cost. 
 So we will stand with the weak, 
 Give our most to the least, 
 Serving You with all we have, 
 Your kingdom, God, we seek. 
 
[V2]
 Now I see what You command:
 Be faithful and humble, 
 Putting selfish hopes aside,
 So change my heart that I may love 
 My neighbour as my brother, 
 And to live a life of love.
