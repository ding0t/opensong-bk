[V1]
 In the shadow of the cross,
 Let everything fall into place again.
 Jesus Christ, my sacrifice,
 How I need to find Your grace again.
 
[C]
 And nothing I can do
 Could add to all You've done,
 So let my soul be satisfied.
 As I receive Your favour,
 I will overcome.
 So in my life be glorified.
 
[V2]
 Jesus Christ, my perfect Priest,
 How You understand my weaknesses.
 Thank You for Your gift to me:
 Through Your sufferings I now 
 Possess this peace.
