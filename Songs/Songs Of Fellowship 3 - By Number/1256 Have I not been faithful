[V1]
 Have I not been faithful to You, Lord?
 Have I not offered up my prayers
 And tried to follow Your word?
 Lord, will You search me,
 Show me where I'm wrong?
 
[C]
 I've been waiting for the blessing
 For far too long,
 I've been waiting for the blessing
 For far too long.
 
[V2]
 Now Lord, forgive me,
 For speaking this right out.
 But I see the wicked prosper
 While the godly go without.
 No, I can't read human hearts,
 But do You know where I'm coming from?
 
[V3]
 Do not be angry with me, O my God,
 Please don't hide Your face away.
 I'm like a child, and I'm down on my knees
 And I'm begging for You
 Just to bless me today.
 
[V4]
 Lord, up ahead You know
 I see a lonely road.
 Got this burden on my back,
 It's such a heavy load.
 These days I've questions,
 But there's no answers in my songs.
