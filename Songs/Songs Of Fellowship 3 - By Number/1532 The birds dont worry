[V1]
 The birds don't worry,
 The flowers don't fret,
 The trees don't hurry 
 For the food they get;
 For God looks after 
 The things He's made:
 They can depend on Him.
 
[C]
 So don't you worry 'bout the things you need,
 For clothes to wear or for food to eat;
 But seek His kingdom and the rest will come:
 You can depend on Him.
 
[V2]
 The hills don't grumble,
 The stars don't cry,
 The sun doesn't tumble 
 From the big, blue sky;
 For God has set everything in place:
 They can depend on Him.
 
[C2]
 You can't live longer by worrying more,
 You can't get taller than you were before;
 So seek His kingdom and the rest will come:
 You can depend on Him.
