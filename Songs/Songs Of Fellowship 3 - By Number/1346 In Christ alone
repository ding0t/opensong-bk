[V1]
 In Christ alone my hope is found,
 He is my light, my strength, my song;
 This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
 ||What heights of love, what depths of peace,
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
 My Comforter, my All in All,
 Here in the love of Christ I stand.
 
[V2]
 In Christ alone! - who took on flesh, 
 Fullness of God in helpless babe! 
 This gift of love and righteousness, 
 Scorned by the ones He came to save: 
 ||Till on that cross as Jesus died, 
 The wrath of God was satisfied – 
 For every sin on Him was laid; 
 Here in the death of Christ I live.
 
[V3]
 There in the ground His body lay, 
 Light of the world by darkness slain: 
 Then bursting forth in glorious Day 
 Up from the grave He rose again! 
 ||And as He stands in victory 
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me, 
 For I am His and He is mine – 
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
 
[V4]
 No guilt in life, no fear in death, 
 This is the power of Christ in me; 
 From life's first cry to final breath, 
 Jesus commands my destiny.
 ||No power of hell, no scheme of man, 
 Can ever pluck me from His hand; 
 Till He returns or calls me home, 
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!
