[V1]
 God is our Father in heaven above,
 And He cares for His children with infinite love.
 Our worries are needless; look up in the sky
 Where carefree and singing the birds freely fly.
 ||Their Maker who knows them,
 Supplies all their food;
 How much more is our Father 
 Concerned for our good?
 
[C]
 For our Father in heaven 
 Knows all of our needs;
 He will care for us always.
 We surrender our all,
 And make the kingdom of heaven our goal.
 
[V2]
 Look at the lilies and see how they grow:
 They are clothed by God's goodness in beautiful show.
 Our Father in heaven who cares for each flower,
 Provides for us always, so great is His power.
 ||The kingdom of heaven
 And His righteousness
 We will seek with a passion
 So all may be blessed.
