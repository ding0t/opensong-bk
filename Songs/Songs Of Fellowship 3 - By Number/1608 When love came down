[V1]
 When love came down to earth
 And made His home with men,
 The hopeless found a hope,
 The sinner found a friend.
 Not to the powerful
 But to the poor He came,
 And humble, hungry hearts
 Were satisfied again.
 
[C]
 What joy, what peace has come to us!
 What hope, what help, what love!
 
[V2]
 When every unclean thought,
 And every sinful deed
 Was scourged upon His back
 And hammered through His feet.
 The Innocent is cursed,
 The guilty are released;
 The punishment of God
 On God has brought me peace.
 
[V3]
 Come lay your heavy load
 Down at the Master's feet;
 Your shame will be removed,
 Your joy will be complete.
 Come crucify your pride,
 And enter as a child;
 For those who bow down low
 He'll lift up to His side.
