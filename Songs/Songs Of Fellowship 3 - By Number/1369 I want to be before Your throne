[V1]
 I want to be before Your throne,
 Where Your glory shines.
 I want to see, I want to know
 The One who saved my life.
 
[C]
 I want to know the One who shines,
 The One enthroned above the skies,
 The One who gave His life,
 Was crucified, and lifted up on high.
 
[V2]
 I want to know as I am known
 In this space and time.
 Now I am Yours, and in lover's words:
 Jesus, You are mine.
 
[V3]
 In You I live, in You I move
 And have my being.
 It's You I love,
 It's You I choose to believe in.
