[V1]
 There is a deeper love to know,
 There is a higher place where we can go.
 There is a freedom at the cross,
 There is a light that shines for all the world.
 
[V2]
 And I can't hold this joy inside,
 I'm jumping in Your arms of mercy.
 
[C]
 Everybody sing, everybody shout,
 For the joy of the Lord
 Is our strength forever.
 Hey, everybody sing, everybody shout,
 For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
 
[V3]
 There is a brighter day to come,
 When all the world will bow down to Your Son.
 And all the broken will rejoice,
 Even the kings will say, 'You are the Lord'.
 
[V4]
 And we can't hold this joy inside,
 We're dancing in Your arms of mercy.
