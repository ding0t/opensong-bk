[V1]
 How shall I find my place of rest,
 True wisdom and the hand of God?
 Not by my own understanding,
 But by Your Spirit in me.
 
[V2]
 How shall I know the kind of love
 That cannot fade, that cannot fail?
 Not from this world's empty treasure,
 But by the promise of God.
 
[C]
 For You are the strength in my heart,
 So faithful when other loves fail me.
 Forever the strength in my heart:
 Jesus, Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Your river flows, it covers me,
 Its blessing fills my life always,
 And sets my eyes on Your beauty
 And fills my heart with a song.
