[V1]
 Jesus, Redeemer,
 Friend and King to me.
 My refuge, my comfort,
 You're everything to me.
 And this heart is on fire for You,
 Yes, this heart is on fire for You.
 
[C]
 For You alone are wonderful,
 You alone are Counsellor,
 Everlasting Father, 
 Mighty in the heavens.
 Never to forget the love 
 You displayed upon a cross,
 Son of God, I thank You,
 Prince of Peace, I love Your name.
 
[V2]
 Saviour, Healer,
 Just and true are You.
 Now reigning in glory,
 Most high and living God.
 And this heart is in awe of You,
 Yes, this heart is in awe of You.
