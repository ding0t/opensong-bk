[V1]
 Who can compare with You, my Father;
 Loving and kind, faithful and true?
 When You forgive my heart that is broken,
 I gratefully sing my love to You.
 
[C]
 I worship You,
 I love You:
 All that I am 
 Sings this song of praise.
 
[V2]
 Here I will dwell in the arms of my Father,
 Knowing Your grace, hearing Your voice;
 Trusting Your word, feeling Your peace,
 Resting in You and in Your love.
 
[V3]
 And I abide in You,
 I abide with You.
