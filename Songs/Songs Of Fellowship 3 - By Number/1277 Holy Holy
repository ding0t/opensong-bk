[V1]
 Holy, Holy, holy, holy
 Is the Lord God Almighty.
 Holy, holy, holy, holy
 Is the song around the throne.
 Where the angels and the elders gather
 There in sweet assembly,
 Singing holy, singing holy 
 Is the Lord our God.
 
[V2]
 Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy
 Is the Lamb who was slain for me.
 Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy
 Is the song within my heart.
 I could choose to spend eternity
 With this my sole refrain:
 Singing worthy, singing worthy
 Is the Lord our God.
 
[C]
 The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light, 
 The King, the Great I Am.
 My life, my all, my every breath,
 The Rock on which I stand.
 
[V3]
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
 How You suffered and died for us.
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
 But that tomb is empty now.
 And I long to gaze upon Your throne
 And all Your risen glory:
 Singing Jesus, singing Jesus
 Is the Lord of all.
