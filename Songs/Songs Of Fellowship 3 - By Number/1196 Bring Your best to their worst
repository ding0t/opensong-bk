[C]
 (All)|
 Bring Your best to their worst,
 Bring Your peace to their pain,
 God of love, heal Your people.
 
[V1]
 (Leader)|
 That none who cry aloud may cry in vain:

[V2]
 (Leader)|
 That those who fear may never walk alone:

[V3]
 (Leader)|
 That those near death may see the light of day:

[V4]
 (Leader)|
 That guilty folk may find themselves forgiven:

[V5]
 (Leader)|
 That those who doubt may find a deeper faith:

[V6]
 (Leader)|
 That broken folk may know they will be whole:
