[V1]
 Drawn from every tribe,
 Every tongue and nation,
 Gathered before the throne.
 Casting down their crowns,
 They fall at His feet
 And worship the Lord alone.
 What a glorious sight,
 Dressed in robes of white,
 Washed by the blood of the Lamb.
 
[C]
 Singing praise and glory,
 Wisdom and thanks,
 Honour, power and strength 
 Be to our God, forever 
 And ever, amen.
 
[V2]
 We are those who follow,
 Through scenes of fiery trial,
 Drawing from wells of grace.
 Through the darkest valley
 From the depths of pain,
 We'll come to that holy place.
 We will overcome
 By looking to the Lamb
 And worshipping face to face.
 
[V3]
 Never will we hunger,
 We'll no longer thirst,
 There's shade from the heat of day.
 Led to springs of life,
 Jesus, our Shepherd,
 Will wipe every tear away.
 Our God upon the throne
 Will shelter all His own
 Who worship Him night and day.
 
[V4]
 All glory and honour and power to Jesus,
 All glory and honour and power to Jesus,
 Forever and ever and ever and ever, 
 Forever and ever and ever and ever,
 Amen, amen, amen.
