[V1]
 Prepare the way of the Lord,
 Prepare the way of the Lord.
 Prepare the way of the Lord,
 Prepare the way of the Lord.
 
[V2]
 Majestic in holiness,
 Awesome in glory,
 Doing wonders, this is our God.
 We will not be silenced 
 From speaking His word.
 We cry to the nations:
 
[V3]
 All authority is invested 
 In the name of Jesus,
 And at the sounding of that name,
 At the sounding of that name
 He will arise.
