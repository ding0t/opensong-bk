[V1]
 What love is this? The love of Jesus,
 That gave its all, that cost His life.
 Flesh torn by nails, life cruelly taken,
 The Father's Son, love's sacrifice.
 
[C]
 And I thank You, Lord, for loving me,
 And I lift my hands so gratefully.
 And I thank You, Lord, that I can be
 A child of Yours eternally.
 
[V2]
 You are my King, You are my Saviour,
 You'll always be a friend to me.
 Safe in Your arms now and forever
 Your love shines bright, my morning star.
 
[V3]
 Now let Your power rain down upon me;
 Such peace and joy cascading down.
 May Your love touch all those around me;
 I'll shine for You, I'll shine for You.
