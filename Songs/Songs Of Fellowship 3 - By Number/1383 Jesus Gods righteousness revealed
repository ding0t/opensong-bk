[V1]
 Jesus, God's righteousness revealed,
 The Son of Man, the Son of God, His kingdom comes.
 Jesus, redemption's sacrifice,
 Now glorified, now justified, His kingdom comes.
 
[C]
 And His kingdom will know no end,
 And its glory shall know no bounds,
 For the majesty and power 
 Of this kingdom's King has come.
 And this kingdom's reign,
 And this kingdom's rule,
 And this kingdom's power and authority,
 Jesus, God's righteousness revealed.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, the expression of God's love,
 The grace of God, the Word of God, revealed to us;
 Jesus, God's holiness displayed,
 Now glorified, now justified, His kingdom comes.
