[V1]
 Image of invisible God,
 Creator and Sustainer of all;
 The King who came to ransom my soul,
 Thank You for Your perfect love.
 
[V2]
 Holy One whom angels attend,
 Righteous King who calls me His friend;
 The Prince who offers peace without end,
 Thank You for Your perfect love.
 
[C]
 And it's You, O Lord,
 You're all that I could ask for,
 And in You, O Lord, I find the deepest joy:
 Fountain of life, ocean of mercy and peace.
 ||And it's You, O Lord,
 Who gives me strength to follow,
 And in You, O Lord, is grace for every day:
 Boundless in love, 
 Fullness of heaven on earth.
 
[V3]
 Therefore I will not be afraid,
 Though mountains fall and rivers may rage;
 I'm safe within the city You've made,
 Thank You for Your perfect love.
