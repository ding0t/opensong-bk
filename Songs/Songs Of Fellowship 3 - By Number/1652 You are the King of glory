[V1]
 You are the King of glory,
 You dwell in holiness.
 Your sceptre reaches for me
 And I approach Your throne:
 
[C1]
 To make my prayers known to You;
 Your heart of love is for me.
 With boldness I draw near 
 To Your throne, O God, 
 To Your throne.
 
[V2]
 You show Your favour to me,
 My faith just grows and grows.
 Nothing's too hard for my God,
 No prayer too hard for You.
 
[C2]
 I will make my prayers known TO yOU;
 Your heart of love is for me.
 With boldness I draw near 
 To Your throne, O God, 
 To Your throne.
