[V1]
 You take me by the hand,
 And though there are times I don't understand,
 Your love will never fail
 And my heart belongs to You.
 ||Even when the rain clouds break
 And the cold wind blows all around me,
 I will not be put to shame;
 Lord, my hope is in Your name.
 You will carry me on Your shoulders
 And lead me home.
 
[V2]
 Carry me over troubled waters,
 Carry me over stormy seas.
 When the skies are dark and heavy,
 By Your grace You'll carry me.
 ||Though the way can seem uncertain
 Because the time of change has come,
 You will carry me on Your shoulders
 And lead me home.
