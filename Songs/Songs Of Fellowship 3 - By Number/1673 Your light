[V1]
 Your light broke through my night,
 Restored exceeding joy.
 Your grace fell like the rain,
 And made this desert live.
 
[C]
 You have turned
 My mourning into dancing.
 You have turned
 My sorrow into joy.
 
[V2]
 Your hand lifted me up,
 I stand on higher ground.
 Your praise rose in my heart,
 And made this valley sing.
 
[V3]
 This is how we overcome.
 This is how we overcome.
 This is how we overcome.
 This is how we overcome.
 This is how we overcome.
 This is how we overcome.
 
[C2]
 You turned
 My mourning into dancing.
 You have turned
 My sorrow into joy.
