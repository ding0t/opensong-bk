[V1]
 If I seek You, I will find You,
 But I need to take the time.
 If I call You, You will answer,
 But I need to take the time.
 
[C]
 Give me a pure heart,
 Give me a pure heart,
 I'm calling to You.
 Give me a pure heart,
 Give me a pure heart,
 I'm longing for You.
 
[V2]
 If I listen, I will hear You,
 But I need to take the time.
 If I follow, You will lead me,
 But I need to take the time.
