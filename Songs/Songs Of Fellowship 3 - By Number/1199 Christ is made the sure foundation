[V1]
 Christ is made the sure foundation,
 Christ the Head and Cornerstone,
 Chosen of the Lord and precious,
 Binding all the church in one;
 Holy Zion&apos;s help for ever,
 And her confidence alone.
 
[V2]
 All within that holy city
 Dearly loved of God on high,
 In exultant jubilation
 Sing, in perfect harmony;
 God the One-in-Three adoring
 In glad hymns eternally.
 
[V3]
 We as living stones invoke You:
 Come among us, Lord, today!
 With Your gracious loving-kindness
 Hear Your children as we pray;
 And the fullness of Your blessing
 In our fellowship display.
 
[V4]
 Here entrust to all Your servants
 What we long from You to gain - 
 That on earth and in the heavens
 We one people shall remain,
 Till united in Your glory
 Evermore with You we reign.
 
[V5]
 Praise and honour to the Father,
 Praise and honour to the Son,
 Praise and honour to the Spirit,
 Ever Three and ever One:
 One in power and one in glory
 While eternal ages run.
