[C]
 From the rising of the sun,
 Even to its going down, 
 Shall Your name be great.
 Through all the earth, 
 Among the nations, we give You praise;
 Your name is high above
 All other gods.
 
[V1]
 Jesus, Lover of my soul,
 You alone are King, worthy of my praise.
 My worship I'll give to only One;
 O Lord, my heart I'll bring 
 When to You I come.
 
[V2]
 Holiness, Majesty and King,
 Let Your will be done 
 When we worship bring.
 Eternal, Your love will remain;
 Before Your throne we bow,
 With our voices sing.
