[V1]
 Opening our hearts to You,
 Focusing our eyes on You,
 Lifting up our hands to You,
 Singing out this song for You.
 Praises that will fill the skies,
 Raising You over our lives,
 Lifting up the Saviour high.
 
[C]
 We give You the highest praise,
 We give You the highest praise,
 We give You the highest praise,
 We give You the highest praise.
 
[V2]
 You are so amazing, Lord,
 A beautiful and mighty God,
 Compassionate and merciful,
 Glorious and powerful.
 King over the universe,
 Wonderfully in love with us,
 Passionate about the earth.
 
[V3]
 All glory, honour, worship, praise,
 With hands held high and voices raised,
 We offer up our hearts again to You.
 (Repeat)
