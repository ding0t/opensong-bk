[V1]
 Jesus, my passion in life is to know You.
 May all other goals bow down to
 This journey of loving You more.
 ||Jesus, You've showered Your goodness on me,
 Given Your gifts so freely,
 But there's one thing I'm longing for.
 Hear my heart's cry,
 And my prayer for this life.
 
[V2]
 Above all else, above all else,
 Above all else, give me Yourself.
