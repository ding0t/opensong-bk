[V1]
 I've come to meet with You, my God, 
 To bless Your heart, my King;
 To be with You, to know Your love, 
 To give an offering.
 
[C]
 And I will seek Your lovely face,
 Through the veil I'll come, 
 To love You in Your dwelling place, 
 To gaze upon Your throne. 
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Your grace and love have come to me,
 You've set this captive free.
 This child is Yours, You have redeemed
 For life eternally.
 
[V3]
 I know the punishment You took for me;
 Thank You, Saviour, for the cost, 
 That set me free, 
 That set me free.
