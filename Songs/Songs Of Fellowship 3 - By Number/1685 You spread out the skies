[V1]
 You spread out the skies 
 Over empty space,
 Said 'Let there be light' -
 To a dark and formless world
 Your light was born.
 
[V2]
 You spread out Your arms 
 Over empty hearts,
 Said 'Let there be light' -
 To a dark and hopeless world
 Your Son was born.
 
[V3]
 You made the world and saw that it was good,
 You sent Your only Son, for You are good.
 
[C]
 What a wonderful Maker, 
 What a wonderful Saviour.
 How majestic Your whispers, 
 And how humble Your love.
 With a strength like no other, 
 And the heart of a Father,
 How majestic Your whispers, 
 What a wonderful God.
 
[V4]
 No eye has fully seen 
 How beautiful the cross,
 And we have only heard 
 The faintest whisper of 
 How great You are.
