[V1]
 Beautiful Lord, wonderful Saviour, 
 I know for sure, all of my days are 
 Held in Your hand, 
 Crafted into Your perfect plan. 
 ||You gently call me into Your presence, 
 Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit. 
 Teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life 
 Through Your eyes. 
 
[V2]
 I'm captured by Your holy calling, 
 Set me apart. 
 I know You're drawing me to Yourself; 
 Lead me, Lord, I pray. 
 
[V3]
 Take me, mould me, use me, fill me; 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand. 
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me; 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand.
