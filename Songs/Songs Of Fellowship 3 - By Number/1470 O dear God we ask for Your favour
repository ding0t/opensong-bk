[V1]
 O dear God, we ask for Your favour, 
 Come and sweep through this place. 
 Oh, we desire You. 
 I just want to be with You, be where You are, 
 Dwell in Your presence, O God.
 Oh, I want to walk with You. 
 
[C]
 And I will climb this mountain, 
 And I step off the shore; 
 And I have chosen to follow, 
 And be by Your side forevermore. 
 
[V2]
 Tell me what You want me to do, Lord God, 
 Tell me what You want for my life. 
 It's Yours, O God, it's Yours. 
 Do Your will, have Your way, 
 Be Lord God in this place. 
 Oh, I want Your will to be done.
