[V1]
 With the choir of angels singing, 
 And the realm of heavenly hosts; 
 As those elders humbly bow, 
 I'd love to come to Your throne 
 With a simple song. 
 
[V2]
 With the living creatures speaking
 Praise and praise and praise again;
 With the company of heaven,
 I'd love to come to Your throne
 With a song of love.
 
[C]
 Hallelujah, Jesus, 
 Hallelujah, hallelu. 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, 
 Pouring out my heart to You. 
 
[V3]
 I would bring this praise like incense
 Rising to Your throne above,
 Fill the air with heart-filled songs 
 In harmony and melody 
 To the One I love.
 
[V4]
 And who can tell the adoration 
 That will rise up to Your throne? 
 Every knee that day shall bow 
 To the King of kings, 
 The Holy One, the only One. 
 We'll all be singing...
