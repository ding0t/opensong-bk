[V1]
 You led me to the cross,
 And I saw Your face of mercy
 In that place of love.
 ||You opened up my eyes
 To believe Your sweet salvation,
 Where I'd been so blind.
 Now that I'm living in Your all-forgiving love,
 My every road leads to the cross.
 
[C]
 Jesus, keep me near the cross,
 I won't forget the love You've shown.
 Saviour, teach me of the cross,
 I won't forget the love,
 I won't forget the love You've shown.
 
[V2]
 And there's an empty tomb,
 That tells me of Your resurrection
 And my life in You.
 ||The stone lies rolled away,
 Nothing but those folded grave clothes
 Where Your body lay.
 Now that I'm living as a risen child of God,
 My every road leads to the cross.
