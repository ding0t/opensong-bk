[V1]
 Be lifted up, be lifted up.
 As we bow down,
 Be lifted up.
 Be lifted up, be lifted up.
 As we bow down,
 Be lifted up.
 
[V2]
 Let the heavens rejoice,
 Let the nations be glad.
 Let the whole earth tremble,
 For You are God.
 Come and worship the Lord
 In the beauty of holiness.
 
[V3]
 As we bow down,
 Be lifted up.
 As we bow down,
 Be lifted up.
