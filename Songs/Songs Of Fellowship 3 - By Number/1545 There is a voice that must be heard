[V1]
 There is a voice that must be heard,
 There is a song that must be sung;
 There is a name that must be lifted high.
 There is a treasure more than gold,
 There is a King upon the throne;
 There is One whose praise will fill the skies.
 
[C]
 His name is Jesus, Friend of sinners,
 Jesus, Jesus, Friend of mine.
 
[V2]
 There is a peace that calms our fears,
 There is a love stronger than death;
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave.
 There is a Friend who won't let go,
 There is a heart that beats for you;
 There is one name by which we are saved.
 
[V3]
 When I was captive to my fears,
 You were the One who came to me,
 You set me free.
