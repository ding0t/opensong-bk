[V1]
 Before one ever came to be,
 All the days ordained for me
 Were written in Your book of days.
 You are the One who fashioned me,
 The One I praise continually,
 So perfect are Your ways.
 I will rejoice and be glad.
 And in all things I give thanks.
 
[V2]
 This is the day You have made, 
 I will rejoice, I will rejoice: 
 In You I boast. (in my God)
 This is the day You have made, 
 I will rejoice, I will rejoice: 
 In You I boast.
