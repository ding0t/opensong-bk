[V1]
 You pour out grace on the broken-hearted,
 And You lift the hope of the weary soul,
 And You stretch out Your hand 
 With Your loving mercy.
 ||You saw this heart that was lost and broken,
 And You felt the pain of my loneliness,
 And You befriended me 
 And restored my dignity.
 
[C]
 You alone revealed the love of God to me,
 And You alone have given everything for me;
 And You alone deserve the highest praise, Jesus.
 
[V2]
 You demonstrated the life of love to me,
 And how it was that You wanted me to live:
 Heart of compassion and hands of healing.
 ||I need Your Spirit to help accomplish this:
 Abundant grace and Your strength in weakness,
 And the steady hand of the Father holding me.
 
[V3]
 And You have given me great salvation,
 And You have given me hope eternal,
 And every day I will look to give You
 All the glory that's due Your name.
