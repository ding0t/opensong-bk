[V1]
 Love like a jewel has come down,
 Most precious gem 
 In heaven's crown.
 Love like a jewel has come down,
 The greatest treasure 
 That I have found.
 
[C]
 And I will seek after You,
 Forsake everything that is distracting me
 From this searching,
 And run to the place
 Where my heart only hears the beat
 Of Your love for this world.
 
[V2]
 Love like a jewel has come down,
 You walk with the hurting,
 You're a friend to the poor.
 Love like a jewel has come down,
 Our greatest treasure,
 Where hope can be found.
