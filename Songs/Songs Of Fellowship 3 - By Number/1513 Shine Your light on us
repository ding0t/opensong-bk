[C]
 Shine Your light on us
 That all may see Your goodness.
 Shine Your face on us
 That all may see Your glory.
 
[V1]
 Answer me when I call.
 You are my only prayer.
 When darkness is all around
 I know You will be there.
 
[V2]
 Many are asking,
 Who can show us something real?
 Longing for hope
 Beyond the pain of what they feel.
 So I will go down on my knees and say:
 
[V3]
 I wanna be close to You,
 That my life would tell Your story.
 I wanna be one with You,
 Changed by the light of Your glory.
