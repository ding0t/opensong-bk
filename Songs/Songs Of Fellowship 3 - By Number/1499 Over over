[V1]
 Over, over, 
 The joy of the Lord is running over.
 Over, over,
 The joy of the Lord is running over.
 
[V2]
 Let me tell you of the supernatural joy
 That You can find in Him,
 The man called Jesus.
 He'll take away the sorrow of this life
 That brings so much sadness,
 Give you overflowing joy
 That no man can ever, ever touch, yeah.
 
[V3]
 Weeping may endure;
 Joy comes in the morning.
 Weeping may endure;
 Joy comes!
