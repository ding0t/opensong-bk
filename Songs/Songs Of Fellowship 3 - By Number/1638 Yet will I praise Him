[C]
 Yet will I praise Him,
 I will lift my hands to my Creator.
 Yet will I praise Him,
 My Saviour and my God.
 Yet will I praise Him,
 I will put my trust in my Provider.
 Yet will I praise Him,
 Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.
 
[V1]
 Though the fig tree doesn't blossom
 And no ripened grapes appear,
 Though the harvest fails 
 And fields provide no food;
 ||I'll be joyful in my Saviour,
 The Lord who is my strength;
 He will keep my ways 
 And lead me in His truth.
 
[V2]
 When the night is overwhelming
 And the day is far from clear,
 When my heart is restless 
 For the peace of God;
 ||Let Your song, Lord, through the ages,
 Through the prophets You have given,
 Lift my mind and heart
 To gaze upon You, Lord.
 
[V3]
 Be the strength, Lord, in my weakness,
 Let Your song be in my night;
 Be my rock when all around is sinking sand.
 Be the light, Lord, in my darkness,
 Be the vision of my eyes:
 In my passing days 
 You are the great 'I Am'.
 
[C2]
 Lord, I will praise You,
 I will lift my hands to my Creator.
 Lord, I will praise You,
 My Saviour and my God.
 Lord, I will praise You,
 I will put my trust in my Provider.
 Yes, I will praise You,
 Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.
