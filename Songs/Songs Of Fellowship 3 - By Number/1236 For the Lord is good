[V1]
 For the Lord is good, 
 And His love endures forever; 
 He's a faithful God 
 To all generations. 
 For the Lord is good, 
 And His mercies will not fail us; 
 They are new each day, 
 O, lift your voice and say, 
 'The Lord is good!'
 
[V2]
 Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord. (Leader)
 Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord. (Echo)
 Your loving kindness fills our (Leader)
 Hearts to overflowing. (All)
 ||Songs of rejoicing and sweet praise, (Leader)
 Songs of praise! (Echo)
 They fill our hearts, (Leader)
 They fill our hearts, (Echo)
 They fill our days.  (All)
