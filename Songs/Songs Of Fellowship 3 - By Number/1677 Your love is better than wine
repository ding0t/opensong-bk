[V1]
 Your love is better than wine,
 Your name like sweetest perfume;
 Oh, that You would kiss me 
 With the kisses of Your mouth
 And draw me, draw me after You.
 ||I hear You whisper my name,
 And like a moth to the flame
 I fly into the fire of Your intimate love
 As You draw me, draw me after You. 
 
[C]
 Draw me after You, 
 Draw me after You, 
 Draw me after You, 
 And let us run together.
 (Repeat)
 
[C2]
 Jesus You're the One, (x3)
 That I will love forever.
 Jesus You're the One, (x3)
 That I will love forevermore.
 
[V2]
 So amazing, so divine,
 I am Yours and You are mine.
 For such love there are no words,
 'Cause loving You is heaven on earth.
