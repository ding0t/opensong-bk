[V1]
 I have come home, 
 I'm here again, 
 Worn feet and ragged heart. 
 Wasted my time, 
 Wandered from ways that are best. 
 I don't deserve from You 
 Mercy that falls anew every day:
 All I want is You.
 
[V2]
 You know my name, 
 Call me Your friend,
 You draw me to Your side.
 Though I have failed, 
 Fallen so far, still You care.
 Grace covers all my shame.
 Jesus, You took the blame, this is love:
 All I want is You.
 
[V3]
 I am restored,
 Where I belong,
 At one with You again.
 With all my heart
 I choose to walk in Your ways.
 Held in Your strong embrace,
 No one will take Your place in my heart:
 All I want is You.
