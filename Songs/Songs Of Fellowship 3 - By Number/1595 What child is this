[V1]
 What child is this, who, laid to rest
 On Mary's lap is sleeping:
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
 While shepherds watch are keeping?
 ||This, this is Christ the King,
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
 Haste, haste, to bring Him praise,
 The babe, the Son of Mary.
 
[V2]
 Why lies He in such mean estate,
 Where ox and ass are feeding?
 Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
 The silent Word is pleading.
 ||Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
 The cross be borne for me, for you.
 Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
 The babe, the Son of Mary.
 
[V3]
 So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
 Come, peasant, king, to own Him;
 The King of kings salvation brings,
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
 ||Raise, raise a song on high,
 The virgin sings her lullaby.
 Joy, joy for Christ is born,
 The babe, the Son of Mary.
