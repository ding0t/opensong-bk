[V1]
 I tremble in Your presence, 
 I am humbled that You came, 
 Yet I know it's all because I choose to praise You. 
 I recognise Your fragrance, 
 As Your glory fills this place; 
 All I'd planned to say means nothing now. 
 
[C]
 Oh, how I long for You. 
 Oh, how I long for You. 
 Oh, how I long for You, oh. 
 
[V2]
 I shiver in Your presence, 
 I am frozen by my shame.
 My heart is breaking more than I can stand it.
 Your radiance is blinding, 
 Yet You hug me like a friend,
 I am overcome by Your mercy again.
