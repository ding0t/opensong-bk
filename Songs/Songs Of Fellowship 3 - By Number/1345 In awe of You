[V1]
 In awe of You, we worship
 And stand amazed at Your great love.
 We're changed from glory to glory,
 We set our hearts on You, our God.
 
[C]
 Now Your presence fills this place,
 Be exalted in our praise.
 As we worship I believe 
 You are near.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 Blessing and honour
 And glory and power
 Forever, forever.
 (Repeat)
