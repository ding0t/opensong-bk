[V1]
 All glory, laud and honour
 To Thee, Redeemer, King,
 To whom the lips of children
 Made sweet hosannas ring.
 Thou art the King of Israel,
 Thou David&apos;s royal Son,
 Who in the Lord&apos;s name comest,
 The King and bless√®d One.
 
[V2]
 The company of angels
 Are praising Thee on high,
 And mortal men and all things
 Created make reply.
 The people of the Hebrews
 With psalms before Thee went;
 Our praise and prayer and anthems
 Before Thee we present.
 
[V3]
 To Thee before Thy passion
 They sang their hymns of praise;
 To Thee now high exalted
 Our melody we raise.
 Thou didst accept their praises;
 Accept the prayers we bring,
 Who in all good delightest,
 Thou good and gracious King.
 
[V4]
 All glory, laud and honour
 To Thee, Redeemer, King,
 To whom the lips of children
 Made sweet hosannas ring.
