[V1]
 I will never be the same
 Now my eyes are open wide.
 I have been forever changed
 Through the power of His blood.
 
[V2]
 I will triumph in the cross
 That my Saviour bore for me.
 I will stand with confidence
 Because of Jesus.
 I no longer fear the grave,
 I'm a child of His grace.
 I no longer feel ashamed,
 Because of Jesus.
