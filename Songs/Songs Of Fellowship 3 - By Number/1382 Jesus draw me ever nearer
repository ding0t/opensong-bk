[V1]
 Jesus, draw me ever nearer,
 As I labour through the storm.
 You have called me to this passage,
 And I'll follow, though I'm worn.
 
[C]
 May this journey bring a blessing,
 May I rise on wings of faith:
 And at the end of my heart's testing,
 With Your likeness let me wake.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, guide me through the tempest,
 Keep my spirit staid and sure.
 When the midnight meets the morning,
 Let me love You even more.
 
[V3]
 Let the treasures of the trial
 Form within me as I go.
 And at the end of this long passage,
 Let me leave them at Your throne.
