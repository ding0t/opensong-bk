[V1]
 Lamp unto my feet,
 Light unto my path,
 It is You, Jesus, it is You.
 This treasure that I hold,
 More than finest gold,
 It is You, Jesus, it is You.
 
[C]
 With all my heart, with all my soul,
 I live to worship You 
 And praise forevermore,
 Praise forevermore.
 Lord, every day I need You more,
 On wings of heaven I will soar 
 With You.
 
[V2]
 You take my brokenness,
 Call me to Yourself.
 There You stand, 
 Healing in Your hands.
