[V1]
 Falling, moving closer,
 Deep into You. 
 Feasting, drinking my fill, 
 Tasting of You. 
 
[V2]
 Waiting, listening, hoping 
 Here's where You are. 
 Craving, calling Your name, 
 I need You more. 
 
[C]
 I will hold on, 
 Hold through the fire, 
 Cling through the rain, 
 I long to hear You. 
 I need You here, 
 All that You are, 
 Only Your touch 
 Will satisfy me.
