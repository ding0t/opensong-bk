[C]
 It is good, it is good,
 It is good to give thanks to the Lord on high,
 To sing of Your faithfulness
 And loving kindness both day and night;
 ||To play on our instruments
 Sweet songs of praise for the things You do:
 It is good, it is good,
 It is good to give thanks to You.
 
[V1]
 For though the wicked
 Spring up like the grass and are everywhere,
 Soon they will perish;
 But all those planted in Your house
 Will grow without end.
 Sing it again!
 
[V2]
 For though we struggle
 And trials and troubles still come our way,
 You won't forsake us;
 Your word has told us
 Your promises will never end.
 Sing it again!
 
[V3]
 (Leader â€“ All)
 Why give Him praise? 
 (Because He is worthy.)
 Why should we sing? 
 (He loves you and me.)
 Why give Him thanks? 
 (Because He forgave us.)
 Why celebrate? 
 (Because we are free.)
 ||And when should we thank Him? 
 (In morning and evening.)
 In what circumstance? 
 (The good and the bad.)
 Is it always easy? 
 (No, it's not so easy.)
 But is it good? 
 (Yes, it's good, it is good, it is good.)
