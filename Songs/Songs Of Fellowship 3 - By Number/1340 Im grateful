[V1]
 I'm grateful for the way You look at me.
 I'm thankful that You don't give up.
 You're a friend who's smiled at me a thousand times.
 When I cause You pain, You bring me love.
 
[V2]
 I've found a place where I'm free.
 I'm dancing now, 'cause You love me.
 (You love me, You love me, You love me.)
 
[C]
 I love You, You know it's true.
 And all I want is to be close to You.
 
[V3]
 When I've done the worst,
 You've seen the best in me.
 I was running away, 
 But You brought some rest to me.
 My heart is Yours and I give it all to You.
 And when it's tough, I know You'll 
 Pull me through.
