[V1]
 When we turn our hearts to heaven
 And bow down,
 We'll see fathers and the children reconciled.
 We'll be the dreamers of Your dreams.
 We'll be the dreamers of Your dreams.
 
[V2]
 When Your fire falls from heaven,
 We will rend our hearts to You.
 We will tell it to our children,
 All the wonders You have done.
 And in every generation
 We will sing of Your great love.
 ||When Your fire falls from heaven
 We'll return to You again!
 We'll be the dreamers of Your dreams.
 We'll be the dreamers of Your dreams.
