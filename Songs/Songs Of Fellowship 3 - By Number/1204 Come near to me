[V1]
 Come near to me, as I come near to You;
 Pour out Your mercy and Your grace.
 I need Your love, I need Your tenderness;
 I'm longing for Your sweet embrace.
 
[C]
 My heart cries out for more of You, Lord;
 I'm so hungry for Your presence.
 Your love is water to my soul.
 I will be satisfied with You, Lord;
 You fulfil my deepest longing.
 Pour out Your Spirit once again.
 
[V2]
 Draw close to me, as I draw close to You.
 Release Your power from above.
 I'm dry and thirsty, Lord, come and fill me up;
 I'm waiting for Your touch of love.
 
[V3]
 I've felt Your presence, Lord,
 I've tasted of Your love.
 Now all I am cries out for more of You,
 I want more of You;
 More of Your Spirit poured from above,
 More of Your power, more of Your love.
