[V1]
 O God of love, I come to You again,
 Knowing I'll find mercy.
 I can't explain all the things I see,
 But I'll trust in You.
 ||In every moment You are there,
 Watching over, You hear my prayer.
 You go before me, You're behind me,
 Nothing's hidden from You.
 
[C]
 How good it is to be loved by You,
 How good it is.
 How good it is to be loved by You,
 How good it is.
 
[V2]
 O God of strength,
 Your hand is on my life,
 Bringing peace to me.
 You know my frame,
 You know how I am made,
 You planned all my days.
 ||Hand of mercy, hand of love,
 Giving power to overcome.
 If all beneath me falls away,
 I know that You are God.
 
[V3]
 Who can stand against us?
 In my weakness You are strong.
 Your word is everlasting,
 I will praise You, faithful One.
