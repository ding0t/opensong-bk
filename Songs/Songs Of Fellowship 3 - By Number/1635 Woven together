[V1]
 Woven together within the womb,
 Fearfully, wonderfully made;
 You know me better than I know myself,
 And still You look on with pleasure.
 ||Where can I go from Your Spirit, Lord?
 Where can I hide from Your gaze?
 Ocean to ocean and shore to shore,
 Your hand reaches out to guide me.
 
[C]
 It's all too wonderful
 For me to know;
 It's all too marvellous
 For me to attain.
 The care You show to those
 Who love Your name;
 It's all too wonderful,
 It's all too wonderful for me.
 
[V2]
 Lord, You have searched me, You know me well,
 For nothing is hidden from You;
 And even before there's a word on my tongue,
 You know it completely, Lord.
 ||How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God,
 How great is the depth of Your love;
 I know that You've numbered the sum of my days,
 I'll rest in Your perfect wisdom.
