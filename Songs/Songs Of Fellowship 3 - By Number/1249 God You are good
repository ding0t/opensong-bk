[V1]
 God, You are good, God, You are kind.
 God, You are sun, God, You are shine.
 God, You are truth, God, You are pure.
 You've melted my heart,
 And now I am Yours.
 
[C]
 I'm happy to be a friend of God.
 I'm happy that God's a friend to me.
 
[V2]
 You're bursting with love
 For the ones that You made.
 You're happy to bless
 Every one of their days.
 You humble the proud
 But You raise up the low.
 You cry for the lost
 But You eat with the poor.
 
[V3]
 And You love me so much
 That You weep for my pain,
 And You guide with Your touch.
 For it is not Your heart to see me fall,
 Or let my sin remain.
