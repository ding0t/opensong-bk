[V1]
 There is a passion deep in my heart
 To know You, Jesus.
 There is a hunger deep in my soul
 Only You can satisfy.
 I hear You calling, drawing me closer,
 I can't resist Your grace.
 Almighty power and love so free,
 Draw me to Your side.
 
[C]
 And I'm lifted into Your presence,
 Lifted into Your arms of love.
 Lifted into Your presence,
 Now has my soul found rest,
 Now has my soul found rest.
 
[V2]
 I see Your face,
 I feel Your touch;
 Receive Your love,
 I worship You.
 (Repeat)
