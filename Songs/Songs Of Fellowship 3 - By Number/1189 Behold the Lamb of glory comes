[V1]
 Behold the Lamb of glory comes,
 In majesty He rides.
 Behold the Lion of Judah comes,
 In majesty He rides.
 
[C]
 He rides in majesty, majesty He rides.
 He rides in majesty, majesty He rides.
 
[V2]
 Behold the Sun of Righteousness,
 On a white horse He rides.
 His cavalry is following Him,
 An army from on high.
 
[V3]
 And when the Lord goes to battle,
 Who can stand against His awesome might?
 
[V4]
 Let God arise
 And His enemies be scattered.
 Whoa, whoa.
 (Repeat)
 
[V5]
 The watchmen on the tower
 Are interceding for the land.
 The saints proclaim God's victory,
 He stretches forth His hand.
