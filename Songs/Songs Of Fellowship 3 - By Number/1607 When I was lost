[V1]
 When I was lost, You came and rescued me;
 Reached down into the pit and lifted me.
 O Lord, such love,
 I was as far from You as I could be.
 ||You know all the things I've ever done,
 But Jesus' blood has cancelled every one.
 O Lord, such grace
 To qualify me as Your own.
 
[C]
 There is a new song in my mouth,
 There is a deep cry in my heart,
 A hymn of praise to Almighty God - hallelujah!
 And now I stand firm on this Rock,
 My life is hidden now with Christ in God.
 The old has gone and the new has come - hallelujah!
 Your love has lifted me.
 
[V2]
 Now I have come into Your family,
 For the Son of God has died for me.
 O Lord, such peace,
 I am as loved by You as I could be.
 ||In the full assurance of Your love,
 Now with every confidence we come.
 O Lord, such joy
 To know that You delight in us.
 
[V3]
 Many are the wonders You have done,
 And many are the things that You have planned.
 How beautiful the grace that gives to us
 All that we don't deserve,
 All that we cannot earn,
 But is a gift of love.
