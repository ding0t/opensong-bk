[V1]
 O Lord, our Lord, Your name is great
 And greatly to be praised.
 In heaven and the universe,
 Your glory is displayed.
 Every knee must bow to You
 And every tongue confess:
 You are Lord, the Son of God,
 Risen from the dead.
 
[C]
 You're Jesus, Ruler of the universe.
 Majestic is Your name in all the earth.
 Kingdoms rise, kingdoms fall,
 You are still the Lord of all.
 Majestic is Your name
 Here on earth.
 
[V2]
 When I see the moon and stars
 Created by Your breath;
 Why did You consider me
 Worthy of Your death?
 When I was the guilty one
 You took away my shame:
 When I called, You hid me in
 The refuge of Your name.
