[V1]
 I'm working out what it means to follow Jesus,
 Adding up what it costs to follow Him;
 Counting the times that His love is multiplying,
 Realising He took away my sin.
 ||He's always in my memory;
 He'll never cancel what He's done for me.
 When I add it together I calculate
 Jesus is great, Jesus is great!
