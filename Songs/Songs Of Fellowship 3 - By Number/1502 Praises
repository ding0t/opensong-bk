[V1]
 Praises, 
 For all that You've done I'll sing praises, 
 For sending Your Son who would save me, 
 Pouring out grace at the cross 
 Where You died for me. 
 ||Mercies, 
 Through all of my life I've seen mercies, 
 Through hardship and strife You are with me, 
 By my side, You are good, 
 So good to me. 
 
[V2]
 Through Your death You brought me life, 
 Took my shame, clothed me in white. 
 
[C]
 Lord, here I am, amazed again, 
 That You would die to save a friend. 
 You clear my sin and pay the cost, 
 So on my knees I'll stay, 
 At the foot of the cross.
 
[V3]
 Worship, 
 Day after day I will worship,
 For glory and grace, and for goodness,
 With all of my life I will be Your living praise.
 ||And Jesus, 
 I'll always look unto Jesus,
 For guidance and strength and my focus,
 Trying to live how You want Your child to be.
