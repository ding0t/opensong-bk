[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of Glory died,
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 And pour contempt on all my pride.
 
[V2]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
[C]
 Oh, the wonderful cross,
 Oh, the wonderful cross
 Bids me come and die and find
 That I may truly live.
 Oh, the wonderful cross,
 Oh, the wonderful cross,
 All who gather here by grace
 Draw near and bless Your name.
 
[V3]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 That were an offering far too small.
 Love so amazing, so divine
 Demands my soul, my life, my all.
