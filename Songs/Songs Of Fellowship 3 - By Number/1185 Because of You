[C]
 Because of You, I can be free; 
 Because of You, I can be me. 
 Since that day when love broke through, 
 My life was changed because of You. 
 
[V1]
 You fill my heart with melody, 
 Salvation is my song. 
 The way was opened up for me 
 To know You as my God. 
 
[V2]
 So I will sing for joy, sing for joy, 
 Sing for joy to You. 
 Yes, I will sing for joy, sing for joy, 
 Sing for joy to You. 
 (Repeat)
