[V1]
 Look to the skies, there's a celebration,
 Lift up your heads, join the angel song,
 For our Creator becomes our Saviour,
 As a baby born!
 ||Angels, amazed, bow in adoration:
 'Glory to God in the highest heaven!' 
 Send the good news out to every nation
 For our hope has come.
 
[C]
 Worship the King - come, see His brightness;
 Worship the King, His wonders tell:
 Jesus our King is born today;
 We welcome You, Emmanuel!
 
[V2]
 Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
 Father for ever, the Prince of Peace:
 There'll be no end to Your rule of justice,
 For it shall increase.
 ||Light of Your face, come to pierce our darkness;
 Joy of Your heart come to chase our gloom;
 Star of the morning, a new day dawning,
 Make our hearts Your home.
 
[V3]
 Quietly He came as a helpless baby - 
 One day in power He will come again;
 Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour
 On the earth to reign.
 ||Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly:
 Now in my life let Your will be done;
 Live in my flesh by Your Spirit holy
 Till Your kingdom comes.
