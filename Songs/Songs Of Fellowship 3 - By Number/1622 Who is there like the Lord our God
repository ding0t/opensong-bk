[V1]
 Who is there like the Lord our God,
 Faithful beyond all compare?
 Glorious in such holiness
 With power to heal and to save.
 
[C]
 You shall be called the Saviour eternal,
 There is grace in Your heart, and Your name.
 And You shall be known through all generations
 As the hope for the life that receives.
 
[V2]
 Let heaven rejoice, You are wonderful;
 Creation sings out to Your praise.
 You are the Lord, You are beautiful;
 Each work of Your hand shall proclaim.
 
[V3]
 A love beyond reason, this gift of life;
 The mercy of God in Your sacrifice.
 The fountain of truth that can satisfy,
 And it's found in You, Jesus,
 And it's found in You, Jesus,
 And it's found in You, Jesus.
