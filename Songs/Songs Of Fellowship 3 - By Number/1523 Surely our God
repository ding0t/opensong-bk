[C]
 Surely our God is the God of gods,
 And the Lord of kings,
 The revealer of mysteries.
 (Repeat)
 
[V1]
 He changes the times and the seasons,
 He gives rhythm to the tides;
 He knows what is hidden
 In the darkest of places,
 Brings the shadows into His light.
 
[V2]
 I'll praise You always, my Father,
 You are Lord of heaven and earth.
 You hide Your secrets
 From the 'wise' and the learn√®d,
 And reveal them to this, Your child.
 
[V3]
 Thank You for sending Your only Son,
 We may know the mystery of God;
 He opens the treasures
 Of wisdom and knowledge
 To the humble, not to the proud.
