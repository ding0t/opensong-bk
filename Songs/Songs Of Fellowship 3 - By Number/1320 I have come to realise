[V1]
 I have come to realise
 The glory of the Lord resides
 In this jar of clay.
 And if my world is going to see
 The glory of the Lord revealed,
 Then my pride must break.
 ||Then the fragrance of Jesus
 Will be released,
 And the glory of God will be revealed
 In all my world.
 
[C]
 Jesus, let Your name 
 Be fragrant in me,
 Like perfume that's poured 
 From this vessel of clay.
 (Repeat)
 
[V2]
 And I will live all my days
 To be the praise, 
 And I will live all my days
 To be the praise of Your glory.
