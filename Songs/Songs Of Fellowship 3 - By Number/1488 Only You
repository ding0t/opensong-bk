[V1]
 Only You can replace
 Rags for riches pure as gold,
 And Your mercy saved my soul,
 There's none like You.
 
[V2]
 At Your name demons flee,
 Mountains tremble in Your sight,
 But You love me like a friend,
 There's none like You.
 
[C]
 Nothing compares to You,
 You're the One we love.
 Send down Your holy fire
 Over all the earth.
 (Repeat)
 
[V3]
 You have paid such a cost,
 So much more than can be won:
 God, You gave Your only Son,
 There's none like You.
 
[V4]
 So we'll bow to the cross
 Where the tears of heaven fall.
 You have heard the sinner's call:
 There's none like You.
