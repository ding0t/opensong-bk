[V1]
 How good You have been to me,
 Forever faithful.
 How true are Your promises,
 Never shaken.
 You are the Light of my life,
 You are the reason I live.
 
[C]
 I live for You,
 I place no one above You.
 I'll walk with You always, always.
 To talk with You,
 And feel Your breath on my face,
 How amazing,
 How amazing You are!
 
[V2]
 How rich is Your word, O Lord,
 At work within me.
 How soft is Your voice I hear,
 That gently calls me.
 Each day I wake to Your love;
 I know that I am blessed of God!
