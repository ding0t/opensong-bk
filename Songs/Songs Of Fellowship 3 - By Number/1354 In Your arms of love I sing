[V1]
 In Your arms of love I sing, 
 Giving glory to my King: 
 I have come to seek Your face 
 In this secret, secret place. 
 And I will bow before Your throne, 
 For my life is not my own. 
 
[C]
 And I will praise You, 
 Every day I'll come before Your throne. 
 I am holy unto You. 
 And I will give You 
 All my hopes, my dreams I lay them down.
 Lord, may I be found in You. 
 
[V2]
 I have taken up my cross,
 What was gain I've counted loss.
 Father, let Your will be done
 For I am broken by this love.
 Send Your fire to purify,
 Jesus, teach me how to die.
 
[V3]
 And I will follow You, my Lord, 
 Forevermore and ever more, 
 And I will follow You, my Lord, 
 Forevermore. 
 (Repeat)
