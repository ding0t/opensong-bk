[V1]
 You've placed a hunger in my heart 
 To see Your glory, 
 You've caused a thirst that I cannot ignore; 
 You've stirred a passion that will 
 Drive me to Your presence, 
 And I won't rest until
 You've heard me cry for more. 
 
[C]
 Come as a mighty torrent, 
 Come as a raging fire, 
 Come as a hurricane that drives 
 The heat of my desire. 
 Come in the smallest whisper, 
 Come as the quiet dew: 
 We don't care how You come, 
 As long as You come to us. 
 
[V2]
 Though people mock the church 
 And curse the One who made them,
 Your kingdom is advancing every day;
 Like living stones we're being 
 Built into a temple,
 We've seen the glory 
 And we cannot turn away.
 
[V3]
 Is this the summer that will 
 See a mighty harvest?
 A sense of expectation fills the air;
 Though sin abounds, 
 Your love is streaming to the nations,
 Let mercy triumph 
 Over judgement everywhere.
 
[C2]
 Come to the politician, 
 Come to the refugee,
 Come to the victim of respectable society;
 Come to the mighty fallen, 
 Come to the poor oppressed:
 We don't care how You come, 
 As long as You come to them.
