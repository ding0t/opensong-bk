[V1]
 At the foot of the cross
 Where I kneel in adoration,
 And I lay my burdens down
 I exchange all my sin
 For the promise of salvation,
 And Your name across my brow.
 
[V2]
 At the foot of the cross
 I give up my vain ambition,
 And I leave my selfish pride.
 In the peace that is there
 Will You restore my vision
 In all the places I am blind?
 
[C1]
 I will wait here at the cross.
 I will wait here at the cross.
 I will wait here at the cross.
 I will wait here at the cross.
 
[V3]
 At the foot of the cross
 There is healing for this nation,
 There is rest for those who wait;
 And the love that we find
 Is the hope of all creation,
 We are stunned by what You gave.
 
[C2]
 We will wait here at the cross.
 We will wait here at the cross.
 We will wait here at the cross.
 We will wait here at the cross.
 
[V4]
 We will wait at the cross,
 A hungry generation,
 With our broken hearts and lives.
 Will You hear, will You come,
 Will You fill our desperation?
 O God, let this be the time.
