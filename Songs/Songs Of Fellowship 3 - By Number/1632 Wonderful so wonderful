[V1]
 Wonderful, so wonderful 
 Is Your unfailing love;
 Your cross has spoken mercy over me.
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard, 
 No heart could fully know
 How glorious, how beautiful You are.
 
[C]
 Beautiful One, I love You,
 Beautiful One, I adore, 
 Beautiful One, my soul must sing.
 
[V2]
 Powerful, so powerful, 
 Your glory fills the skies,
 Your mighty works displayed for all to see.
 The beauty of Your majesty  
 Awakes my heart to sing
 How marvellous, how wonderful You are.
 
[V3]
 You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew,
 You captured my heart with this love,
 'Cause nothing on earth 
 Is as beautiful as You.
 (Repeat)
 
[V4]
 My soul, my soul must sing,
 My soul, my soul must sing,
 My soul, my soul must sing,
 Beautiful One.
