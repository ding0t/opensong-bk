[V1]
 Jesus, my desire, 
 I turn towards Your ways.
 Hungry for Your truth, 
 I'm here to seek Your face.
 
[V2]
 But in my weakness I cry out to You, only You,
 To be my strength when I am weak,
 And do as You do.
 
[C1]
 With You, it all seems so right.
 If the sun don't shine,
 There's light in Your eyes.
 With You, when mountains fall, 
 I stand on the Rock
 And I am safe in Your arms 
 When I'm with You,
 When I'm with You.
 
[V3]
 How can I stay pure?
 Oh, how can I stay true?
 By living out Your word 
 And dwelling in Your truth.

[C2]
 With You, it all seems so right.
 If the sun don't shine,
 There's light in Your eyes.
 With You, when mountains fall, 
 I stand on the Rock
 And I am safe in Your arms 
 When I'm with You,
 When I'm with You.
 Just to be with You.
