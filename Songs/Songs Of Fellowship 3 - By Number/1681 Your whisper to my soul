[V1]
 Your whisper to my soul 
 When I was like a child,
 Lifted off the yoke,
 Planted fields of hope 
 In this heart of mine.
 ||You took me as I am,
 You knew what I had done,
 Still You took my shame,
 And You called my name, 
 I was overcome.
 
[V2]
 When You broke the bonds 
 Of how I used to be,
 You rolled away the stone, 
 You set the captive free.
 
[C]
 I wanna thank You, 
 You're the God of mercy;
 I wanna thank You, Lord, 
 For giving me peace.
 I wanna thank You, 
 You're the God who loved me;
 I wanna thank You, 
 You're the God who rescued me.
 
[V3]
 You covered all my sin,
 Restored to me my youth again.
 And I am satisfied,
 For You have healed me 
 And redeemed me,
 Crowned my head with endless beauty,
 Endless beauty.
