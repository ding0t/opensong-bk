[V1]
 No longer just servants in the house of the King,
 The banquet is ready and You draw us in.
 ||You call us to eat with You and to be
 Your friends, those who love You,
 Your friends, those who know You.
 
[C]
 Oh, how can it be that I have become
 A friend of the King after all that I've done?
 A sinner in rags, now a child in Your care,
 You showed me the cross and I met You there.
 Your friend, one who loves You,
 Your friend, one who knows You.
 
[V2]
 A servant is trusted with some secret things,
 And so, how much more for the friend of a King.
 ||No eye has yet seen, and no ear has heard
 What You've prepared for those who love You,
 What You've prepared for those who love You.
 
[V3]
 And I'll sing a song for the One that I love,
 You captured my heart when I met with Your Son.
 ||And so I will live a life full of praise 
 For You, Lord and Shepherd,
 For You, Friend and King.
