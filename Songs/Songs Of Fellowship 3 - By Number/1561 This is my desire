[V1]
 This is my desire, to honour You:
 Lord, with all my heart I worship You.
 All I have within me, I give You praise:
 All that I adore is in You.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I give You my heart,
 I give You my soul;
 I live for You alone.
 Every breath that I take,
 Every moment I'm awake,
 Lord, have Your way in me.
