[V1]
 If we died with Christ, 
 We'll also live with Him,
 And if we endure, 
 We'll also reign with Christ.
 If we deny Him, He will disown us,
 But if we're faithless,
 Faithful He remains.
 
[C1]
 A faithful Saviour and unending in mercy 
 Is our God, the only true God.
 The suffering Servant,
 And our conquering Hero 
 Are You, God, forever true God.
 You are worthy to receive our lives.
 
[V2]
 If we please the Lord
 In this present world,
 We will inherit eternal life to come.
 For He has promised
 To raise us from the dead
 If we walk worthily of Christ the risen One.
 
[C2]
 A faithful Saviour and unending in mercy 
 Is our God, the only true God.
 The suffering Servant,
 And our conquering Hero 
 Are You, God, forever true God.
 You are worthy to receive our lives.
 Cleansed from sin and alive to Christ.
