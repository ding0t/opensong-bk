[V1]
 Almighty God,
 to whom all hearts are open,
 All desires known,
 And from whom no secrets are hidden:
 Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
 By the inspiration of Your Holy Spirit,
 ||That we may perfectly love You,
 And worthily magnify,
 That we may perfectly love You,
 And worthily magnify
 Your holy name;
 ||Through Christ our Lord,
 Amen.
 Through Christ our Lord,
 Amen.
