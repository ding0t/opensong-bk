  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Above all powers, above all kings,
 Above all nature and all created things;
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
 You were here before the world began.
 
[V2]
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
 Above all wonders the world has ever known;
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
 There's no way to measure what You're worth.
 
[C]
 Crucified, laid behind the stone;
 You lived to die, rejected and alone;
 Like a rose trampled on the ground,
 You took the fall and thought of me, 
 Above all.
