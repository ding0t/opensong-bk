[V1]
 Praise Him, You heavens
 And all that's above.
 Praise Him, you angels
 And heavenly hosts.
 Let the whole earth praise Him.
 ||Praise Him, the sun, moon
 And bright shining stars.
 Praise Him, you heavens
 And waters and skies.
 Let the whole earth praise Him.
 
[C]
 Great in power, great in glory,
 Great in mercy, King of heaven.
 Great in battle, great in wonder,
 Great in Zion, King over all the earth.
