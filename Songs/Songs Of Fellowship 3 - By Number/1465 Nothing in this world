[V1]
 Nothing in this world, 
 No treasure man could buy,
 Could take the place of drawing near to You.
 There's nothing I want more
 Than to spend my days with You,
 Dwelling in Your secret place of praise.
 
[C]
 And oh, how I need You.
 Jesus, I need You.
 You are the One that satisfies,
 You are the One that satisfies.
 
[V2]
 So place within my heart
 A fire that burns for You,
 That waters cannot quench
 Nor wash away.
 And let that fire blaze 
 Through all eternity,
 Where one day I shall see You face to face.
