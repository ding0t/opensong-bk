[V1]
 I am amazed 
 By the power of Your grace,
 I am amazed 
 That You took my sin and shame;
 Restoring hope, restoring dignity:
 Your grace covers me,
 Your grace covers me, oh.
 
[C]
 Saving grace, washing over me;
 Saving grace, that made a way for me:
 I was lost until You rescued me, 
 Your grace covers me.
 
[V2]
 I'm overwhelmed
 By Your love and goodness,
 I'm overwhelmed
 That You took my brokenness:
 Amazing love, how can this be?
 Your grace covers me,
 Your grace covers me.
