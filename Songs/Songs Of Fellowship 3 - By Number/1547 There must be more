[V1]
 There must be more than this:
 O Breath of God, come breathe within.
 There must be more than this:
 Spirit of God, we wait for You.
 Fill us anew, we pray;
 Fill us anew, we pray.
 
[C]
 Consuming fire, fan into flame
 A passion for Your name.
 Spirit of God, fall in this place.
 Lord, have Your way,
 Lord, have Your way with us.
 
[V2]
 Come like a rushing wind,
 Clothe us with power from on high.
 Now set the captives free;
 Leave us abandoned to Your praise.
 Lord, let Your glory fall;
 Lord, let Your glory fall.
