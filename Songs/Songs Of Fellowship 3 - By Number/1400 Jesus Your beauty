[V1]
 Jesus, Your beauty is filling this temple.
 Jesus, Your fragrance is drawing me closer,
 And with every step I take
 You lead me into this holy place,
 And it washes me clean,
 For my eyes have seen 
 Messiah.
 
[C]
 And I will jump into the holy river,
 I will lose myself to my Deliverer.
 I will jump into the holy river,
 I will lose myself to my Deliverer.
 In this holy place I can see Your face,
 Messiah.
 
[V2]
 Jesus, Your passion is filling this temple.
 Jesus, Your mercy is drawing me closer,
 And with every step I take
 You lead me into a world that aches,
 And I cannot rest till all eyes have seen 
 Messiah.
