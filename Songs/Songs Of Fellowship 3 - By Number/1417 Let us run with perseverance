[C]
 Let us run with perseverance
 The race set out before us;
 Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
 The Author and Perfecter of our faith.
 
[V1]
 In the beginning 
 The Word was with God,
 Through Him all of us were made;
 He began a work in us,
 A good work to perfect
 Until He returns again.
 
[V2]
 Since we are surrounded 
 By heaven's cheering crowd,
 Let us throw off every chain:
 For all that opposes us,
 Look to Jesus who endured
 So we'll not lose heart again.
 
[V3]
 For the joy before Him,
 He suffered the cross,
 He defeated death and shame;
 Now He reigns in glory
 At the right hand of God â€“
 He is calling us by name.
