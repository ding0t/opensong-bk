[V1]
 I am the one with the unclean lips,
 I am the one whose mind is jaded.
 I am the one with the impure heart,
 And all my innocence has faded.
 
[C]
 Wash me clean in Your river of mercy.
 Restore my soul by a clear blue stream.
 Wash me clean in Your river of mercy,
 Restore my soul, renew me again.
 
[V2]
 I am the one whose walk is faithless,
 I am the one who walks away.
 I am the one whose debts are many
 And I am the one who cannot pay.
 
[V3]
 You are the Lord who is my fortress;
 You are the Lord who is my hope.
 You are the Lord who is my refuge,
 The only safe place for my soul.
