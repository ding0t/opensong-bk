[V1]
 With His hands He made me,
 Breathed His life within me;
 With His heart He loved me,
 Yet I turned away.
 In His love He sought me,
 Came to earth to save me;
 Punished my rebellion
 With His sacrifice.
 
[C]
 I'll come to the Giver of life,
 I'll drink from His well of delights:
 I'll yield to His tender embrace,
 I'll be to Him an offering of praise.
 
[V2]
 Here I stand before You,
 Needing Your forgiveness,
 Thirsting for Your Spirit,
 Longing for Your touch.
 Let the flame within me
 Grow into a fire,
 Banish all my darkness
 With Your piercing light.
 
[C2]
 I'll come to the Giver of life,
 I'll drink from His well of delights:
 I'll yield to His tender embrace,
 I'll be to Him an offering.
 I'll rest in the shade of His wings,
 I'll feast on the pleasure He brings, 
 I'll seek Him for all of my days,
 I'll be to Him an offering of praise.
