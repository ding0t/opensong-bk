[V1]
 I believe in everything You do,
 All You have to say.
 I've come to realise You're the only way,
 Oh, I believe in You.
 
[V2]
 I've received something in my life
 Greater than before:
 Your truth has set me free and I love You, Lord,
 Oh, I believe in You.
 
[C]
 Let the angels sing of the Lord's great love,
 Well, it's shining down like the heavens above.
 Let the nations bow to the living God 
 And know Your truth,
 I believe in You.
 
[V3]
 I believe, I believe, 
 I believe, I believe in You.
 I believe, I believe, 
 I believe, I believe in You.
