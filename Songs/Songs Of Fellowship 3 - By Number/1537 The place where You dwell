[V1]
 The place where You dwell
 Is where I want to be,
 It's where angels in splendour
 Worship the King.
 And to Jesus in glory
 Each voice raised in song:
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
 
[V2]
 In the light of Your presence
 I find perfect peace,
 And my heart shall adore You
 And in You rejoice.
 And to Jesus victorious
 I lift up my song:
 Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.
 
[C]
 It's all for You, Jesus,
 Only You, Jesus.
 You are my song and my reason to sing;
 You have set this heart free
 To rise on the wings of Your praise.
