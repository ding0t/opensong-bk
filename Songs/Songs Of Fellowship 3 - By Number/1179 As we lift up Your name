[V1]
 (Leader + Echo)|
 As we lift up Your name,
 Let Your fire fall.
 Send Your wind and rain,
 On Your wings of love.
 ||(All)|
 Pour out from heaven 
 Your passion and presence,
 Bring down Your burning desire.
 
[C]
 Revival fire, fall!
 Revival fire, fall!
 Fall on us here
 In the power of Your Spirit;
 Father, let revival fire fall.
 ||Revival fire, fall!
 Revival fire, fall!
 Let the flame consume us
 With hearts ablaze for Jesus;
 Father, let revival fire fall!
 
[V2]
 (Leader - echo) |
 As we lift up Your name, 
 Let Your kingdom come,
 Have Your way in this place,
 Let Your will be done.
 ||(All) |
 Pour out from heaven 
 Your passion and presence,
 Bring down Your burning desire.
