[V1]
 You can have my whole life,
 You can come and have it all:
 I don't want to go my own way now,
 I love to feel Your presence
 And I know Your saving grace.
 I am nothing when You are second place.
 
[V2]
 I've been born to give You praise,
 Not to yearn and strive for worldly things.
 I've been born to love Your ways,
 Take my pride and let me always say:
 I want to go Your way now.
