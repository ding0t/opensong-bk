[V1]
 The narrow pathway 
 Through the needle's eye,
 I'm stepping forward 
 To the place I die.
 
[V2]
 For I know that You are faithful,
 As we walk these fields of white.
 To the waiting and the humble
 Your kingdom comes.
 
[V3]
 The way of mercy 
 Takes me to the least,
 Down the road of suffering 
 To the wedding feast.
 For I know that You are faithful,
 As we walk these fields of white.
 To the weary and the hurting
 Your kingdom comes.
