[V1]
 Holy one, righteous King,
 Merciful You are:
 Merciful I'll be.
 Broken One, bruised for me,
 In Your death, O Lord,
 You have set me free.
 
[C]
 Because Your Father loved me so,
 You came to me, Lord Jesus,
 So that I would know
 Love unconditional and life eternal,
 O my Lord, my God, my all.
 
[V2]
 Risen One, Majesty,
 Restoration, come
 Breathe new life in me.
 (Repeat)
