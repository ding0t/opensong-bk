[V1]
 O for a closer walk with God,
 A calm and heavenly frame.
 A light that shines upon the road,
 Leading to the Lamb.
 
[V2]
 Where is the bless√®dness I knew
 When I once saw the Lord?
 Where is the soul refreshing view
 Living in His word?
 
[C]
 A light to be my guide,
 The Father's presence at my side.
 In Your will my rest I find.
 O for a closer walk with God,
 Leading to the Lamb.
 
[V3]
 So shall my walk be close with God
 With all the hopes made new.
 So purer light shall mark the road
 Leading to the Lamb.
