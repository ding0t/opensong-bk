[C]
 I reach up high, I touch the ground,
 I stomp my feet and turn around.
 I've to (woo woo) praise the Lord.
 I jump and dance with all my might,
 I might look funny, but that's all right,
 I've got to (woo woo) praise the Lord.
 
[V1]
 I'll do anything just for my God
 'Cause He's done everything for me.
 It doesn't matter who is looking on,
 Jesus is the person that I want to please.
 
[V2]
 May my whole life be a song of praise,
 To worship God in every way.
 In this song the actions praise His name,
 I want my actions every day to do the same.
