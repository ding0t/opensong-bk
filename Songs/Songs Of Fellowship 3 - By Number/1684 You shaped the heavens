[V1]
 You shaped the heavens and the earth,
 Revealed Your splendour.
 You spoke Your life into our hearts,
 So we belong to You.
 
[C]
 You are the Maker of all things,
 First and the Last;
 Creation sings praise to You, God.
 You're reigning in glory,
 Ancient of Days;
 Your people sing praise to You, God.
 
[V2]
 Creator God, in You all things 
 Now hold together,
 Working Your wonders day by day,
 You'll reign forever.
 
[C2]
 And earth joins with heaven 
 Declaring Your glory;
 Proclaiming the works of Your hands.
 (Repeat)
