[V1]
 You said:
 'Ask and you will receive
 Whatever you need.'
 You said:
 'Pray, and I'll hear from heaven,
 And I'll heal your land.'
 
[V2]
 You said
 Your glory will fill the earth,
 Like water the sea.
 You said:
 'Lift up your eyes,
 The harvest is here,
 The kingdom is here.'
 
[C]
 You said:
 'Ask, and I'll give the nations to you.'
 O Lord, that's the cry of my heart.
 Distant shores and the islands will see 
 Your light as it rises on us.
 
[V3]
 O Lord, I ask for the nations.
