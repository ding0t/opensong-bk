[V1]
 Your love has captured me,
 Your grace has set me free;
 Your life, the air I breathe:
 Be glorified in me.
 
[V2]
 You set my feet to dancing, 
 You set my heart on fire,
 In the presence of a thousand kings
 You are my one desire.
 And I stand before You now
 With trembling hands lifted high,
 Be glorified.
