[V1]
 Lord of every heart,
 I'm coming back to You.
 I'm standing in the shallows
 Of what Your love can do;
 Remembering the joy 
 Of laughter in the rain,
 I'm calling from the desert,
 Won't You fill me again?
 
[C]
 Fill me again, won't You fill me again?
 I'm tired and I'm thirsty
 And I've come to the end.
 Come cleanse me with fire,
 Refresh me with rain.
 O Breath of the Spirit, come closer.
 
[V2]
 Lord of every deed,
 Your promise is enough;
 You're unreserved in mercy,
 And unrestrained in love.
 I'm casting down these crowns
 Of all that I can do;
 I'm trading my ambitions
 For a touch of You.
