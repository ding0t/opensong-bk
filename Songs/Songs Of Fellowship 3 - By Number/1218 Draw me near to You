[V1]
 Draw me near to You;
 Can I come so close 
 That I can hear Your song of love 
 That heals my broken heart?
 
[C]
 And I will walk with You,
 Another footstep now.
 Can we walk on again,
 Another footstep now?
 ||I've walked in fields of pain,
 I've sheltered in Your love;
 In the valley of death's shadow,
 I will fear no evil,
 For You are here with me.
 My comfort be, my comfort be.
 
[V2]
 Draw me near to You,
 Even closer still,
 So I can see Your scars of love
 That saved my wounded soul.
