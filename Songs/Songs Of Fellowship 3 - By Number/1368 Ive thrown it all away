[V1]
 I've thrown it all away
 That I might gain a life in You.
 I've found all else is loss
 Compared to the joys of knowing You.
 Your beauty and Your majesty
 Are far beyond compare:
 You've won my heart,
 Now this will be my prayer.
 
[C]
 'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
 You're the treasure in this life.
 'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
 Is my cry.
 Now I've seen You as the Saviour,
 I will leave the rest behind:
 'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
 Is my cry.
 
[V2]
 Into the world I'll go
 That I might live this life of love.
 I won't be overcome,
 For You are in me and You are strong.
 For time and for eternity
 I know I'm in Your care;
 You've won my heart,
 Now this will be my prayer.
