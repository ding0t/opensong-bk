[V1]
 (Men - women echo)
 We're longing for Your presence, 
 We're waiting on Your promise,
 That You will flood the nation
 With mercy and with justice.
 ||We've tasted of Your goodness,
 We've waded in Your river,
 Yet still the streets are deserts,
 And men cry out in hunger.
 Let sinners find forgiveness,
 The lonely find a family;
 Cause lips that mock and curse You
 To sing of Your salvation.
 
[C1]
 (All)
 Open the heavens and come down.
 Come in Your glory and Your power.
 Send Your revival rain:
 Replenish this land again!
 Open the heavens and come down,
 Come down!
 
[V2]
 (Men - women echo)
 We want a way of living 
 That ushers in Your kingdom:
 Faith, purity and passion,
 And love without condition.
 ||Come shake the ground on which we stand,
 Till all we need is found in You;
 Then pour the fire into our hearts
 To do the work that You would do.
 
[C2]
 Open the heavens and come down.
 Come in Your glory and Your power.
 Send Your revival rain:
 Replenish this heart again!
 Open the heavens and come down,
 Come down!
