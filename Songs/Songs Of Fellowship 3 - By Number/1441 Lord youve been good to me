[V1]
 Lord, you've been good to me 
 All my life, all my life;
 Your loving kindness never fails.
 I will remember all You have done,
 Bring from my heart thanksgiving songs.
 
[C]
 New every morning is Your love,
 Filled with compassion from above.
 Grace and forgiveness full and free,
 Lord, You've been good to me.
 
[V2]
 So, may each breath I take
 Be for You, Lord, only You,
 Giving You back the life I owe.
 Love so amazing, mercy so free.
 Lord, You've been good,
 So good to me.
