[V1]
 Your love is amazing, 
 Steady and unchanging;
 Your love is a mountain, 
 Firm beneath my feet.
 Your love is a mystery,
 How You gently lift me;
 When I am surrounded, 
 Your love carries me.
 
[C]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
 
[V2]
 Your love is surprising, 
 I can feel it rising,
 All the joy that's growing 
 Deep inside of me.
 Every time I see You, 
 All Your goodness shines through,
 And I can feel this God song
 Rising up in me.
