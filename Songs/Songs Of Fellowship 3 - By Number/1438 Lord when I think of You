[V1]
 Lord, when I think of You,
 And what I put You through,
 I'll never understand Your endless mercy.
 ||To think You chose to come,
 Embodied in Your Son
 To fall into the hands of Your created.
 Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.
 
[C]
 I give You all my love, I give You everything.
 You are God of heaven, and head over heels with me!
 I know You burn with passion, when I call on Your name,
 Your love runs as a river, washing my shame away, 
 Restoring my faith again, yeah.
 
[V2]
 How did You look upon
 The sight of Your own blood?
 You even took the sin of those who nailed You!
 ||For grace and justice meet
 In Him who's chosen me
 To walk a path that takes me on to heaven.
 Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.
