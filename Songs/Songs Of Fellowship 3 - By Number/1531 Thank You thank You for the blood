[V1]
 Thank You, thank You for the blood that You shed,
 Standing in its blessing we sing these freedom songs.
 Thank You, thank You for the battle You won,
 Standing in Your victory we sing salvation songs,
 We sing salvation's song.
 
[V2]
 You have opened the way to the Father,
 When before we could never have come.
 Jesus, count us as Yours now forever,
 As we sing these freedom songs.
 
[C]
 We sing of all You've done,
 We sing of all You've done,
 We sing of all You've done for us,
 Won for us, paid for us.
 (Repeat)
